## The Internet Never Forgets

Given the nominee for the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos did not know that IDEA was a thing, it's not a stretch to think she didn't know that the internet never forgets.

Well gosh hun, it sure doesn't.

When the news broke over February 11, 2017 weekend that the IDEA website had been taken down, we knew something had to be done. Read the article we read about this take-down here: ["Website for disabled kids disappears as DeVos takes office"](http://www.sfgate.com/local/politics/article/A-disability-website-disappears-Murray-10924413.php)

## Copyright and Ownership Etc.

Obviously this isn't our content... in that we didn't create it. It IS our content in that we are taxpaying citizens of the United States, and this content was created by people employed by the U.S. government. So, they were working for us when they made these pages, which seems good enough for putting this content back up.

## Where Did It Come From?

Thank the good folks over at the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).

## I Found A Broken Thing

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/resistere/idea.ed.gov/issues) and let us know! We did pull this site together out of thin air (with the help of the Wayback Machine), so it's not going to be 100% functional. It's the closest we can get until such a time when this content re-appears in an official capacity.

## Know The People Who Created The Original?

If you know someone who knows someone who knows someone who worked on this site at the Education Department who might be able to help us fill in some blanks, PLEASE put us in contact!
