SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On December 3, 2004, the President signed into law Pub. L. 108-446, 
118 Stat. 2647, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement 
Act of 2004, amending the IDEA. Copies of the new law may be obtained 
at the following Web site: <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plaws/index.html">http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plaws/index.html</a>.

    Enactment of the new law provides an opportunity to consider 
improvements in the regulations implementing the IDEA in 34 CFR parts 
300 and 303 that would strengthen the Federal effort to ensure the 
provision of early intervention services to infants and toddlers with 
disabilities and their families and ensure every child with a 
disability has available a free appropriate public education that: (1) 
Is of high quality, and (2) is designed to achieve the high standards 
reflected in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.

Invitation To Comment

    We invite you to submit comments and recommendations regarding 
changes to 34 CFR parts 300 and 303 that you believe are needed, 
particularly to clarify a provision in the new law or to facilitate its 
implementation. We encourage you to make your comments as specific as 
possible regarding the nature and scope of regulatory action necessary 
to achieve the objective you are seeking. Also, if appropriate to your 
comments, please identify the specific part and section (or subsection) 
of the amended IDEA that is the subject of your recommendations, and 
specify how a proposed change to a given provision in the regulations 
will clarify or help to improve implementation of the new statutory 
provision.
    Please include the following with your comments and 
recommendations: A description of the area of your involvement in 
special education, regular education or early intervention, as well as 
your role, if any, in that area (e.g., parent, teacher, student, 
service provider, administrator, or researcher).
    During and after the comment period, you may inspect all public 
comments about this notice in room 5126, Potomac Center Plaza, 550 12th 
Street, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., 
eastern time, Monday through Friday of each week except Federal 
holidays.

Assistance to Individuals With Disabilities in Reviewing the Comments

    On request, we will supply an appropriate aid, such as a reader or 
print magnifier, to an individual with a disability who needs 
assistance to review the comments and recommendations. If you want to 
schedule an appointment for this type of aid, please contact the person 
listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

series of informal meetings during the first few months of calendar

following locations:
     Atlanta, GA;
     Newark, NJ;
     Boston, MA;
