Time limit; minimum procedures (Sec. 300.152(a))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested changing Sec. 300.152(a)(1), to include situations when the SEA is the subject of a complaint.  Another commenter recommended that the State complaint procedures include how the SEA should handle a complaint against the SEA for its failure to supervise the LEA or failure to provide direct services when given notice that the LEA has failed to so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to specify in the regulations how the SEA should handle a complaint filed against the SEA because Sec. 300.151 clarifies that, if an organization or individual files a complaint, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, the SEA must resolve the complaint.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.33 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, the term public agency includes the SEA.  The SEA must, therefore, resolve any complaint against the SEA pursuant to the SEA's adopted State complaint procedures.  The SEA, however, may either appoint its own personnel to resolve the complaint, or may make arrangements with an outside party to resolve the complaint.  If it chooses to use an outside party, however, the SEA remains responsible for complying with all procedural and remediation steps required in part 300.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested that the regulations include language requiring an on-site investigation unless the SEA determines that it can collect all evidence and fairly determine whether a violation has occurred with the evidence provided by the complainant and a review of records.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the regulations should require the SEA to conduct an on-site investigation in the manner suggested by the commenter because we believe Sec. 300.152(a)(1) is sufficient to ensure that an independent on-site investigation is carried out if the SEA determines that such an investigation is necessary to resolve a complaint.  The minimum State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152 are intended to be broad in recognition of the fact that States operate differently and standards appropriate to one State may not be appropriate in another State.  Therefore, the standards to be used in conducting an on-site investigation are best determined by the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.152 would allow an unlimited period of time to resolve complaints and requested that the regulations limit the complaint resolution process to 30 days, similar to the procedures when a due process hearing is requested.  A few commenters requested that the 60-day time limit be lengthened to 90 days, given that many complaints involve complex issues and multiple interviews with school administrators.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.  We believe altering this timeframe would be unnecessarily disruptive to States' developed complaint procedures.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is appropriate to change the time limit as recommended by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the regulations are silent as to how an amended State complaint should be handled.  One commenter expressed concern about resolving complaints within the 60-day time limit when the complainant submits additional information about the complaint and amends the complaint.  The commenter requested that in such cases, the regulations should allow the 60-day time limit to begin from the date the State receives the amended complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152 provides that the complaint must be resolved 60 days after a complaint is filed and that the complainant must be given an opportunity to submit additional information, either orally or in writing, about the allegations in the complaint.  Generally, if the additional information a parent submits is on the same or related incident, it would be part of the amended complaint.  If the information submitted by the complainant is on a different or unrelated incident, generally, the new information would be treated as a separate complaint.  On the other hand, if the information submitted by the complainant were on the same incident, generally, the new information would be treated as an amendment to the original complaint.  It is, ultimately, left to each State to determine whether the new information constitutes a new complaint or whether it is related to a pending complaint.  We believe the decision regarding whether the additional information is a new complaint or an amendment to an existing complaint, is best left to the State.  The State must have the flexibility to make this determination based on the circumstances of a particular complaint and consistent with its State complaint process and, therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to regulate further on this matter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
There are no provisions in Part B of the Act or in these regulations that permit the 60-day time limit to begin from the date the State receives an amended complaint, if additional information submitted by the complainant results in an amendment to the complaint.  However, Sec. 300.152(b) permits an extension of the 60-day time limit if exceptional circumstances exist or the parent and the public agency agree to extend the time limit to attempt to resolve the complaint through mediation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding the time limit for a public agency to respond with a proposal to resolve the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The 60-day time limit to resolve a complaint does not change if a public agency decides to respond to the complaint with a proposal to resolve the complaint.  However, Sec. 300.152(b)(2) permits the 60-day time limit to be extended under exceptional circumstances or if the parent and public agency agree to engage in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.152(a) could limit the SEA's investigation of a complaint to an exchange of papers since the SEA is not required to conduct an on-site investigation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152 provides that the SEA must review all relevant information and, if it determines it to be necessary, carry out an independent on-site investigation in order to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300.  We believe the SEA is in the best position, and should have the flexibility, to determine what information is necessary to resolve a complaint, based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.  It is true that, in some cases, a review of documents provided by the parties may be sufficient for the SEA to resolve a complaint and that conducting an on-site investigation or interviews with staff, for example, may be unnecessary.  The SEA, based on the facts in the case, must decide whether an on-site investigation is necessary.  We also believe requiring an on-site investigation for each State complaint would be overly burdensome for public agencies and unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested adding language to proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3) to allow an SEA to provide opportunities for resolving the complaint through mediation and other informal mechanisms for dispute resolution with any party filing a complaint, not only the parents.  Some commenters requested that the regulations clarify that mediation is the appropriate method to resolve State complaints regarding the denial of appropriate services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters expressed concern that the phrase "[w]ith the consent of the parent" in proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3) implies that complaints are disagreements between parents and public agencies, rather than allegations of violations of a child's or a parent's rights under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters supported the use of mediation to resolve a complaint, but requested that alternative means of dispute resolution be deleted.  Other commenters expressed concern that providing yet another means of initiating mediation or other dispute resolution is unnecessary because these options are already available to parties who wish to use them.  A few commenters requested that the regulations define alternative means of dispute resolution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152(a)(3) was proposed to encourage meaningful, informal, resolution of disputes between the public agency and parents, organizations, or other individuals by providing an opportunity for parties to resolve disputes at the local level without the need for the SEA to resolve the matter.  We believe that, at a minimum, the State's complaint procedures should allow the public agency that is the subject of the complaint the opportunity to respond to a complaint by proposing a resolution and provide an opportunity for a parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to resolve a dispute by voluntarily engaging in mediation.  However, we do not believe that the SEA should be required to offer other alternative means of dispute resolution, and so will remove the reference to these other alternatives from the minimum procedures in Sec. 300.152(a)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe it is important to retain the provision in Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)), with modification, to reinforce the use of voluntary mediation as a viable option for resolving disputes between the public agency and the parents at the local level prior to the SEA investigating, if necessary, and resolving a dispute.  Resolving disputes between parties at the local level through the use of mediation, or other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State, will be less adversarial and less time consuming and expensive than a State complaint investigation, if necessary, or a due process hearing and, ultimately, children with disabilities will be the beneficiaries of a local level resolution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Requiring that the public agency provide an opportunity for the parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to voluntarily engage in mediation in an effort to resolve a dispute is an appropriate minimum requirement and consistent with the statutory provision in section 615(e) of the Act that voluntary mediation be made available to parties (i.e., parent and public agency) to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint.  However, the statute does not require that mediation be available to other parties, and we believe it would be burdensome to expand, through regulation, new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) to require that States offer mediation to non-parents.  Although we do not believe we should regulate to require that mediation be offered to non-parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude an SEA from permitting the use of mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, if available in the State, to resolve a State complaint filed by an organization or individual other than a parent, and we will add language to Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to permit extensions of the timeline if the parties are voluntarily engaged in any of these dispute resolution procedures.  In fact, we encourage SEAs and their public agencies to consider alternative means of resolving disputes between the public agency and organizations or other individuals, at the local level, consistent with State law and administrative procedures.  It is up to each State, however, to determine whether non-parents can use mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 615(e) of the Act makes clear that mediation is a voluntary mechanism for resolving disputes and may not be used to delay or deny a parent's right to a due process hearing on the parent's due process complaint, or to deny any other rights afforded under Part B of the Act.  In light of the fact that mediation is a voluntary process, the parties only need to agree to engage in mediation and it is not necessary to obtain parental written consent to engage in this voluntary process.  We will, therefore, change new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) by removing the phrase "[w]ith the consent of the parent" and adding a reference to Sec. 300.506.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to include in the regulations a definition of the term "alternative means of dispute resolution" because the term is generally understood to refer to other procedures and processes that States have found to be effective in resolving disputes quickly and effectively but does not include those dispute resolution processes required under the Act or these final regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) by removing "with the consent of the parent" and "or other alternative means of dispute resolution" and adding a reference to Sec. 300.506.  We have also amended Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii), as stated above, to clarify that a public agency's State complaint procedures must permit an extension of the 60-day time limit if a parent (or individual or organization, if mediation, or other alternative means of dispute resolution is available to the individual or organization under State procedures) who has filed a complaint and the public agency voluntarily agree to extend the time to engage in mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the agreement to extend the 60-day time limit (to allow the parties to engage in mediation, or alternative means of dispute resolution, or both) should meet the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9.  One commenter requested an extension of the 60-day time limit to resolve complaints when mediation is underway.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9, should be required to extend the 60-day time limit because it would add burden and is not necessary.  It is sufficient to require agreement of the parties.  At any time that either party withdraws from mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution, or withdraws agreement to the extension of the time limit, the extension would end.  We believe Sec. 300.152(b) is sufficiently clear that an extension of the 60-day time limit is permissible if exceptional circumstances exist with respect to a particular complaint, or if the parent and the public agency agree to extend the time to engage in mediation.  We also believe it would be permissible to extend the 60-day time limit if the public agency and an organization or other individual agree to engage in an alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State, and the parties agree to extend the 60-day time limit.  We will revise Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to include this exception.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to clarify that it would be permissible to extend the 60-day time limit if the parties agree to engage in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested that Sec. 300.152(a) be modified to include language allowing parents, in addition to the public agency, an opportunity to submit a proposal to resolve the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to include the language in Sec. 300.152(a) as suggested by the commenter because Sec. 300.153(b)(4)(v) already requires that the signed written complaint submitted to the SEA by the complainant include a proposed resolution to the problem.  A parent who is a complainant must include a proposed resolution to the problem to the extent known and available to the parent at the time the complaint is filed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
