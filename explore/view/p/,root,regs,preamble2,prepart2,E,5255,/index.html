Hearing Rights (Sec.  300.512)     
<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Several commenters supported proposed Sec.  300.512 
stating that a parent's right to be represented by non-attorneys at due 
process hearings is best decided by State law. Other commenters 
disagreed with our statement in the preamble to the NPRM that the 
language of the Act is not clear about whether non-attorneys can 
represent parties in due process hearings. These commenters stated that 
the Act and its implementing regulations both provide that any party to 
a hearing shall be accorded the right to be accompanied and advised 
``by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with 
respect to the problems of children with disabilities * * *.'' The 
commenters stated that because the term ``counsel'' is referenced 
separately and distinguished from ``individuals with special knowledge 
or training'' in both the Act and the regulations, the Department 
should conclude that such ``individuals'' may, in fact, be other than 
counsel (i.e., attorneys) and represent a parent in a due process 
hearing. One commenter noted that experienced advocates can be very 
helpful to parents who represent themselves in due process hearings. 
Another commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 should not permit 
a State's rules related to the unauthorized practice of law to prohibit 
a parent from being ``accompanied and advised'' by a lay advocate 
because this would be contrary to the actual text of the Act. Moreover, 
several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 violates the 
intent of the Act, which they describe as providing parents with the 
broadest opportunities for assistance in due process hearings. These 
commenters stated further that nothing in the language or intent of the 
Act permits the Department's interpretation that States have the 
authority to decide whether parents can be represented by non-attorneys 
in due process hearings under the Act.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 615(h)(1) of the Act is clear that parties to a 
due process hearing may be ``accompanied and advised'' by counsel and 
by individuals, such as non-attorney advocates, who have special 
knowledge or training regarding the problems of children with 
disabilities. Nothing in these regulations or State law can limit this 
right. However, neither the Act nor the current regulations 
implementing Part B of the Act address the issue of whether individuals 
who are not attorneys, but have special knowledge or training regarding 
the problems of children with disabilities, may ``represent'' parties 
in due process hearings under the Act. Congress considered the question 
of non-attorney representation during the 2003-2004 IDEA 
reauthorization process. The version of H.R. 1350 passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2003 included a provision giving a party the 
``right to be represented by counsel and by non-attorney advocates and 
to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or 
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities'' 
(63 Cong. Rec. H3458 and H3495 (daily ed. Apr. 30, 2003)). The final 
version of the bill enacted in 2004, however, did not adopt this 
language. In other areas, though, the Act, as revised in 2004, now 
specifically addresses duties applicable to ``either party, or the 
attorney representing a party'' (see section 615(b)(7)(A) and (B) of 
the Act). Given that the Act is silent regarding the representational 
role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of 
whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties to a due process 
hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to 
decide. As the commenter notes, even if a State law prohibits non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, the Act still affords 
parties to due process hearings the right to be accompanied and advised 
by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
problems of children with disabilities.

Comment: Several commenters expressed dissatisfaction with proposed 
Sec.  300.512 because it would give too much deference to States, 
permit inconsistent rules across States, and would limit a party's 
right under Federal law to be represented by a non-attorney in a due 
process hearing based on States' interest in regulating the practice of 
law. Other commenters stated that federalism concerns should not 
override the national interest, reflected in the Act, in the equal 
opportunity of children with disabilities to appropriate education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: As noted elsewhere in this preamble, the Act does not 
state that parties to a due process hearing have a right to 
representation in those hearings by non-attorney advocates. Given the 
Act's silence in this regard, the Act does not prevent States from 
regulating whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties in due 
process hearings.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter requested that the final regulations clarify 
whether it is sufficient for an SEA to provide by regulation or procedural rule 
that a lay advocate may represent parties at due process hearings or 
whether the ability of a lay advocate to represent a party at a due 
process hearing instead is controlled by State law regarding the 
unauthorized practice of law. Another commenter requested that we add a 
provision to the regulations to clarify that nothing in the Act 
authorizes parents to be represented by non-attorneys if State law is 
silent on the issue.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Whether an SEA may have a State regulation or 
procedural rule permitting non-attorney advocates to represent parties 
at due process hearings or whether that issue is controlled by State 
attorney practice laws is determined by State law. If State law is 
silent on the question of whether non-attorney advocates can represent 
parties in due process hearings, there is no prohibition under the Act 
or its implementing regulations on non-attorney advocates assuming a 
representational role in due process hearings.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Many commenters asserted that the proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 would negatively affect future cases as parents unable to 
afford attorneys' fees, or unable to find an attorney knowledgeable 
about special education law, will be faced with the choice of either 
representing themselves or foregoing a due process hearing. Other 
commenters suggested that the proposed regulatory change has the 
potential to disrupt the State system of administrative due process 
hearings when lay advocates are not available to assist parents. One 
commenter noted that lay advocates are necessary to help represent 
parents because school officials are more knowledgeable about the law 
than parents, and there are more school lawyers than there are lawyers 
willing to represent parents in due process hearings. Some commenters 
noted that publicly funded programs providing legal representation to 
persons with disabilities are not funded at the level that meets the 
need for free or low-cost assistance. Another commenter noted that non-
attorney advocates provide a necessary and valuable service to children 
with disabilities, and that limiting the role of non-attorney advocates 
will adversely affect the rights of children with disabilities in due 
process hearings. Other commenters argued that lay advocates serve an 
important function and are an excellent resource for families.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree with the commenters that non-attorney 
advocates can perform a valuable service to parties in due process 
hearings. As just one example, non-attorney advisors with special 
knowledge of or training in the problems of children with disabilities 
who speak languages other than English can play an important role in 
accompanying and advising parents who do not speak English at due 
process hearings. However, because the Act is silent about the 
representational role of non-attorneys in due process hearings, States 
are not prohibited by the Act from regulating on that issue. Therefore, 
we make clear, in Sec.  300.512, that whether non-attorneys can 
``represent'' parties in due process hearings is a matter that is 
controlled by State law. There currently are States that prohibit non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, and parties to due 
process hearings in those States need to understand that they may not 
be ``represented'' in a due process hearing by a non-attorney, although 
they may be ``accompanied and advised'' by a non-attorney in the due 
process hearing if that individual has special knowledge or training 
respecting the problems of children with disabilities.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: A few commenters recommended that States be required to 
provide parents with a list of available and affordable attorneys if 
State law does not allow for non-attorney representation in due process 
hearings. The commenters also recommended that the Department identify 
strategies to ensure that parents have access to free or reduced-fee 
representation by knowledgeable attorneys when legal counsel is 
necessary, such as appealing due process decisions in court.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Current Sec.  300.507 requires public agencies to 
inform a parent of any free or low-cost legal and other relevant 
services in the area if the parent requests the information or if the 
parent or public agency files a due process complaint. We expect States 
to work to ensure that parents for whom legal counsel under Part B of 
the Act is necessary have easy access to information about free or low-
cost legal or other relevant services available in their area. Each 
State is in the best position to determine effective strategies to 
ensure that parents have access to information about free or low-cost 
assistance. For these reasons, we decline to make the requested changes 
to these regulations.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter opposed the proposed changes to Sec.  
300.512 and expressed concern that these changes will limit parents' 
representation during the IEP process. Another commenter stated that 
parents are intended to be ``equal partners'' in the educational 
decision-making process for their child under the Act, and therefore, 
should be able to utilize non-attorney assistance whenever necessary. 
Some commenters stated that effective advocacy is necessary to ensure 
that children have access to the services and programs necessary to 
develop an appropriate IEP.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree with commenters that parents should be equal 
partners in the educational decision-making process for their child and 
that parents should be able to utilize assistance from non-attorney 
advocates whenever necessary, such as in securing an appropriate IEP 
for their child and, as noted previously in this preamble, in preparing 
for and participating in due process hearings. The proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 only address whether a party can be represented by a non-
attorney in a due process hearing, specifying that this matter is 
determined by State law. Whether parents may be ``represented'' by non-
attorney advocates at other stages of the process is not addressed by 
the Act and also depends on State law. That said, under Sec.  
300.321(a)(6), the IEP Team may include, at the discretion of the 
parent or public agency, individuals who have knowledge or special 
expertise regarding the child, including non-attorney advocates. While 
these individuals are members of the IEP Team, their role is not to 
``represent'' or speak for the parents.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec.  
300.512 could lead to confusion because not all States have a clear 
position as to whether lay advocates can represent parents at due 
process hearings. Some of these commenters noted that 10 States 
currently bar lay advocates, 12 States permit lay advocates to 
represent parents in due process hearings, and that the positions of 
the remaining States are unclear. Given this disparity across States, 
these commenters expressed concern that leaving the decision to States 
could lead to more confusion and litigation, not less. A few commenters 
questioned whether States would be required to amend their laws to 
specify whether lay advocates can represent parties in due process 
hearings.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 raises an issue to 
the national level that is only a problem in a few jurisdictions, and 
would lead to increased, and tangential, disputes. Another commenter 
stated that appropriate representation should remain a matter of State law, but 
that the Department should not make the changes proposed to Sec.  
300.512 in the NPRM.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree with commenters that confusion will result 
from the changes reflected in proposed Sec.  300.512. To the contrary, 
we expect that the effect of this amended provision will be to reduce 
confusion and the potential for litigation because parties will know to 
look to State law to determine whether non-attorneys can represent 
parties in due process hearings; States will know they are free to 
continue to permit or prohibit such representation. In the absence of 
State law on this point, there is nothing in the Act or these 
regulations that would prohibit non-attorneys with special knowledge or 
training respecting the problems of children with disabilities from 
representing parties in due process hearings. Nothing in proposed Sec.  
300.512 requires States to adopt changes to State law to address this 
issue.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Even though a relatively small number of States may prohibit non-
attorneys from representing parties in IDEA due process hearings, it is 
still important for the Department to address this issue in its 
regulations. In the absence of that clarification, parties may not 
consider this issue at the time they are making decisions about how to 
proceed in a due process hearing, or may mistakenly rely on the April 
8, 1981 letter from Theodore Sky, Acting General Counsel of the 
Department of Education, to the Honorable Frank B. Brouillet, in which 
the Department interpreted section 615 of the Act and implementing 
regulations to mean that attorneys and lay advocates may perform the 
same functions at due process hearings. As noted in the NPRM, the 
Department no longer interprets section 615 of the Act and implementing 
regulations in this manner. Nothing in amended Sec.  300.512 should 
increase disputes, or raise an issue that is not already an issue under 
State law.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter noted that non-attorney lay advocates have 
long represented underprivileged persons in a variety of administrative 
hearings, including those concerning veterans' benefits, welfare 
benefits, and social security benefits.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The programs cited by the commenter are Federal 
programs under which administrative hearings are conducted before the 
Federal agency. Due process hearings under IDEA, however, are conducted 
before a local or State hearing officer, as determined under State law. 
Absent specific statutory authority to require States to permit non-
attorney representation, we do not believe we should impose such a 
requirement on States.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: A number of commenters stated that in some States school 
districts are represented by lay advocates and expressed concern that a 
rule applying only to parents would be both inconsistent and unfair. 
Some commenters stated that State regulations of the practice of law 
should affect equally parents and school districts. One commenter 
reported that lay advocates commonly represent a school district, but 
are not subject to license-based sanctions or censure or held to the 
legal profession's standards of candor and fair dealing. Others noted 
that school districts are often ``represented'' at hearings by agency 
representatives, including special education directors or other 
administrators, rather than attorneys.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree with the commenters that a further change is 
needed to Sec.  300.512 to specify that State law controls whether non-
attorneys can represent any party in a due process hearing under the 
Act. We are persuaded by commenters who pointed out that public 
agencies also retain non-attorney advocates, and agree that the Act's 
silence on the matter of non-attorney representation in a due process 
hearing means that State law applies to all parties to a due process 
hearing.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: We have revised the exception clause in Sec.  
300.512(a)(1) to specify that whether parties have the right to be 
represented by non-attorneys at due process hearings is determined 
under State law.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 
violates section 607 of the Act, which prohibits the adoption of any 
regulation that procedurally or substantively lessens the protections 
provided to children with disabilities in the regulations in effect on 
July 20, 1983 unless the regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal 
intent of Congress in legislation. These commenters noted that proposed 
Sec.  300.512 was not in effect in 1983 and that no legislative change 
has been made to the right ``to be accompanied and advised by counsel 
and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to 
the problems of children with disabilities.''
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree that the change reflected in proposed Sec.  
300.512 violates the provisions of section 607 of the Act. As the 
regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983 did not address 
whether non-attorneys could ``represent'' parties to due process 
hearings, the regulations in effect at that time did not embody a right 
to representation by non-attorneys. Section 607 of the Act does not 
prevent the Department from addressing rights that were not in the 
regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983.

Comment: One commenter asked who proposed the changes to Sec.  
300.512, on what data the changes were based, and whether the 
Protection and Advocacy system was involved in proposing the changes to 
this section.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The Department proposed the changes to Sec.  300.512 
because we came to accept, after the Delaware Supreme Court's decision 
in In re Arons, 756 A.2d 867 (Del. 2000), cert. denied sub nom, Arons 
v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 532 U.S. 1065 (2001), that the 
interpretation of the regulations in the 1981 letter from the Acting 
General Counsel of the Department was not persuasive, and that, because 
the Act does not specifically address non-attorney representation in 
due process hearings, State law controls whether non-attorneys can 
represent parties to due process hearings. The Protection and Advocacy 
system was not involved in proposing the change.

Comment: One commenter expressed concern that the proposed changes 
in Sec.  300.512 would increase the number of lawsuits against school 
districts by requiring the use of a lawyer and court action.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree with this comment because Sec.  300.512 
does not require the use of lawyers and does not concern court actions.

Comment: A number of commenters stated that the issue of whether to 
allow parents to be represented by non-lawyers in IDEA due process 
hearings should be left to Congress to resolve. Many of these 
commenters stated that given the pending reauthorization of the Act, 
regulating on this topic is premature. Some commenters stated that this 
issue should be reviewed in Congressional oversight hearings. Many 
commenters argued that there is a need for review and consideration of 
available research data, or that research should first be conducted on 
the special education administrative due process systems of States and 
districts, before a change is made. Others called for research on the 
availability of legal representation for parents in due process 
hearings before a change in the Department's policy is made.
Discussion: We disagree with commenters that this matter should be 
left to Congress to resolve or that it is premature to address this 
issue given the pending reauthorization of the Act. Participants in due 
process hearings should understand that, under the current state of the 
law, the Act does not prohibit States from determining whether parties 
to due process hearings can be represented in those hearings by non-
attorneys. We also disagree with commenters that additional research is 
needed to better understand the current state of State law on this 
issue before amending Sec.  300.512. That said, we agree that 
additional information about the availability of legal representation 
for parties might be useful in helping Congress decide whether a change 
in the statute is advisable.

Comment: A number of commenters remarked that Congressional 
inaction on the issue of lay advocate representation of parties in due 
process hearings after the Arons decision indicates that Congress did 
not mean to reverse the Department's longstanding policy that the Act 
permits non-attorney representation.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We do not agree that Congressional acquiescence in the 
Department's prior interpretation can be inferred in this case. The 
commenters' assessment of the reasons that Congress decided to take no 
action in this regard is speculative. Congress was aware, at the time 
of the 2004 reauthorization, that non-attorneys were not permitted to 
represent parties in due process hearings in at least one State, 
Delaware. Therefore, we cannot assume that Congressional inaction meant 
that Congress viewed the Department's prior interpretation as 
controlling. Lack of congressional action could also mean that Congress 
believed that the Arons case was correctly decided, and that State law 
should control the representational role of non-attorneys in IDEA due 
process hearings.
