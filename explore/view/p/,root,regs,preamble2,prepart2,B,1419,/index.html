Access to instructional materials (Sec. 300.172)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended including the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS) in these regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter.  The final NIMAS was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084) and will be included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard of these regulations.  We will add language in Sec. 300.172(a) to refer to this location and to reference the publication date of the NIMAS in the Federal Register.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  The final NIMAS has been added as appendix C to part 300.  We have added language in Sec. 300.172(a) to refer to the location of the NIMAS in these regulations and the publication date of the NIMAS in the Federal Register.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that the language requiring States to adopt the NIMAS "in a timely manner" is ambiguous and could lead to delays in providing instructional materials to children with disabilities, inconsistencies across States, and increased litigation.  Several commenters requested that the regulations specify a timeline for States to adopt the NIMAS.  Some commenters recommended requiring all States to adopt the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  However, one commenter stated that States should not be given a deadline to adopt the NIMAS.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A number of commenters requested that the regulations define the meaning of "adopt" in Sec. 300.172(a) and specify what States must do to adopt the NIMAS.  Several commenters recommended defining "adopt" to mean that the State, through regulatory or legislative procedures, designates NIMAS as the only required source format for publishers to convert print instructional materials into specialized formats for children with disabilities.  One commenter urged the Department to define "adopt" to mean that a State must accept a NIMAS file as satisfying the publisher's legal obligation to provide accessible instructional materials.  Other commenters recommended that the regulations clearly state that adoption of the NIMAS means that SEAs and LEAs must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format that are provided by the publishers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.172(a), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(A) of the Act, requires States to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner after the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  As noted in the discussion to the previous comment, the NIMAS is included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard and was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084).  The Department believes that States should make every effort to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner following the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register, recognizing that the timelines and requirements for adopting new rules, policies, or procedures vary from State to State.  States choosing to coordinate with the NIMAC must, consistent with section 612(a)(23)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.172(c) of these regulations, not later than December 3, 2006, as part of any print instructional materials adoption process, procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the publisher of the print instructional materials to:  (1) require the publisher to prepare and, on or before delivery of the print instructional materials, provide the NIMAC with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the NIMAS; or (2) purchase instructional materials from the publisher that are produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.  Clearly, we would expect that these States would have adopted the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  We decline to require a specific adoption date for all States, however, given the lack of specificity in the Act.  We also decline to include a definition of "adopt" in these regulations because requirements for adopting new rules and policies may vary from State to State.  The Department's view is that it is inherent in the adoption requirement that, at a minimum, upon "adoption" of the NIMAS, a State must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  Under Sec. 300.172(a), adopting the NIMAS is a State responsibility and does not impose any legal obligations on publishers of instructional materials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have made technical changes in Sec. 300.172(c).  For clarity, we have replaced the phrase "not later than" with "as of."  We have removed the phrase "two years after the date of enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004" because it is unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring States to comply with the requirements for public hearings and public comment in section 612(a)(19) of the Act before adopting policies and procedures to implement the requirements in Sec. 300.172 related to access to instructional materials.  The commenter stated that all interested members of the public, including parents of children with disabilities, are entitled to participate in designing the plan for implementing these policies and procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.165(a), consistent with section 612(a)(19) of the Act, requires States to hold public hearings and receive public comment before implementing any policies and procedures needed to comply with Part B of the Act.  These public hearing and public comment requirements apply to the policies and procedures needed to implement the requirements in Sec. 300.172.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification on whether the NIMAS is limited to print materials on the medium of paper or also includes the iconic representation of letters and words.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The NIMAS is the standard established by the Secretary to be used in the preparation of electronic files of print instructional materials so they can be more easily converted to accessible formats, such as Braille.  In addition to print materials, the NIMAS provides standards for textbooks and related core materials where icons replace text.  Materials with icons will be available if they are in printed textbooks and related printed core materials that are written and published primarily for use in elementary school and secondary school instruction and are required by an SEA or LEA for use by children in the classroom, consistent with section 674(e)(3)(C) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying that providing materials in accessible formats includes changes in the depth, breadth, and complexity of materials.  Some commenters stated that Sec. 300.172 should include language regarding universal design of instructional materials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.172 is consistent with section 612(a)(23) of the Act and focuses specifically on providing access to print instructional materials using the NIMAS.  The NIMAS is designed to improve the quality and consistency of print instructional materials converted into accessible formats for persons who are blind and persons with print disabilities, not to alter the content (e.g., the depth, breadth, or complexity) of the print instructional materials.  While the NIMAS is designed to make print instructional materials more readily and easily accessible to persons who are blind and persons with print disabilities, it is not intended to provide materials that are universally designed.  Therefore, while the Department acknowledges the importance of universal design, it would be inappropriate to reference universal design in this section.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The NIMAS Development Center has been charged with examining the need for future changes in the NIMAS.  This Center, funded by the Department, is looking at a variety of issues, including the extent to which universal design features should be incorporated into future iterations of the NIMAS.  Information about the NIMAS Development Center can be found at:  http://nimas.cast.org/.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that books on tape be made available in the same manner as print materials.  Discussion:  The conversion of text to speech for digital talking books is one of the accessible formats that can be generated from a NIMAS file.  The NIMAS makes it possible for such talking books to be generated more efficiently so that children who need them will receive them more quickly than in the past.  Such audio formats will be made available for printed textbooks and related printed core materials that are written and published primarily for use in elementary school and secondary school instruction and are required by an SEA or LEA for use by children in the classroom, consistent with section 674(e)(3)(C) of the Act.  The NIMAS does not pertain to books on tape that are produced in sound studios.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters requested that the regulations specify that providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner means providing these materials at the same time they are provided to children without disabilities.  One commenter recommended defining "in a timely manner" as the start of the school year or, for children who transfer schools after the start of the school year, within 30 days of the start of the school year, regardless of whether a State chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department agrees that States should make every effort to provide children with disabilities accessible instructional materials at the same time as other children receive their instructional materials.  The Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 19, which states, "The committee feels strongly that instructional materials should be provided to blind and print disabled students at the same time their fellow students without print disabilities are receiving the same materials."  This position also is consistent with H. Rpt. No. 108-77, pp. 97-98.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have amended paragraph (b) in Sec. 300.172 by adding a new paragraph (b)(4) requiring the SEA to ensure that all public agencies take all reasonable steps to provide instructional materials in accessible formats to children with disabilities who need those instructional materials at the same time as other children receive instructional materials.  We have reorganized paragraph (c) and added a new paragraph (c)(2) requiring States that coordinate with the NIMAC to provide accessible materials in a timely manner.  We have also amended paragraph (e) by adding a new paragraph (e)(2) to clarify that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e)(1) apply to each SEA and LEA whether or not the SEA or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.  We have made technical changes to Sec. 300.172(e) and renumbered Sec. 300.172(e) to be consistent with this change.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the regulations fail to ensure timely access to instructional materials for children with other types of disabilities besides print disabilities.  One commenter recommended clarifying that children do not have to be blind or have print disabilities to fit into the description of children who need accessible materials.  However, another commenter stated that Sec. 300.172(b)(3), which require SEAs to be responsible for providing accessible materials for children for whom assistance is not available from the NIMAC, should be removed because the Act does not include these requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters requested adding a regulation to clarify that the requirements in Sec. 300.172 do not apply if an SEA is not responsible for purchasing textbooks.  The commenters stated that if an SEA cannot purchase textbooks, it has no legal relationship with textbook publishers and cannot comply with the requirements in Sec. 300.172.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Timely access to appropriate and accessible instructional materials is an inherent component of a public agency's obligation under the Act to ensure that FAPE is available for children with disabilities and that children with disabilities participate in the general curriculum as specified in their IEPs.  Section 300.172(b)(3) provides that nothing relieves an SEA of its responsibility to ensure that children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats, but who do not fall within the category of children who are eligible to receive materials produced from NIMAS files obtained through the NIMAC, receive those instructional materials in a timely manner.  Therefore, we do not believe that any further clarification is necessary.  Even SEAs that are not directly responsible for purchasing textbooks have this responsibility.  In short, we believe these regulations are necessary to fully implement the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that all children with disabilities should receive assistance from the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  Section 674(e) of the Act limits the authority of the NIMAC to provide assistance to SEAs and LEAs in acquiring instructional materials for children who are blind, have visual disabilities, or are unable to read or use standard print materials because of physical limitations, and children who have reading disabilities that result from organic dysfunction, as provided for in 36 CFR 701.6.  Clearly, SEAs and LEAs that choose to use the services of the NIMAC will be able to assist blind persons or other persons with print disabilities who need accessible instructional materials through this mechanism.  However, SEAs and LEAs still have an obligation to provide accessible instructional materials in a timely manner to other children with disabilities who also may need accessible materials even though their SEA or LEA may not receive assistance from the NIMAC, as provided in Sec. Sec. 300.172(b)(3) and 300.210(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
