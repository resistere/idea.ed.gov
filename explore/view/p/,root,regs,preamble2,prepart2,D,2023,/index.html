Specific learning disabilities (Sec. 300.307)  <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters supported proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1), which allowed States to prohibit LEAs from using a severe discrepancy between IQ and achievement (discrepancy models) to determine eligibility under the specific learning disability (SLD) category.  However, many commenters supported the use of discrepancy models and requested that the regulations allow discrepancy models to continue to be used.  Numerous commenters stated that Sec. 300.307(a)(1) exceeds statutory authority and that LEAs should be permitted to use discrepancy models.  Many commenters cited Conf. Rpt. 108-779 and stated that Congress did not intend to prohibit LEAs from using discrepancy models.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department agrees that proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1) should be removed.  We believe this will improve the clarity of the regulations and make it easier for parents and professionals to understand.  With respect to permitting LEAs to use discrepancy models, even with the removal of Sec. 300.307(a)(1), States are responsible for developing criteria to determine whether a child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8 and section 602(3) of the Act, including whether a particular child meets the criteria for having an SLD.  Under section 614(b)(6) of the Act, States are free to prohibit the use of a discrepancy model.  States, including States that did not use a discrepancy model prior to the Act, are not required to develop criteria that permit the use of a discrepancy model.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed Sec. 300.307(a)(1) and redesignated the subsequent provisions in Sec. 300.307.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters stated that response to intervention (RTI) should be considered one component of the evaluation process and not the sole component.  Another commenter stated that neither a discrepancy model nor an RTI model alone can correctly identify children with SLD and that other data are needed, such as informal and formal assessments, histories, and observations.  One commenter stated that all relevant and available evaluation data, such as the nature and type of evaluation, evaluator qualifications, and outcome data should be considered.  One commenter recommended that RTI be tied to the general evaluation procedures.  Another commenter recommended referencing the evaluation procedures in Sec. 300.309 to clarify that RTI must be used as one component of the evaluation process to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  Several commenters stated that relying solely on an RTI model would result in larger numbers of children being identified with an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consistent with Sec. 300.304(b) and section 614(b)(2) of the Act, the evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability, including an SLD, must include a variety of assessment tools and strategies and cannot rely on any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining eligibility for special education and related services.  This requirement applies to all children suspected of having a disability, including those suspected of having an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
To simplify new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) and remove unnecessary repetition, we will:  (a) remove the phrase "as part of the evaluation procedures described in Sec. 300.304;" and (b) replace "process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention" with "process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention."  Section 300.311(a)(7) will also be revised, consistent with this language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) and Sec. 300.311(a)(7) for clarity.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended changing new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) to require that State criteria "may" rather than "must" permit a process that determines if a child responds to research-based intervention in order to be consistent with section 614(b)(6)(B) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Making the requested change to new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) would be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 614(b)(6)(B) of the Act gives LEAs the option of using a process that determines if a child responds to research-based interventions.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations include a statement that discrepancy models have been discredited and that there is no evidence that they can be applied in a valid and reliable manner.  Several commenters recommended that the Department urge States, at least through guidance, to eliminate provisions under State laws that permit the use of discrepancy models.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to add language in the regulations discouraging the use of discrepancy models to identify children with SLD.  We removed current Sec. 300.541(a)(2), which required States to use a discrepancy model to determine whether a child has an SLD, because section 614(b)(6) of the Act now specifies that an LEA shall not be required to consider a severe discrepancy in determining whether a child has an SLD.  New Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) requires States to permit the use of a process that examines whether the child responds to scientific, research-based interventions as part of the information reviewed to determine whether a child has an SLD.  The regulations reflect the Department's position on the identification of children with SLD and our support for models that focus on assessments that are related to instruction and promote intervention for identified children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that any guidance the Department issues on RTI models should emphasize that RTI represents a shift in how children are identified for special education services and not just an additional task that special education teachers must do. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consensus reports and empirical syntheses indicate a need for major changes in the approach to identifying children with SLD.  Models that incorporate RTI represent a shift in special education toward goals of better achievement and improved behavioral outcomes for children with SLD because the children who are identified under such models are most likely to require special education and related services.  We will consider addressing this issue in future guidance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters stated that the elimination of discrepancy models would result in an inability to identify children with SLD who are gifted.  One commenter stated that a scatter of scores should be used to identify children with SLD who are gifted.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Discrepancy models are not essential for identifying children with SLD who are gifted.  However, the regulations clearly allow discrepancies in achievement domains, typical of children with SLD who are gifted, to be used to identify children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters opposed the use of RTI models to determine whether a child has an SLD, stating that there is a lack of scientific evidence demonstrating that RTI models correctly identify children with SLD.  One commenter stated that RTI is a subjective method of determining whether treatment is effective and is not a treatment itself.  A few commenters requested additional research demonstrating the efficacy of the wide-scale use of RTI models.  Some commenters stated that research on the use of RTI models has been conducted only in the area of reading in the primary grades and pointed to the lack of scientific data on achievement gains or long-term success.  One commenter stated that there is no evidence that RTI is effective for non-native speakers of English and minority populations.  Another commenter stated that RTI would fail to identify young children with SLD.  One commenter stated that when a child fails to respond to an intervention, it is unclear why the child failed (e.g., inappropriate intervention, ineffective teaching, unreasonable expectations).  One commenter stated that longitudinal data are needed to determine if children who succeed in an RTI process later become eligible under the category of SLD based on reading fluency and comprehension difficulties, or difficulties in other academic areas, such as mathematics problem-solving or written expression.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act requires that LEAs be permitted to use a process that determines if a child responds to research-based interventions.  Further, there is an evidence base to support the use of RTI models to identify children with SLD on a wide scale, including young children and children from minority backgrounds.  These include several large-scale implementations in Iowa (the Heartland model; Tilly, 2002); the Minneapolis public schools (Marston, 2003); applications of the Screening to Enhance Equitable Placement (STEEP) model in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arizona (VanDerHeyden, Witt, and Gilbertson, in press); and other examples (NASDE, 2005).1  While it is true that much of the research on RTI models has been conducted in the area of reading, 80 to 90 percent of children with SLD experience reading problems.  The implementation of RTI in practice, however, has included other domains.  RTI is only one component of the process to identify children in need of special education and related services.  Determining why a child has not responded to research-based interventions requires a comprehensive evaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about how LEAs will conduct evaluations for children suspected of having an SLD who attend private schools because requiring an RTI process could become entangled with the private school's instructional practices.  The commenter recommended clarifying that child find does not require an LEA to use RTI to identify children with SLD who are attending private schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation.  A public agency must use a variety of data gathering tools and strategies even if an RTI process is used.  The results of an RTI process may be one component of the information reviewed as part of the evaluation procedures required under Sec. Sec. 300.304 and 300.305.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b), consistent with section 614(b)(2) of the Act, an evaluation must include a variety of assessment tools and strategies and cannot rely on any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining eligibility for special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that adoption of new procedures for evaluating children suspected of having an SLD should not penalize or declassify children who under prior procedures were found to have an SLD.  The commenter recommended using the requirements in Sec. 300.305, rather than data from a child's response to a scientific, research-based intervention process, to consider whether a child continues to have an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The results of an RTI process may be one component of the information reviewed as part of the reevaluation process.  It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child continues to have a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
States that change their eligibility criteria for SLD may want to carefully consider the reevaluation of children found eligible for special education services using prior procedures.  States should consider the effect of exiting a child from special education who has received special education and related services for many years and how the removal of such supports will affect the child's educational progress, particularly for a child who is in the final year(s) of high school.  Obviously, the group should consider whether the child's instruction and overall special education program have been appropriate as part of this process.  If the special education instruction has been appropriate and the child has not been able to exit special education, this would be strong evidence that the child's eligibility needs to be maintained.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
