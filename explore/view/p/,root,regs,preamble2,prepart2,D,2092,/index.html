Determining the existence of a specific learning disability (Sec. 300.309)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that there is no authority in the Act for the SLD eligibility requirements outlined in Sec. 300.309.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the statutory language is broad and does not include the specific requirements to determine whether a child suspected of having an SLD is a child with a disability.  The purpose of these regulations, however, is to provide details to assist States in the appropriate implementation of the Act.  We believe the requirements in Sec. 300.309 are necessary to ensure that States have the details necessary to implement the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that RTI was Congress' preference for determining eligibility under SLD, and therefore, the criteria for RTI should be the first paragraph of Sec. 300.309 (Determining the existence of a specific learning disability).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department believes that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 are presented in a logical order and are consistent with the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that a discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement can differentiate between children with disabilities and children with general low achievement, and noted that the problems with discrepancy models have been in implementation, rather than in the concept itself for identifying children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is a substantial research base summarized in several recent consensus reports (Donovan and Cross, 2002; Bradley et al., 2003) and meta-analyses (Hoskyn and Swanson, 2000; Steubing et al., 2002) that does not support the hypothesis that a discrepancy model by itself can differentiate children with disabilities and children with general low achievement.2  Therefore, we disagree with the comment because such a differentiation is not possible with any single criterion, including RTI.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested retaining the language in current Sec. 300.541, regarding the use of discrepancy models. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(b)(6) of the Act prohibits States from requiring a discrepancy approach to identify children with SLD.  Current Sec. 300.541 requires a discrepancy determination and is, therefore, inconsistent with the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the eligibility group be allowed to consider the results from standardized, individualized testing (not just criterion-based testing or functional assessments) in the eligibility determination.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Nothing in the Act or these regulations would preclude the eligibility group from considering results from standardized tests when making eligibility determinations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended adding the concept of psychological processing disorders to the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.  Several commenters noted that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not fully address the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), which includes a processing disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes.  Several commenters stated that, without requiring documentation of a basic psychological processing disorder, the number of children identified with SLD will significantly increase and the use of assessment tools that have the potential to significantly guide instruction will decrease.  Several commenters stated that failure to consider individual differences in cognitive processing skills reverses more than 20 years of progress in cognitive psychology and developmental neuroscience.  One commenter stated that identifying a basic psychological processing disorder would help ensure that children identified with an SLD are not simply victims of poor instruction.  One commenter stated that the shift away from requiring diagnostic assessments in the area of cognition would make it conceptually impossible to document that a child has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes, as required in the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department does not believe that an assessment of psychological or cognitive processing should be required in determining whether a child has an SLD.  There is no current evidence that such assessments are necessary or sufficient for identifying SLD.  Further, in many cases, these assessments have not been used to make appropriate intervention decisions.  However, Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits, but does not require, consideration of a pattern of strengths or weaknesses, or both, relative to intellectual development, if the evaluation group considers that information relevant to an identification of SLD.  In many cases, though, assessments of cognitive processes simply add to the testing burden and do not contribute to interventions.  As summarized in the research consensus from the OSEP Learning Disability Summit (Bradley, Danielson, and Hallahan, 2002), "Although processing deficits have been linked to some SLD (e.g., phonological processing and reading), direct links with other processes have not been established.  Currently, available methods for measuring many processing difficulties are inadequate.  Therefore, systematically measuring processing difficulties and their link to treatment is not yet feasible....Processing deficits should be eliminated from the criteria for classification...." (p. 797).3  Concerns about the absence of evidence for relations of cognitive discrepancy and SLD for identification go back to Bijou (1942;4 see Kavale, 2002)5.  Cronbach (1957)6 characterized the search for aptitude by treatment interactions as a "hall of mirrors," a situation that has not improved over the past few years as different approaches to assessment of cognitive processes have emerged (Fletcher et al., 2005; Reschly and Tilly, 1999)7.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested that the regulations include a definition of "intellectual development."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to define "intellectual development" in these regulations.  Intellectual development is included in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) as one of three standards of comparison, along with age and State-approved grade-level standards.  The reference to "intellectual development" in this provision means that the child exhibits a pattern on strengths and weaknesses in performance relative to a standard of intellectual development such as commonly measured by IQ tests.  Use of the term is consistent with the discretion provided in the Act in allowing the continued use of discrepancy models. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that intra-individual differences, particularly in cognitive functions, are essential to identifying a child with an SLD and should be included in the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As indicated above, an assessment of intra-individual differences in cognitive functions does not contribute to identification and intervention decisions for children suspected of having an SLD.  The regulations, however, allow for the assessment of intra-individual differences in achievement as part of an identification model for SLD.  The regulations also allow for the assessment of discrepancies in intellectual development and achievement. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested guidance on how to determine whether a child was provided with learning experiences appropriate for the child's age, as required in Sec. 300.309(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While such guidance might be helpful, we believe SEAs and LEAs are in the best position to provide guidance on age-appropriate learning experiences. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed support for the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and stated that the first element of determining eligibility for an SLD is a finding that the child does not achieve commensurate with the child's age in one or more of the eight areas when provided with learning experiences appropriate to the child's age.  However, several commenters requested requiring that eligibility determinations for an SLD include evidence that the child's achievement level is not commensurate with the child's age and ability (emphasis added).  One commenter indicated that knowledge of a child's ability level is important to ensure that a determination is not based on deficits in areas not related to cognitive processing (e.g., lack of opportunity to learn, social or emotional disturbances), and to prevent misdiagnosis of children with mental retardation and SLD.  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.309(a)(1) would allow any child who failed to achieve commensurate with his or her age to be considered to have an SLD, and this will increase the number of children referred for special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters expressed concern that the eligibility determination for SLD is based on whether the child achieves commensurate with his or her age because current practice uses normative data that are based on grade level.  These commenters recommended clarifying that grade level or classmate performance should also be considered.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The first element in identifying a child with SLD should be a child's mastery of grade-level content appropriate for the child's age or in relation to State-approved grade-level standards, not abilities.  This emphasis is consistent with the focus in the ESEA on the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards for all children.  State-approved standards are not expressed as "norms" but represent benchmarks for all children at each grade level.  The performance of classmates and peers is not an appropriate standard if most children in a class or school are not meeting State-approved standards.  Furthermore, using grade-based normative data to make this determination is generally not appropriate for children who have not been permitted to progress to the next academic grade or are otherwise older than their peers.  Such a practice may give the illusion of average rates of learning when the child's rate of learning has been below average, resulting in retention.  A focus on expectations relative to abilities or classmates simply dilutes expectations for children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We will modify Sec. 300.309(a)(1) to clarify that, as a first element in determining whether a child has an SLD, the group must determine that the child does not demonstrate achievement that is adequate for the child's age or the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas listed in Sec. 300.309(a)(1).  The reference to "State-approved grade-level standards" is intended to emphasize the alignment of the Act and the ESEA, as well as to cover children who have been retained in a grade, since age level expectations may not be appropriate for these children.  The reference to "instruction" will be added to emphasize that children may not be identified as having SLD if there is no documentation of appropriate instruction, consistent with the Act and the ESEA.  Consistent with this change, we will add a reference to "State-approved grade-level standards" in Sec. Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii).  We will also combine proposed Sec. 300.311(a)(5) and (6) into Sec. 300.311(a)(5) to ensure consistency with the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have modified Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and Sec. Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii), and combined proposed Sec. 300.311(a)(5) and (6) into Sec. 300.311(a)(5) to ensure consistency with the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed support for including reading fluency in the list of areas to be considered when determining whether a child has an SLD.  However, several commenters recommended removing reading fluency from the list in Sec. 300.309(a)(1), stating that a weakness in reading fluency, in isolation, does not indicate a reading disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  No assessment, in isolation, is sufficient to indicate that a child has an SLD.  Including reading fluency in the list of areas to be considered when determining whether a child has an SLD makes it more likely that a child who is gifted and has an SLD would be identified.  Fluency assessments are very brief and highly relevant to instruction.  We, therefore, do not believe that reading fluency should be removed from Sec. 300.309(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters stated that eligibility criteria based on RTI models will result in dramatic increases in referrals, special education placements, and legal problems.  One commenter stated that the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not provide sufficient checks and balances to ensure that only those children who truly require special education are identified as having SLD.  A few commenters stated that using an RTI model would result in incorrectly identifying underachieving children as having SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that eligibility criteria based on RTI models will result in dramatic increases in referrals and special education placements.  Well-implemented RTI models and models that identify problems early and promote intervention have reduced, not increased, the number of children identified as eligible for special education services and have helped raise achievement levels for all children in a school8.  We believe that the regulations do provide sufficient checks to ensure that only children who need special education and related services are identified as having SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that the language in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) is very confusing and should be rewritten.  Many commenters stated that the word "or" instead of "and" should be used between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii), because otherwise a child could be identified with an SLD because he or she failed to meet passing criteria on a State assessment, and failure to make sufficient progress on a State-approved assessment alone is not grounds for a determination that a child has an SLD.  Several commenters stated that the phrase, "pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both" is a typographical error because it is repeated twice.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that "and" should be used instead of "or" between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii), because this would subject the child to two different identification models.  We agree that failing a State assessment alone is not sufficient to determine whether a child has an SLD.  However, failing a State assessment may be one factor in an evaluation considered by the eligibility group.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the evaluation must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant information about the child.  Further, Sec. 300.304(b)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act, is clear that determining eligibility for special education and related services cannot be based on any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree that Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) could be stated more clearly and will rewrite it to state that the eligibility group can determine that a child has an SLD if the child meets the criteria in Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age and State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) for clarity. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested a definition of "State-approved results."  One commenter stated that the language was extremely confusing and that "State-approved results" could be interpreted to mean approved results that are equivalent to proficiency on State assessments under the ESEA, and this could lead to eligibility determinations for a very large group of older children with poor reading performance for whom it would be nearly impossible to make sufficient progress to become proficient readers.  This commenter recommended changing the language to refer to a child's failure to achieve a rate of learning to make sufficient progress based on "State-defined criteria."  Another commenter recommended substituting "State achievement standards" for "State approved results."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The intention is to refer to State assessments approved under the ESEA.  We have changed "State-approved results" to "State-approved grade-level standards."  We believe this change adequately addresses the commenters concerns.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed "State-approved results" and inserted in its place "State-approved grade-level standards" in Sec. 300.309 and Sec. 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that including "State-approved results" in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) means that there is no Federal definition of SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  States must develop criteria for determining whether a child has an SLD that are consistent with the Federal requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.311 and the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that using the criteria in Sec. 300.309(a)(2), a child could meet State standards and still be identified as a child with an SLD. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters.  Accelerated growth toward, and mastery of, State-approved grade-level standards are goals of special education.  Furthermore, as stated in Sec. 300.101, the fact that a child is advancing from grade to grade does not make a child with a disability ineligible for special education and related services.  However, consistent with Sec. 300.8, the group making the eligibility determination must conclude both that the child has an SLD and, that, because of that disability, the child needs special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested more detail and specific guidelines on RTI models, such as information on who initiates the RTI process and who should be involved in the process; how one ensures there is a strong leader for the RTI process; the skills needed to implement RTI models; the role of the general education teacher; how to determine that a child is not responsive to instruction, particularly a child with cultural and linguistic differences; the number of different types of interventions to be tried; the responsibility for monitoring progress; the measurement of treatment integrity; and ways to document progress.  One commenter stated that it is imperative that the regulations allow the flexibility necessary to accommodate the array of RTI models already in use.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters requested that the Department define and set a standard for responsiveness that calls for demonstrated progress and improvement in the rate of learning, to indicate that a child can function in the classroom.  Several commenters stated that there would be a dramatic increase in the number of children identified with an SLD without a clearly defined system in place.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There are many RTI models and the regulations are written to accommodate the many different models that are currently in use.  The Department does not mandate or endorse any particular model.  Rather, the regulations provide States with the flexibility to adopt criteria that best meet local needs.  Language that is more specific or prescriptive would not be appropriate.  For example, while we recognize that rate of learning is often a key variable in assessing a child's response to intervention, it would not be appropriate for the regulations to set a standard for responsiveness or improvement in the rate of learning. As we discussed earlier in this section, we do not believe these regulations will result in significant increases in the number of children identified with SLD. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that, without additional clarity, eligibility criteria will vary substantially among States and that States will have definitions that are suited to their individual preferences, rather than a universal sense of what constitutes eligibility under SLD based on the research and national standards of professional practice.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  State eligibility criteria must meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.111 and LEAs must use these State-adopted criteria.  We believe that, although these provisions allow States some flexibility in how children with SLD are identified, the requirements in these provisions will ensure that SLD criteria do not vary substantially across States. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department agrees that it is important to identify children with SLD early and to provide the necessary instruction and supports to avoid referrals to special education.  The extent to which States involve other interested parties (e.g., disability groups, parent groups) in the design or development of such a system is a decision that should be made by each State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that professional development requirements to implement RTI models should be incorporated into the regulations so RTI models are not haphazardly implemented.  One commenter stated that before RTI can be used systematically as part of the special education identification process, school districts must have administrative support at all levels, ongoing professional development for all staff, and coordination with institutions of higher education.  Several commenters recommended encouraging States to develop efficient, collaborative evaluation systems.  One commenter recommended requiring regular education teachers to address the needs of children with different learning styles, identify early and appropriate interventions for children with behavioral challenges, and understand and use data and assessments to improve classroom practices and learning.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that administrative support, professional development, and coordination with teacher training programs would be helpful in the effective implementation of RTI models.  We also agree that efficient and collaborative evaluation systems should be developed, and that all teachers, including regular education teachers, should be trained to address the needs of children with different learning styles, identify early and appropriate interventions for children with behavioral challenges, and understand and use data and assessments to improve classroom practices and learning.  However, professional development requirements are a State responsibility, consistent with Sec. 300.156 and section 612(a)(14) of the Act, and it would be inappropriate for the Department to include specific professional development requirements in these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that if a State prohibits the use of a discrepancy model, there would not be sufficient time or funds necessary to effectively train staff.  Several commenters asked that there be a transition period so that personnel can be adequately trained in RTI or other forms of assessment and observation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary for these regulations to require a transition period for implementing RTI models, particularly because there are many schools and districts currently implementing RTI models.  Under the requirements in section 614(b)(6) of the Act, which took effect July 1, 2005, States should have developed mechanisms to permit LEAs to use RTI models.  States may need to make adjustments based on these final regulations.  Nothing in these regulations requires an LEA to drop current practices in favor of a new model with no transition.  Obviously, a plan would need to be developed when changing to an RTI model, including strategies for implementation and professional development.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters stated that the use of RTI models would be costly, requiring massive staff training and resources.  Many commenters recommended ways in which the Department could support States in improving identification and interventions for children with SLD.  Commenters' recommendations included the following:  long-term, Statewide pilot studies on assessments and interventions for children with SLD; methods to increase the use of RTI; guidance on establishing appropriate timelines for instructional interventions; and information on new scientifically based approaches to identifying children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department recognizes the need for technical assistance and training to implement RTI models and is directing technical assistance funds under Part D of the Act, administered by the Department's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), toward this effort.  OSEP plans to develop and disseminate an RTI resource kit and devote additional resources to technical assistance providers to assist States in implementing RTI models.  OSEP will also continue to identify and develop model RTI implementation sites and evaluate SLD identification models in math and reading.  In addition, the Comprehensive Center on Instruction, jointly funded by OSEP and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), will provide technical assistance to States on RTI implementation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters supported examining the pattern of strengths and weaknesses in determining whether a child is considered to have an SLD.  A number of commenters stated that it is important that groups use a process to determine whether a child responds to scientific, research-based interventions, as well as consider relevant, empirically validated patterns of strengths and weaknesses in achievement, performance, or both, relative to intellectual development.  One commenter stated that "pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance" in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) is insufficiently defined and without a clearer definition of "pattern," schools will continue the wait-to-fail model.  One commenter recommended clarifying the meaning of "weakness," stating that weakness does not mean failure, and that there may be specific actions that could address weaknesses in performance that would result in failure if left alone.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Patterns of strengths and weaknesses commonly refer to the examination of profiles across different tests used historically in the identification of children with SLD.  We believe that the meaning of "pattern of strengths and weaknesses" is clear and does not need to be clarified in these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters stated that using a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in a child's performance to identify a child with an SLD could be misinterpreted to identify children, other than children with disabilities, who are underperforming due to cultural factors, environmental or economic disadvantage, or low effort.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.309(a)(3) is clear that children should not be identified with SLD if the underachievement is primarily the result of a visual, hearing, or motor disability; mental retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors; or environmental or economic disadvantage.  The eligibility group makes the determination after the evaluation of the child is completed.  Therefore, we believe that there is minimal risk that a child who is underachieving due to these factors will be identified as having an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended using "cognitive ability" in place of "intellectual development" because "intellectual development" could be narrowly interpreted to mean performance on an IQ test.  One commenter stated that the term "cognitive ability" is preferable because it reflects the fundamental concepts underlying SLD and can be assessed with a variety of appropriate assessment tools.  A few commenters stated that the reference to identifying a child's pattern of strengths and weaknesses that are not related to intellectual development should be removed because a cognitive assessment is critical and should always be used to make a determination under the category of SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the term "intellectual development" is the appropriate reference in this provision.  Section 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits the assessment of patterns of strengths and weakness in performance, including performance on assessments of cognitive ability.  As stated previously, "intellectual development" is included as one of three methods of comparison, along with age and State-approved grade-level standards.  The term "cognitive" is not the appropriate reference to performance because cognitive variation is not a reliable marker of SLD, and is not related to intervention.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter reviewed the list of factors in Sec. 300.309(a)(3) that must be ruled out as primary reasons for a child's performance and asked whether children with other health impairments (OHI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or speech impairments would overlap with the SLD definition.  Several commenters noted that many children with hearing, visual, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; or emotional disturbances (ED) also have concomitant learning disabilities that go unidentified, and that these children end up with lower academic and functional achievement levels than they should because an important contributing factor to their learning problems has not been addressed.  Several commenters recommended adding language to the regulations stating that a child with a disability other than an SLD may also be identified with an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Children with one of the disabilities in Sec. 300.8 should be identified as a child with a disability using the category that is most appropriate for the child.  Some children may be identified under other disability categories, such as OHI, TBI, ED, or speech impairment, and may also have low achievement and even meet SLD criteria.  Services must meet the child's needs and cannot be determined by the child's eligibility category.  We believe it is unnecessary to add language regarding SLD as a concomitant disability. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked what kind of assessment identifies culture as a primary cause of academic performance deficits and recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.309(a)(3)(iv) unless there are objective methods to determine whether a child's low performance is a result of cultural factors.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The identification of the effect of cultural factors on a child's performance is a judgment made by the eligibility group based on multiple sources of information, including the home environment, language proficiency, and other contextual factors gathered in the evaluation.  The Department believes that the identification of children with SLD will improve with models based on systematic assessments of a child's response to appropriate instruction, the results of which are one part of the information reviewed during the evaluation process to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  States and public agencies must follow the evaluation procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.304 and 300.305 and section 614(b) of the Act, including using assessments and other evaluation materials that do not discriminate on a racial or cultural basis, consistent with Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(i) and section 614(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that limited English proficiency be among the factors that the eligibility group must rule out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.306(b)(1)(iii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(C) of the Act, is clear that a child must not be identified as a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is limited English proficiency.  However, we agree that it is important to re-emphasize this requirement in Sec. 300.309 and will add this to the list of factors that the eligibility group must rule out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (vi) to Sec. 300.309(a)(3) to include "limited English proficiency" in the list of factors that must be ruled out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance before determining that a child is eligible for special education services under the category of SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters supported the requirement in Sec. 300.309(b)(1) for data demonstrating that a child suspected of having an SLD has been provided with high-quality, research-based instruction in regular education settings delivered by qualified personnel.  Several commenters stated that this requirement should apply to all children and asked why this requirement is confined to only children suspected of having SLD.  One commenter stated that if schools would use proven best practices, there would be fewer children in need of special education in the later grades.  However, one commenter stated that it is incorrect to assume that any child who is not responding to interventions must have an SLD when there are a myriad of reasons why children may not be responding to instruction.  One commenter recommended adding "to the extent practicable" to acknowledge that scientific research-based interventions are not available in many areas, particularly in mathematics.  One commenter recommended decreasing the emphasis on research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Sections 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, specifically state that children should not be identified for special education if the achievement problem is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or mathematics.  This issue is especially relevant to SLD because lack of appropriate instruction in these areas most commonly leads to identifying a child as having an SLD.  All children should be provided with appropriate instruction provided by qualified personnel.  This is an important tenet of the Act and the ESEA.  Both the Act and the ESEA focus on doing what works as evidenced by scientific research and providing children with appropriate instruction delivered by qualified teachers.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  We received a number of comments concerning the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction provided by qualified personnel.  One commenter stated that it would be difficult for rural school districts to meet this requirement because of staffing requirements in the regular education setting.  Several commenters stated that the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority and should be removed, because it provides a basis for challenging any determination under the category of SLD.  One commenter asked for clarification regarding the legal basis for providing high-quality, research-based instruction if the child is not determined eligible for special education.  Another commenter stated that attorneys will read Sec. 300.309(b) as providing a legal entitlement to ESEA, research-based instruction and data-based documentation for every child considered for eligibility under the category of SLD, and that when this standard is not met, will bring the matter to a due process hearing and request compensatory education. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerous commenters requested a definition of high-quality, research-based instruction.  One commenter asked who validates that the research meets the highest quality.  Another commenter asked that the regulations specify how much research a program must undergo before it is deemed to be research-based.  One commenter stated that the Department must address how States determine whether a child has been provided with a high-quality, research-based instructional program; whether appropriate classroom interventions were delivered; and whether an intervention has been successful.  One commenter stated that the absence of additional clarification would result in great disparity in States' policies and lead to inappropriate interventions and procedures.  One commenter recommended that there be evidence that the instruction is effective for the child's age and cultural background.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended that children who are not progressing because they have not received research-based instruction by a qualified teacher should immediately receive intensive, high-quality, research-based instruction by qualified personnel.  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.309(b) restricts referrals to only those children who have received high-quality, research-based instruction from qualified teachers.  One commenter stated that a child's eligibility to receive special education services under the category of SLD appears to be contingent on the LEA's commitment to providing effective regular education services by qualified staff, and, as such, a child with an SLD is held hostage by a system that is not working.  One commenter asked whether the eligibility group can make a determination that a child has an SLD in the absence of a child's response to high-quality research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that the lack of research-based instruction by a qualified teacher should not limit a child's eligibility for services.  Another commenter recommended clarifying that a child should not be found ineligible under the category of SLD because the child either did not respond to a scientific, research-based intervention during a truncated evaluation, or because the child was not provided an opportunity to respond to such an intervention.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Watering down a focus on appropriate instruction for any children, including children with disabilities or children living in rural areas would be counter to both the Act and the ESEA.  However, we agree that the requirement for high quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority.  The Act indicates that children should not be eligible for special education if the low achievement is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  Therefore, we will change the regulations to require that the eligibility group consider evidence that the child was provided appropriate instruction and clarify that this means evidence that lack of appropriate instruction was the source of underachievement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The eligibility group should not identify a child as eligible for special education services if the child's low achievement is the result of lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  Eligibility is contingent on the ability of the LEA to provide appropriate instruction.  Determining the basis of low achievement when a child has been given appropriate instruction is the responsibility of the eligibility group.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Whether a child has received "appropriate instruction" is appropriately left to State and local officials to determine.  Schools should have current, data-based evidence to indicate whether a child responds to appropriate instruction before determining that a child is a child with a disability.  Children should not be identified as having a disability before concluding that their performance deficits are not the result of a lack of appropriate instruction.  Parents of children with disabilities have due process rights that allow them to file a complaint on any matter that relates to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of their child with a disability, and the provision of FAPE to their child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised the introductory material in Sec. 300.309(b) to emphasize that the purpose of the review is to rule out a lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math as the reason for a child's underachievement.  We have also revised Sec. 300.309(b)(1) to refer to appropriate instruction rather than high-quality, research-based instruction, and removed the cross reference to the ESEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that many reading programs claim to be research-based, but lack credible evidence of the program's effectiveness.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Programs that claim to be research-based, but which are not based on sound scientific research, should not be considered research-based instruction by a State or LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked what criteria should be used to determine that the child was provided with appropriate high quality, research-based instruction, especially when the child has been home schooled or attends a private school.  One commenter asked about children referred for evaluation from charter schools and expressed concern that these children would not be eligible under the category of SLD because they did not have instruction delivered by qualified personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As part of the evaluation, the eligibility group must consider whether the child received appropriate instruction from qualified personnel.  For children who attend private schools or charter schools or who are home-schooled, it may be necessary to obtain information from parents and teachers about the curricula used and the child's progress with various teaching strategies.  The eligibility group also may need to use information from current classroom-based assessments or classroom observations.  On the basis of the available information, the eligibility group may identify other information that is needed to determine whether the child's low achievement is due to a disability, and not primarily the result of lack of appropriate instruction.  The requirements for special education eligibility or the expectations for the quality of teachers or instructional programs are not affected, and do not differ, by the location or venue of a child's instruction. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested a definition of "qualified personnel."  One commenter stated that teachers should be trained to deliver the program of instruction and simply saying they should be highly qualified is not sufficient.  One commenter recommended removing the phrase "qualified personnel" in Sec. 300.309(b)(1), because it is likely to be interpreted to mean that instruction must be delivered by highly qualified teachers, as defined in the ESEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.156 and section 614(a)(14) of the Act are clear that each State is responsible for establishing and maintaining personnel qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including that those personnel have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  Consistent with Sec. 300.18 and section 602(10) of the Act, a public school teacher, including a special education teacher, who teaches core academic subjects must meet the highly qualified teacher standards under the Act.  The term that is used in Sec. 300.309(b)(1), "qualified personnel," does not, and should not be interpreted to, require that private school teachers be "highly qualified" to deliver the instruction discussed in Sec. 300.309(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether the regulations require an LEA to provide high-quality, research-based instruction in the regular education setting prior to, or as part of, the referral process before the group can determine whether a child has an SLD.  One commenter recommended that research-based interventions occur prior to a referral to special education.  Several commenters stated that an evaluation to assess all areas of suspected disability should follow an assessment of a child's response to instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  What is important is that the group making the eligibility decision has the information that it needs to rule out that the child's underachievement is a result of a lack of appropriate instruction.  That could include evidence that the child was provided appropriate instruction either before, or as a part of, the referral process.  Evidence of appropriate instruction, including instruction delivered in an RTI model, is not a substitute for a complete assessment of all of the areas of suspected need.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended reinforcing the role of parents in determining whether a child has an SLD by adding language to Sec. 300.309(b) stating that the child's parents and the group of qualified professionals must consider whether the child is a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4)(A) of the Act, is clear that the parent of the child is included in eligibility determinations.

Discussion:  Data-based documentation refers to an objective and systematic process of documenting a child's progress.  This type of assessment is a feature of strong instruction in reading and math and is consistent with Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii) and section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, that children cannot be identified for special education if an achievement problem is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters supported requiring data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals to be provided to parents during the time the child is receiving instruction.  One commenter emphasized the importance of documenting that the interventions used are data based and implemented with fidelity.  One commenter stated that data-based documentation should be provided to all parents of children with disabilities, not just children suspected of having SLD.  However, several commenters stated that requiring data-based documentation of repeated assessments is an additional bureaucratic requirement that is overly prescriptive and costly, and will require additional paperwork.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that one of the most important aspects of good teaching is the ability to determine when a child is learning and then to tailor instruction to meet the child's individual needs.  Effective teachers use data to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of a particular instructional strategy or program.  A critical hallmark of appropriate instruction is that data documenting a child's progress are systematically collected and analyzed and that parents are kept informed of the child's progress.  Assessments of a child's progress are not bureaucratic, but an essential component of good instruction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended removing the requirement for data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals because it would make it impossible to determine eligibility if a child is new to a school district and district personnel do not have a child's records with such information.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe removing the requirement is the appropriate solution to the commenter's problem.  States will need to adopt criteria for determining how to provide such data for children new to a district.  Children should not be identified as having SLD if there is no evidence of appropriate instruction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.309(b)(2), requiring parents to be informed of their child's repeated failure to perform well on assessments, could be interpreted to refer to the assessments under the ESEA and that this would mean that a child must perform poorly over a period of several school years to be considered for eligibility under the category of SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While the results of a child's performance on assessments under the ESEA may be included as data documenting a child's progress, relying exclusively on data from Statewide assessments under the ESEA would likely not meet the requirement for repeated assessments at "reasonable intervals," as required by these regulations.  It is possible that a State could develop other assessments tied to the State approved test that would meet these requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters asked how long an intervention should continue before determining a child has not made adequate progress and a referral for an evaluation to determine eligibility for special education is made.  Several commenters recommended that if a child is not making progress within 45 days, an evaluation should take place.  Other commenters recommended a time limit of 90 days.  One commenter recommended the regulations include a range of active intervention days, not just a waiting period, within which the IEP Team expects to notice a change, and recommended between 45-75 school days.  One commenter suggested 6-10 weeks as an appropriate period of time.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended requiring States to establish reasonable time limits for decision making.  Several commenters recommended requiring the IEP Team and the parents to agree on an appropriate period of time.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that unless a timeline is specified in the regulations, there would be different standards occurring throughout the country.  A few commenters expressed concern that if time limits were not clarified, school districts and parents would interpret the timelines differently, which would result in contentious situations and litigation.  One commenter stated that a parent could sue for compensatory services if, after requesting an evaluation, the LEA requires an assessment of how the child responds to high quality research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that the lack of a specific timeline means that an evaluation could be indefinitely delayed and children denied services.  Several commenters recommended adding language to the regulations to ensure that RTI models could not be used to delay an evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability, access to special education and related services, or protections under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition to requesting a definition of an "appropriate period of time," a few commenters requested a definition of "adequate progress" and recommended adding language to require States to define "adequate progress."  One commenter stated that a child's rate of learning needs to be examined carefully.  One commenter offered a definition of a "developmentally appropriate rate" as the time or the number of repetitions required to have at least 85 percent of children at the same age or grade level acquire and retain the particular skill or academic levels, as established by research or by experience with the delivery of that curriculum or program. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Instructional models vary in terms of the length of time required for the intervention to have the intended effect on a child's progress.  It would not be appropriate for the Department to establish timelines or the other requirements proposed by the commenters in Federal regulations, because doing so would make it difficult for LEAs to implement models specific to their local school districts.  These decisions are best left to State and local professionals who have knowledge of the instructional methods used in their schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Department believes that good instruction depends on repeated assessments of a child's progress.  This allows teachers to make informed decisions about the need to change their instruction to meet the needs of the child, and also provides parents with information about their child's progress so that they can support instruction and learning at home.  Parents should be informed if there are concerns about their child's progress and should be aware of the strategies being used to improve and monitor their child's progress.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We understand the commenters' requests for more specific details on timelines and measures of adequate progress.  However, as noted above, these decisions are best left to professionals who have knowledge about the instructional models and strategies used in their States and districts.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also understand the commenters' concerns that the requirements in Sec. 300.309(b) may result in untimely evaluations or services and that parents must be fully informed about the school's concerns about their child's progress and interventions provided by the school.  Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We will also add a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to ensure that the parents of a child suspected of having an SLD who has participated in a process that evaluates the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, are notified about the State's policies regarding collection of child performance data and the general education services that will be provided; strategies to increase their child's rate of learning; and their right to request an evaluation at any time.  If parents request an evaluation and provide consent, the timeframe for evaluation begins and the information required in Sec. 300.309(b) must be collected (if it does not already exist) before the end of that period.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have combined proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revised the new paragraph (c) in Sec. 300.309 to require the public agency to promptly request parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided appropriate instruction, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We also have added a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to require that the eligibility report include evidence that when a child has participated in an RTI process, the parents were informed of State policies regarding child performance data that would be collected and the general education services that would be provided; strategies to support the child's rate of learning; and a parent's right to request an evaluation at any time.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended clarifying when parental consent for evaluation should be obtained and when the 60-day timeline to complete an evaluation begins.  Several commenters recommended ensuring that the 60-day timeline for evaluation applies regardless of the evaluation model used.  One commenter asked how scientific research-based interventions could be completed within a 60-day evaluation timeline.  One commenter stated that 60 days may not be enough time to appropriately determine whether a child responds to instruction, particularly for children who have not had exposure to such interventions (e.g., children entering the public school system for the first time).  One commenter asked if the intent of the regulations is to allow a determination that a child has an SLD to take place outside the timeline for an initial evaluation, and stated that without clarification of the intersection between an RTI process (that may, by definition, require additional time beyond that which is permitted for an evaluation) and the required period of time for an initial assessment, the regulations would cause confusion and result in improper evaluations and eligibility determinations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters recommended that the regulations address the need for an extension of the timeline and allow States to set an alternative timeline without a written agreement.  Several commenters requested adding a provision for an extended timeline, with parental consent, in exceptional circumstances.  Several commenters stated that the language regarding an extension of timelines is confusing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.309(c), as revised, clarifies that if a child has not made adequate progress after an appropriate period of time, a referral for an evaluation must be made.  As required in Sec. 300.301(c), the initial evaluation must be conducted within 60 days of receiving consent for an evaluation (or if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be completed, within that timeframe).  Models based on RTI typically evaluate the child's response to instruction prior to the onset of the 60-day period, and generally do not require as long a time to complete an evaluation because of the amount of data already collected on the child's achievement, including observation data.  RTI models provide the data the group must consider on the child's progress when provided with appropriate instruction by qualified professionals as part of the evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.309(b)(1) requires that the eligibility group consider data on the child's progress when provided with appropriate instruction by qualified professionals as part of this evaluation.  These data, along with other relevant information, will assist the eligibility group in determining whether the child's low achievement is attributable to a lack of appropriate instruction.  As required in Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, a child cannot be identified as a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Based on their review of the existing data, and input from the child's parents, the eligibility group must decide, on a case-by-case basis, depending on the needs of the child and the information available regarding the child, what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  If the eligibility group determines that additional data are needed and that these data cannot be obtained within the 60-day timeframe (or the timeframe established by the State), new Sec. 300.309(c) (proposed Sec. 300.309(d)) allows the extension of the timeframe with mutual written agreement of the child's parent and the eligibility group.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked how the 60-day timeframe would be followed if the time extends over school breaks.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The 60-day timeframe refers to 60 calendar days and would include school breaks.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that the regulations appear to set up a separate process and procedure for the evaluation and identification of children with SLD, and then impose the timeframe and procedures that apply to the evaluation of all other disability categories.  One commenter stated that the timeframe for evaluating children with SLD is less stringent than for other disability categories and is, therefore, discriminatory.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Although there are additional criteria and procedures for evaluating and identifying children suspected of having SLD, the group must also comply with the procedures and timelines that apply to all evaluations, including evaluations for SLD.  Evaluation of children suspected of having SLD must follow the same procedures and timeframes required in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.306, in addition to those in Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that "appropriate period of time" should be replaced with "reasonable period of time" because courts are accustomed to deciding what constitutes a reasonable timeframe in various evaluation contexts. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to change "appropriate period of time" to "reasonable period of time," because the terms here have similar meanings and are commonly understood to be synonymous.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify who should refer a child for an evaluation to determine eligibility for special education services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under Sec. 300.301(b), and consistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.300 and section 614(a)(1)(D) of the Act, either a parent of a child or a public agency may initiate a request for an evaluation at any time to determine if the child is a child with a disability.  We do not believe that further clarification is necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that a school district should retain its discretion not to evaluate a child subject to the parent's right to contest the decision through due process procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter's concern is already addressed in Sec. 300.111, which provides that an LEA must identify, locate, and evaluate children who are in need of special education and related services.  If an LEA refuses to evaluate a child, the LEA must provide prior written notice, consistent with Sec. 300.503 and section 615(b)(3) of the Act.  The parent can challenge this decision through a due process hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
