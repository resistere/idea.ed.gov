Transition services participants (Sec. 300.321(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring the public agency to invite the child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting no later than age 16 or at least two years prior to the child's expected graduation, whichever comes first. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concerns are addressed in Sec. 300.321(b), which requires the public agency to invite a child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching the child's postsecondary goals.  Furthermore, a child's IEP must include transition services beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger, if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, consistent with Sec. 300.320(b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that parents and children are not required to use the transition services offered by agencies that the school invites to the IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires a parent or child to participate in transition services that are offered by agencies that the public agency has invited to participate in an IEP Team meeting.  However, if the IEP Team determines that such services are necessary to meet the needs of the child, and the services are included on the child's IEP, and the parent (or a child who has reached the age of majority) disagrees with the services, the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) can request mediation, file a due process complaint, or file a State complaint to resolve the issue.  We do not believe further clarification in the regulations is necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring the public agency to include all the notice requirements in Sec. 300.322(b) with the invitation to a child to attend his or her IEP Team meeting.  The commenters stated that children need to be fully informed about the details and purpose of the meeting in order for them to adequately prepare and, therefore, should have the same information that is provided to other members of the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We decline to make the suggested change.  We believe it would be overly burdensome to require a public agency to include all the notice requirements in Sec. 300.322(b) with an invitation to a child to attend his or her IEP Team meeting, particularly because the information is provided to the child's parents who can easily share this information with the child.  However, when a child with a disability reaches the age of majority under State law, the public agency must provide any notice required by the Act to both the child and the parents, consistent with Sec. 300.520 and section 615(m)(1)(A) of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding the public agency's responsibility to invite a child who has not reached the age of majority to the child's IEP Team meeting when a parent does not want the child to attend.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.321(b)(1) requires the public agency to invite a child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals, regardless of whether the child has reached the age of majority.  However, until the child reaches the age of majority under State law, unless the rights of the parent to act for the child are extinguished or otherwise limited, only the parent has the authority to make educational decisions for the child under Part B of the Act, including whether the child should attend an IEP Team meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that Sec. 300.321(b) does not require children to have sufficient input as a member of the IEP Team and recommended requiring the IEP Team to more strongly consider the child's preferences and needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.321(a)(7) includes the child as a member of the IEP Team, when appropriate, and Sec. 300.321(b)(1) requires the public agency to invite the child to the child's IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals.  Further, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.  We believe this is sufficient to ensure that the child's preferences and needs are considered and do not believe that any changes to Sec. 300.321(b) are necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b), regarding transition services participants, are not in the Act, are too rigid, and should be modified to provide more flexibility for individual children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that, although not specified in the Act, the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b) are necessary to assist children with disabilities to successfully transition from high school to employment, training, and postsecondary education opportunities.  We believe it is critical for children with disabilities to be involved in determining their transition goals, as well as the services that will be used to reach those goals.  Section 300.321(b), therefore, requires the public agency to invite the child to attend IEP Team meetings in which transition goals and services will be discussed.  If the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also believe that, when it is likely that a child will be involved with other agencies that provide or pay for transition services or postsecondary services, it is appropriate (provided that the parent, or a child who has reached the age of majority, consents) for representatives from such agencies to be invited to the child's IEP Team meeting.  The involvement and collaboration with other public agencies (e.g., vocational rehabilitation agencies, the Social Security Administration) can be helpful in planning for transition and in providing resources that will help children when they leave high school.  We believe that children with disabilities will benefit when transition services under the Act are coordinated with vocational rehabilitation services, as well as other supports and programs that serve all children moving from school to adult life.  Therefore, we decline to change the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.321(b)(1), which requires the public agency to invite the child to an IEP Team meeting when transition is to be considered, duplicates Sec. 300.321(a)(7), which requires a child with a disability to be invited to his or her IEP Team meeting, whenever possible.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  These two provisions are not redundant.  Section 300.321(a)(7) requires the public agency to include the child with a disability, when appropriate (not "whenever possible," as stated by the commenter), in the child's IEP Team meeting, and, thus, provides discretion for the parent and the public agency to determine when it is appropriate to include the child in the IEP Team meeting.  Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.  The Department believes it is important for a child with a disability to participate in determining the child's postsecondary goals and for the IEP Team to consider the child's preferences and interests in determining those goals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) for parental consent (or consent of a child who has reached the age of majority) before inviting personnel from participating agencies to attend an IEP Team meeting because it is burdensome, may reduce the number of agencies participating in the IEP Team meeting, and may limit the options for transition services for the child.  The commenters stated that this consent is unnecessary under FERPA, and inconsistent with Sec. 300.321(a)(6), which allows the parent or the agency to include other individuals in the IEP Team who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.321(b)(3) was included in the regulations specifically to address issues related to the confidentiality of information.  Under section 617(c) of the Act the Department must ensure the protection of the confidentiality of any personally identifiable data, information, and records collected or maintained by the Secretary and by SEAs and LEAs pursuant to Part B of the Act, irrespective of the requirements under FERPA.  We continue to believe that a public agency should be required to obtain parental consent (or the consent of a child who has reached the age of majority) before inviting representatives from other participating agencies to attend an IEP Team meeting, consistent with Sec. 300.321(b)(3).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) are inconsistent with Sec. 300.321(a)(6).  Section 300.321(a)(6) permits other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child to attend the child's IEP Team meeting at the discretion of the parent or the public agency.  It is clear that in Sec. 300.321(b)(3), the individuals invited to the IEP Team meeting are representatives from other agencies who do not necessarily have special knowledge or expertise regarding the child.  In these situations, we believe that consent should be required because representatives of these agencies are invited to participate in a child's IEP Team meeting only because they may be providing or paying for transition services.  We do not believe that representatives of these agencies should have access to all the child's records unless the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) gives consent for such a disclosure.  Therefore, we believe it is important to include the requirement for consent in Sec. 300.321(b)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing the phrase, "to the extent appropriate" in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) and requiring public agencies to invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services to the IEP Team meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the recommended change because the decision as to whether to invite a particular agency to participate in a child's IEP Team meeting is a decision that should be left to the public agency and the parent (or the child with a disability who has reached the age of majority).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii), which requires the public agency to take steps to ensure the participation of invited agencies in the planning of any transition services when the agencies do not send a representative to the IEP Team meeting.  These commenters stated that the participation of other agencies is vital to ensuring that the child receives the necessary services.  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that, aside from inviting other agencies to attend a child's IEP Team meeting, public agencies have no obligation to obtain the participation of agencies likely to provide transition services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act has never given public agencies the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services for a child with a disability, including when the requirements in Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) were in effect.  Without the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services, public agencies have not been able to meet the requirement in current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) to "ensure" the participation of other agencies in transition planning.  Therefore, while we believe that public agencies should take steps to obtain the participation of other agencies in the planning of transition services for a child, we believe it is unhelpful to retain current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations require the public agency to put parents in touch with agencies providing transition services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate to require public agencies to put parents in touch with agencies providing transition services.  As a matter of practice, public agencies regularly provide information to children and parents about transition services during the course of planning and developing transition goals and determining the services that are necessary to meet the child's transition goals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether a parent could exclude an individual from the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  A parent can refuse to provide consent only for the public agency to invite other agencies that are likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services.  A parent may not exclude any of the required members of the IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
