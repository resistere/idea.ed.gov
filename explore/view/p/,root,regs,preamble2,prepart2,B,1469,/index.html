Preparation and delivery of files (Sec. 300.172(c))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require instructional materials provided to children with disabilities to be complete and accurate.  Another commenter requested requiring publishers to provide copies of the original books to the NIMAC along with the electronic files, because a copy of the original book is necessary for alignment of page numbers and descriptions of pictures.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We understand and appreciate the importance of having a copy of the original material to ensure accuracy of the files.  However, the NIMAC is not responsible for ensuring the accuracy of materials, aligning page numbers, or describing pictures.  Rather, the NIMAC is a distribution center for NIMAS files obtained from publishers, SEAs, and LEAs.  Consistent with section 674(e)(3)(A) of the Act, the duties of the NIMAC are to receive and maintain a catalog of print instructional materials prepared in the NIMAS format and made available to the NIMAC by the textbook publishing industry, SEAs, and LEAs.  Accessible, student-ready versions of instructional materials are created from NIMAS source files by national third-party conversion organizations; regional or State conversion sources; desktop applications created by software developers; or curriculum publishers that produce accessible alternate format versions for direct sale to SEAs and LEAs.  The Act does not authorize the Department to impose obligations on such entities to provide accurate materials.  States and LEAs that contract with such entities, however, may wish to require the accuracy of such materials, including the alignment of page numbers and descriptions of pictures, as part of their agreements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested that the regulations permit an SEA to receive assistance from the NIMAC, even if the SEA is not formally coordinating with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not require the NIMAC to provide assistance to SEAs if the SEA has chosen not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  However, there is nothing in the Act that would prevent the NIMAC from doing so.  As stated in section 674(e)(2)(B) of the Act, the NIMAC must provide access to print instructional materials, including textbooks, in accessible media, free of charge, to blind or other persons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools, in accordance with such terms and procedures as the NIMAC may prescribe.  Providing this access could include assisting an SEA, even if the SEA has chosen not to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations include an accountability mechanism so that parents and schools know whether the State or LEA is responsible for the timely delivery of instructional materials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Whether instructional materials are purchased by the State or LEA is a State matter.  The Act does not authorize the Department to impose obligations on States or LEAs with respect to the process for timely delivery of instructional materials.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter emphasized the need to track the progress and monitor the advancement of accessible materials on a national and regional level.  Another commenter stated that there is a need to establish SEA and LEA baseline data regarding the timeliness, quality, and quantity of alternate formats in schools.  One commenter stated that States should be required to publicize information regarding whether the State is meeting its responsibilities to provide accessible materials to persons who are blind or other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that it would be overly burdensome to require States to collect and report data on the timeliness, quality, and quantity of alternate formats provided to children with disabilities in order to track the availability of accessible materials for children with disabilities on a regional or national level.  Under the State complaint procedures, States are responsible for resolving complaints alleging violations of requirements under the Act, including this one.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested information on the scope of the NIMAC's responsibilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The duties of the NIMAC are specified in section 674(e)(2) of the Act and include:  (a) receiving and maintaining a catalog of print instructional materials prepared in the NIMAS format; (b) providing access to print instructional materials in accessible media, free of charge to blind or other persons with print disabilities in elementary schools and secondary schools; and (c) developing, adopting, and publishing procedures to protect against copyright infringement, with respect to print instructional materials provided under sections 612(a)(23) and 613(a)(6) of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 674(c) of the Act provides that NIMAC's duties apply to print instructional materials published after July 19, 2006, the date on which the final rule establishing the NIMAS is published in the Federal Register (71 FR 41084).  The Department interprets "publish" to have the plain meaning of the word, which is to issue for sale or distribution to the public.  The NIMAC's duties, therefore, apply to print instructional materials made available to the public for sale after the NIMAS is published in the Federal Register.  However, this does not relieve SEAs and LEAs of their responsibility to provide accessible instructional materials in a timely manner, regardless of when the instructional materials were "published."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations do not specify the structure and operation of the NIMAC.  One commenter requested that the Department provide more information about the operation of the NIMAC.  Another commenter recommended that the NIMAC's management board include representatives of authorized entities.  One commenter requested information on the legal protections that the Department will provide to the NIMAC.  Another commenter requested specific information on the process and timing of the funding of the NIMAC.  One commenter recommended a timeline with a series of activities (e.g., establishment of a cooperative agreement, cost projections) to ensure that the NIMAC is operational.  Another commenter recommended that the Department develop a process to ensure that the files included in the NIMAC are NIMAS compliant, complete, and of the highest quality.  One commenter expressed concern about how NIMAS files will be bundled and delivered to the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that regulations on the structure, operation, or budget of the NIMAC are necessary.  Section 674(e) of the Act establishes the NIMAC through the American Printing House for the Blind (APH) and allows the NIMAC to prescribe terms and procedures to perform its duties under the Act.  The Department's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) will oversee the administration of the NIMAC through a cooperative agreement with the APH and will work with the NIMAC to establish its structure, operating procedures, and budget.  The NIMAC procedures will be available on the NIMAC Web site at:  http://www.nimac.us.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the duties of the NIMAC to receive and maintain electronic files of instructional materials provided by publishers should not be misconstrued as imposing a duty on the NIMAC itself to use the NIMAS files to reproduce the instructional materials in accessible formats for children with print disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act clarifies that the NIMAC is not responsible for producing instructional materials in accessible formats.  As stated in section 674(e)(2) of the Act, the NIMAC receives and maintains a catalog of print instructional materials prepared in the NIMAS, and made available to the NIMAC by the textbook publishing industry, SEAs, and LEAs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about clear guidance regarding electronic rights.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations require the NIMAC to develop a user agreement that any entity seeking access to a NIMAS file must sign.  The commenters stated that the agreement should detail the entities that are eligible under Federal copyright law and the Act to access the NIMAS files, the alternate formats that may be produced, and any other restrictions on the dissemination and use of NIMAS files.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that the regulations should require that the authorized entities have full, complete, and immediate access to deposited files and clarify that the authorized entities are responsible for reproducing the instructional materials in an accessible format and therefore, the files housed by the NIMAC should be free of charge.  Another commenter stated that the Department should ensure that NIMAS books are available to all authorized entities and the appropriate State organizations within five days after the books are deposited in the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate or necessary to regulate on the authorized entities eligible to have access to the NIMAS files.  Under section 674(e)(2)(C) of the Act, the NIMAC is required to develop, adopt, and publish procedures to protect against copyright infringement, with respect to the print instructional materials produced using the NIMAS and provided by SEAs and LEAs to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities.  Such procedures will address, for example, information regarding the authorized entities that are eligible to have access to NIMAS files, responsibilities of such authorized entities, and how and when access will be provided.  The NIMAC procedures will be available on the NIMAC Web site at:  http://www.nimac.us.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested several changes in the process to make Braille copies of instructional materials including constructing directions for choosing answers in universal terms, such as "write the correct response," rather than "circle" or "underline;" describing, in writing, visuals that cannot be easily interpreted; using hard paper for Braille and raised drawings, rather than thermoform; using hard-bound bindings for text, rather than plastic spiral binders; using audio formats as supplemental materials; and using simple graphics with easy access to map keys on the same page. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Procedures for Braille transcribers and for conversion entities are the responsibility of SEAs and LEAs and, as such, are beyond the scope of these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that software companies routinely create desktop publishing programs that contain text to speech capabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is beyond the Department's authority to impose requirements on software companies. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that a NIMAS style guide be developed that is textbook specific. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The NIMAS Technical Assistance Center will develop a best practices Web page with exemplars and a style guide.  This technical assistance resource will be available at:  http://nimas.cast.org.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
