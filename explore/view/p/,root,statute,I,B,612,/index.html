Subsequent years.--If, for any year, a State                 fails to meet the requirement of subparagraph (A),                 including any year for which the State is granted a                 waiver under subparagraph (C), the financial support                 required of the State in future years under subparagraph                 (A) shall                be the amount that would have been required in the                 absence of that failure and not the reduced level of the                 State's support.

Review of findings of fact.--The findings of                 fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial                 evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good                 cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to                 take further                evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or                 modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's                 previous action, and shall file in the court the record                 of the further proceedings. Such new or modified                 findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if                 supported by substantial evidence.
