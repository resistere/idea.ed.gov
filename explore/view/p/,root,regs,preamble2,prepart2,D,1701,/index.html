Parental consent for initial evaluation (Sec. 300.300(a))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require a public agency to conduct the following activities to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation:  identify the child's parents and their address and phone number; contact social service providers for children who are wards of the State; provide parents with copies of the Act; and inform parents of the consequences of withholding consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The regulations already provide sufficient safeguards regarding consent, and we believe that the changes requested would be unduly burdensome.  As a matter of practice, public agencies begin the process of obtaining parental consent by identifying the parent and contacting the parent by phone or through written correspondence, or speaking to the parent in parent-teacher conferences.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is necessary to regulate to require public agencies to contact social service agencies to obtain consent for children who are wards of the State because it may not always be necessary or appropriate, for example, when a child who is a ward of the State has a foster parent who can act as a parent, consistent with Sec. 300.30(a)(2).  Additionally, section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act provides that the public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent for children who are wards of the State and not residing with the parent.  Public agencies are in the best position to determine, on a case-by-case basis, when it is necessary to contact social service providers to assist in obtaining parental consent for children who are wards of the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also do not believe that additional regulations are necessary to require public agencies to inform parents of the consequences of withholding consent for an initial evaluation or to provide parents with copies of the Act.  Section 300.503, consistent with section 615(c)(1) of the Act, already requires that prior written notice be provided to parents before an initial evaluation, which will explain, among other things, why the agency is proposing to conduct the evaluation; a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for proposing to conduct the evaluation; and sources for the parent to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions under the Act.  Additionally, Sec. 300.504(a)(1), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, requires the public agency to provide a copy of the procedural safeguards to parents upon initial referral for an evaluation, which provides information about parents' rights under the Act.  Although we do not believe the recommended requirements should be added to the regulations, we will add the cross-references to the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9, and the requirements for prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice in Sec. Sec. 300.503 and 300.504, respectively, to Sec. 300.300(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added cross-references to Sec. Sec. 300.9, 300.503, and 300.504 in Sec. 300.300(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii) and using the statutory language in section 614(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to require that parental consent for evaluation may not be construed as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is appropriate to use the phrase, "initial provision of services" in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii), rather than the statutory phrase "consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services," in section 614(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to clarify that consent does not need to be sought every time a particular service is provided to the child.  In addition, the distinction between consent for an initial evaluation and consent for initial services is more clearly conveyed in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii) than in the statutory language, and is consistent with the Department's longstanding position that "placement" refers to the provision of special education services, rather than a specific place, such as a specific classroom or specific school.  We, therefore, decline to change the regulation, as requested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify whether the reference to "parent" in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) means "biological or adoptive parent" or anyone who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(2) applies to circumstances in which the child is a ward of the State and is not residing with the child's parents, and requires the public agency to make reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent from the parent for an initial evaluation.  The reference to "parent," in this context, refers to anyone who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30, consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification on the interplay between new Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), regarding circumstances when the public agency is not required to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation of a child who is a ward of the State, and the requirements in Sec. 300.519(c), which require that a surrogate parent be appointed for a child who is a ward of the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II) of the Act, creates an exception to the parental consent requirements for initial evaluations for a child who is a ward of the State who is not residing with the child's parent if the public agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain the parent's consent, but is unable to discover the whereabouts of the parent, the rights of the parent of the child have been terminated under State law, or the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge under State law and consent for the initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)) permits the public agency to proceed with the child's initial evaluation without first obtaining the requisite parental consent only in the circumstances detailed in Sec. 300.300(a)(2).  Therefore, when one or more of the circumstances in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) are met and a surrogate has not yet been appointed, the public agency need not postpone the child's evaluation to await the appointment of a surrogate.  This is appropriate because in situations involving requests for initial evaluations, in most cases a surrogate parent has not yet been appointed and delaying an initial evaluation until after a surrogate is appointed and has given consent may not be in the best interests of the child.  In contrast, in most situations involving consent for reevaluation, a surrogate parent should already have been appointed under Sec. 300.519 if no parent can be identified, the public agency has been unable to locate a parent, the child is a ward of the State or the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth.  Therefore, we do not think it is appropriate to apply the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) to reevaluation situations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Nothing in this section is intended to relieve a public agency of its obligation to ensure that the rights of a child who is a ward of the State are protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 300.519(b) through (h).  Once a surrogate parent is appointed in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 300.519(b) through (h), that person assumes the responsibilities of a parent under the Act, and the public agency must seek consent from that individual. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Moreover, if a child has a foster parent who can act as a parent, as defined in Sec. 300.30(a)(2), or a person such as a grandparent or step-parent who is legally responsible for the child's welfare, and that person's whereabouts are known or the person can be located after reasonable efforts by the public agency, parental consent would be required for the initial evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that the phrase "except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding consent for wards of the State)" in proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(i) may incorrectly convey that a public agency is not required to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent of a child who is a ward of the State, or from a surrogate parent, foster parent, or other person meeting the definition of a parent in Sec. 300.30(a).  Therefore, we will remove the phrase.  To clarify that the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) apply only to initial evaluations, and not reevaluations, we will modify both Sec. Sec. 300.300(a)(2) and (c)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding consent for wards of the State)" in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(i), for clarity.  We have also added introductory language to Sec. 300.300(a)(2) to specify that it applies only to initial evaluations, and we have changed the cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to refer to Sec. 300.300(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations specify the minimum steps that public agencies must take to obtain consent for initial evaluations from parents of children who are wards of the State.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations define "reasonable efforts," as used in new Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i)).  One commenter recommended requiring LEAs to maintain documentation of their efforts to obtain parental consent for initial evaluations, including attempts to obtain consent by telephone calls, visits to the parent's home, and correspondence in the parent's native language.  Several commenters requested that the requirements in current Sec. 300.345(d) be included in new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(A)).  Current Sec. 300.345(d) requires a public agency to document the specific steps it has taken to arrange a mutually convenient time and place for an IEP Team meeting (e.g., detailed records of telephone calls, any correspondence sent to the parents, visits made to the parent's home or place of employment) and it is cross-referenced in current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) to identify documentation of the reasonable measures that an LEA took to obtain consent for a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is important to emphasize that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This includes the parent of a child who is a ward of the State.  Therefore, we will add a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to Sec. 300.300 to make clear that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent whenever a public agency seeks to conduct an initial evaluation of a child to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This requirement applies to all children including children who are wards of the State.  With the addition of this new paragraph, the requirement for public agencies to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation for children who are wards of the State in Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) is no longer necessary and will be removed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also agree with the commenters that a public agency should document and make the same reasonable efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation from a parent, including a parent of a child who is a ward of the State, that are required when a public agency attempts to arrange a mutually convenient time and place for an IEP Team meeting (e.g., detailed records of telephone calls, any correspondence sent to the parents, visits made to the parent's home or place of employment), and will add a new paragraph (d)(5) to make this clear.  We recognize that the statute uses both "reasonable measures" and "reasonable efforts" when referring to a public agency's responsibility to obtain parental consent for an evaluation, initial services, and a reevaluation.  We believe these two phrases, when used in this context, have the same meaning and, therefore, have used "reasonable efforts" throughout the regulations related to parental consent for consistency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to Sec. 300.300 to require a public agency to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation.  We will remove Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) because it is redundant with the new paragraph.  Section 300.300(a)(2) has been reformatted consistent with the removal of paragraph (a)(2)(i).  We also have added a new paragraph (d)(5) to Sec. 300.300 to require a public agency to document its attempts to obtain parental consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters asked whether a public agency must obtain consent for an initial evaluation from the biological or adoptive parent of the child when there is another person who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30.  Another commenter recommended the regulations clarify whether a public agency must seek informed consent for an initial evaluation from a biological or adoptive parent when a surrogate parent has already been appointed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(1) provides that, when more than one party is qualified to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent, when attempting to act as the parent under the Act, must be presumed to be the parent, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a surrogate parent already has been appointed because the public agency, after reasonable efforts, could not locate a parent, the public agency would not have to again attempt to contact other individuals meeting the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30 to seek consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify whether the qualifications of a judge-appointed surrogate parent in Sec. 300.519(c) would apply to new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)), regarding consent for an initial evaluation for a child who is a ward of the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II)(cc) of the Act, which is the basis for new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)), provides that the public agency is not required to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation of a child who is a ward of the State and is not living with the child's parent if the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  This is a special situation, limited only to children who are wards of the State not living with a parent and limited only to the situation of seeking consent for an initial evaluation.  A person appointed under this provision is not a surrogate parent as that term is used in these regulations.  The requirements of Sec. 300.519(c) do not apply to persons authorized to provide consent for initial evaluations under this provision. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is noteworthy that the provision in new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)) is only a limited exception to the requirement to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation.  Most children will not have a surrogate parent already appointed at this stage of their involvement with services under the Act.  However, if a child has a surrogate parent appointed under Sec. 300.519(c), and the rights of that person to make educational decisions for the child have not been subrogated by a judge under State law, the public agency would have to seek informed parental consent from that person.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.300(a)(3) to prohibit a public agency from pursuing an initial evaluation without parental consent.  Another commenter recommended requiring a public agency to use the due process procedures to conduct an initial evaluation if the parent does not provide consent and the public agency believes that the child would not otherwise receive needed services.  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.300(a)(3) is inconsistent with statutory language and opposed language stating that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of a child whose parents have refused to consent or failed to respond to a request for consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(3) is consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act, which states that a public agency may pursue the initial evaluation of a child using the procedural safeguards if a parent does not provide consent or fails to respond to a request to provide consent for an initial evaluation.  Consistent with the Department's position that public agencies should use their consent override procedures only in rare circumstances, Sec. 300.300(a)(3) clarifies that a public agency is not required to pursue an initial evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability if the parent does not provide consent for the initial evaluation.  State and local educational agency authorities are in the best position to determine whether, in a particular case, an initial evaluation should be pursued.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying the parental consent requirements for an initial evaluation.  Many commenters recommended that LEAs maintain documentation that the parent has been fully informed and understands the nature and scope of the evaluation.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require that informed parental consent for an initial evaluation be documented in writing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(I) of the Act, is clear that the public agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8 must obtain consent from the parent of the child before conducting the evaluation.  Consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9, means that the parent has been fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, and understands and agrees in writing to the initial evaluation.  The methods by which a public agency seeks to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation (beyond the requirement that the public agency use the parent's native language or mode of communication) and how a public agency documents its efforts to obtain the parent's written consent are appropriately left to the discretion of SEAs and LEAs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations include language clarifying that a public agency is not in violation of the FAPE requirements if the public agency does not pursue an initial evaluation when the parent refuses to consent or fails to respond to a request for consent.  One commenter recommended adding language to the regulations to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to an initial evaluation, the child would not be considered to be a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While we agree that a public agency would not be in violation of the FAPE requirements for failing to pursue an initial evaluation through due process, we do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary.  The FAPE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.101 through 300.112, consistent with section 612(a) of the Act, apply only to a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8 and section 602(3) of the Act.  A child would not be considered a child with a disability under the Act if the child has not been evaluated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 and determined to have one of the disabilities in Sec. 300.8(a), and because of that disability, needs special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Further, Sec. 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability, for disciplinary purposes, if a parent has not allowed the child to be evaluated or refuses services under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We agree that States and LEAs should not be considered to be in violation of their obligation to locate, identify, and evaluate children suspected of being children with disabilities under Sec. 300.111 and section 612(a)(3) of the Act if they decline to pursue an evaluation (or reevaluation) to which a parent has refused or failed to consent.  We will add language to the regulations to make this clear.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language to Sec. 300.300(a)(3) and (c)(1) to clarify that a State or public agency does not violate the requirements of Sec. 300.111 and Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue an evaluation or reevaluation to which a parent has refused or failed to consent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations define "fails to respond" as used in Sec. 300.300(a)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(3), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that if a parent of a child enrolled in public school, or seeking to be enrolled in public school, does not provide consent for an initial evaluation, or the parent "fails to respond" to a request to provide consent, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedural safeguards, if appropriate, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such parental consent.  The meaning of "fails to respond," in this context, is generally understood to mean that, in spite of a public agency's efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation, the parent has not indicated whether the parent consents or refuses consent to the evaluation.  We believe the meaning is clear in the regulations and, therefore, decline to define the phrase in these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations include language to require a public agency to provide the following information (in the parent's native language) to a parent who refuses consent or fails to respond to a request for consent for an initial evaluation:  the reasons why the public agency believes the child may be eligible for special education; confirmation that the requested evaluation and any subsequent special education services will be provided at no cost and scheduled in cooperation with parents with transportation provided; the nature of the evaluations and credentials of evaluators; the types of special education services that the child could receive if eligible; and the risks of delaying an evaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The prior written notice requirements in Sec. 300.503, consistent with section 615(c)(1) of the Act, address many of the concerns raised by the commenter.  Consistent with Sec. 300.503(b) and (c), prior notice must be given to the parents when a public agency proposes to evaluate a child and would explain why the public agency believes the child needs an evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability under the Act; describe each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for proposing that the child needs an evaluation; explain that the parents have protection under the Act's procedural safeguards; provide sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions of the Act; and describe other factors that are relevant to the agency's proposal to conduct the evaluation of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In addition to the prior written notice, Sec. 300.504(a)(1), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents upon an initial referral or parental request for an evaluation.  Consistent with Sec. 300.503(c) and Sec. 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and be provided in the native language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As a matter of practice, public agencies provide parents with general information about the special education and related services that are available to eligible children with disabilities and inform the parent that the public agency's evaluation is provided at no cost.  We believe that this information, along with the information provided in the prior written notice and procedural safeguards notice, will help a parent determine whether there are any risks of delaying an evaluation.  Therefore, we do not believe additional regulations are necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to information regarding an evaluator's credentials, we do not believe it is necessary to require public agencies to provide this information to parents because Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(v) and section 614(b)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act require the public agency to ensure that the evaluation is conducted by trained and knowledgeable personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If transportation to an evaluation outside the school environment is necessary, the public agency would have to provide it, as a part of its obligation to ensure that all eligible children are located, identified, and evaluated.  However, we do not believe that the parents need to be notified of this fact because, in most cases, children can be evaluated at school during the school day and there is no requirement that a parent be present during the evaluation.  Thus, requiring that all parents be notified about transportation to evaluations would be unnecessarily burdensome.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
