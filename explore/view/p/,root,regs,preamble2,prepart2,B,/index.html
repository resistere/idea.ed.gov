Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.101 to ensure that children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement are provided educational services consistent with State academic achievement standards.  One commenter asked whether children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement must continue to be taught by highly qualified teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the concern raised by the commenter is already addressed by this regulation and elsewhere in the regulations and that no changes to Sec. 300.101 are necessary.  Section 300.530(d), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(D) of the Act, clarifies that a child with a disability who is removed from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons, irrespective of whether the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability, must be allowed to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting his or her IEP goals.  As the term "general education curriculum" is used throughout the Act and in these regulations, the clear implication is that there is an education curriculum that is applicable to all children and that this curriculum is based on the State's academic content standards.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement in public schools must continue to be taught by highly qualified teachers, consistent with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.156 and 300.18.  Private school teachers are not subject to the highly qualified teacher requirements under this part.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested clarifying in Sec. 300.101 that FAPE must be available to children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended including language in Sec. 300.101(a) specifying that children with disabilities expelled or suspended from the general education classroom must be provided FAPE in the least restrictive environment.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department believes it would not be appropriate to include the requested language in this section because services in these circumstances are provided under somewhat different criteria than is normally the case.  Section 300.530 clarifies the procedures school personnel must follow when removing a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from their current placement (e.g., suspension and expulsion).  This includes how decisions are made regarding the educational services the child receives and the location in which they will be provided.  School officials need some reasonable amount of flexibility in providing services to children with disabilities who have violated school conduct rules, and should not necessarily have to provide exactly the same services, in the same settings, to these children.  Therefore, we decline to regulate further in this regard.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters expressed concern that children with disabilities have to fail or be retained in a grade or course in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.  However, to provide additional clarity we will revise paragraph (c)(1) of this section to explicitly state that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.101(c)(1) has been revised to provide that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Limitation--exception to FAPE for certain ages (Sec. 300.102)  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that children with disabilities who do not receive a regular high school diploma continue to be eligible for special education and related services.  One commenter expressed concern that the provision in Sec. 300.102(a)(3)(ii) regarding children with disabilities who have not been awarded a regular high school diploma could result in the delay of transition services in the context of the child's secondary school experience and postsecondary goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.102(a)(3) is sufficiently clear that public agencies need not make FAPE available to children with disabilities who have graduated with a regular high school diploma and that no change is needed to the regulations.  Children with disabilities who have not graduated with a regular high school diploma still have an entitlement to FAPE until the child reaches the age at which eligibility ceases under the age requirements within the State.  However, we have reviewed the regulations and believe that it is important for these regulations to define "regular diploma" consistent with the ESEA regulations in 34 CFR Sec. 200.19(a)(1)(i).  Therefore, we will add language to clarify that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or general educational development (GED) credential.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe Sec. 300.102 could be interpreted to permit public agencies to delay implementation of transition services, as stated by one commenter because transition services must be provided based on a child's age, not the number of years the child has remaining the child's high school career.  Section 300.320(b), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act, requires each child's IEP to include, beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, appropriate measurable postsecondary goals and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (iv) has been added in Sec. 300.102(a)(3) stating that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or GED.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification as to how States should include children with disabilities who require special education services through age 21 in calculating, for adequate yearly progress (AYP) purposes, the percentage of children who graduate with a regular high school diploma in the standard number of years.  The commenter expressed concern that States, in order to comply with their high school graduation rate academic outcome requirements under the ESEA, will change the grade status from 12th grade to 11th grade for those children with disabilities who will typically age out of the public education system under the Act.  The commenter further stated that this will affect the exception to FAPE provisions in Sec. 300.102 for children with disabilities who require special education services through age 21.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The calculation of graduation rates under the ESEA for AYP purposes (34 CFR 200.19(a)(1)(i)) does not alter the exception to FAPE provisions in Sec. 300.102(a)(3) for children with disabilities who graduate from high school with a regular high school diploma, but not in the standard number of years.  The public agency must make FAPE available until age 21 or the age limit established by State law, even though the child would not be included as graduating for AYP purposes under the ESEA.  In practice, though, there is no conflict between the Act and the ESEA, as the Department interprets the ESEA title I regulations to permit States to propose a method for accurately accounting for students who legitimately take longer than the standard number of years to graduate. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Residential placement (Sec. 300.104)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C786%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that parents cannot be held liable for any costs if their child with a disability is placed in a residential setting by a public agency in order to provide FAPE to the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.104, consistent with section 612(a)(1) and (a)(10)(B) of the Act, is a longstanding provision that applies to placements that are made by public agencies in public and private institutions for educational purposes and clarifies that parents are not required to bear the costs of a public or private residential placement if such placement is determined necessary to provide FAPE.  If a public agency determines in an individual situation that a child with a disability cannot receive FAPE from the programs that the public agency conducts and, therefore, placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide special education and related services to the child, the program, including non-medical care and room and board, must be at no cost to the parents of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In situations where a child's educational needs are inseparable from the child's emotional needs and an individual determination is made that the child requires the therapeutic and habilitation services of a residential program in order to "benefit from special education," these therapeutic and habilitation services may be "related services" under the Act.  In such a case, the SEA is responsible for ensuring that the entire cost of that child's placement, including the therapeutic care as well as room and board, is without cost to the parents.  However, the SEA is not responsible for providing medical care.  Thus, visits to a doctor for treatment of medical conditions are not covered services under Part B of the Act and parents may be responsible for the cost of the medical care.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended removing Sec. 300.105 and including the requirements in this section in the definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 and assistive technology service in Sec. 300.6. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.5 and Sec. 300.6 define the terms assistive technology device and assistive technology service, respectively.  Section 300.105 is not part of the definition of these terms, but rather is necessary to specify the circumstances under which public agencies are responsible for making available assistive technology devices and assistive technology services to children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested clarifying in Sec. 300.105(b) whether hearing aids are included in the definition of an assistive technology device.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An assistive technology device, as defined in Sec. 300.5, means any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability.  The decision of whether a hearing aid is an assistive technology device is a determination that is made on an individual basis by the child's IEP Team.  However, even if the IEP Team determines that a hearing aid is an assistive technology device, within the meaning of Sec. 300.5, for a particular child, the public agency is responsible for the provision of the assistive technology device as part of FAPE, only if, as specified in Sec. 300.105, the device is required as part of the child's special education defined in Sec. 300.39, related services defined in Sec. 300.34, or supplementary aids and services defined in Sec. 300.42.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As a general matter, public agencies are not responsible for providing personal devices, such as eyeglasses or hearing aids that a child with a disability requires, regardless of whether the child is attending school.  However, if it is not a surgically implanted device and a child's IEP Team determines that the child requires a personal device (e.g., eyeglasses) in order to receive FAPE, the public agency must ensure that the device is provided at no cost to the child's parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language to Sec. 300.105(b) to include, in addition to hearing aids, other hearing enhancement devices, such as a cochlear implant.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.105(b), as proposed, requires a public agency to ensure that hearing aids worn in school by children with hearing impairments, including deafness, are functioning properly.  This is a longstanding requirement and was included pursuant to a House Committee Report on the 1978 appropriations bill (H. Rpt. No. 95-381, p. 67 (1977)) directing the Department to ensure that children with hearing impairments are receiving adequate professional assessment, follow-up, and services.  The Department believes that, given the increase in the number of children with disabilities with surgically implanted devices (e.g., cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulators, electronic muscle stimulators), and rapid advances in new technologies to help children with disabilities, it is important that these regulations clearly address any obligation public agencies have to provide follow-up and services to ensure that such devices are functioning properly.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 602(1) of the Act clarifies that the definition of assistive technology device does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Section 602(26) of the Act also stipulates that only medical services that are for diagnostic and evaluative purposes and required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education are considered a related service.  We believe Congress was clear in its intent in S. Rpt. 108-185, p. 8, which states:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
[T]he definitions of "assistive technology device" and "related services" do not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the post-surgical maintenance, programming, or replacement of such device, or an external device connected with the use of a surgically implanted medical device (other than the costs of performing routine maintenance and monitoring of such external device at the same time the child is receiving other services under the act).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Department believes, however, that public agencies have an obligation to change a battery or routinely check an external component of a surgically implanted medical device to make sure it is turned on and operating.  However, mapping a cochlear implant (or paying the costs associated with mapping) is not routine checking as described above and should not be the responsibility of a public agency.  We will add language to the regulations to clarify a public agency's responsibility regarding the routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new Sec. 300.113 has been added with the heading, "Routine checking of hearing aids and external components of surgically implanted medical devices."  Section 300.105(b), regarding the proper functioning of hearing aids, has been removed and redesignated as new Sec. 300.113(a).  We have added a new paragraph (b) in new Sec. 300.113 clarifying that, for a child with a surgically implanted medical device who is receiving special education and related services under this part, a public agency is responsible for routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices, but is not responsible for the post-surgical maintenance, programming, or replacement of a medical device that has been surgically implanted (or of an external component of a surgically implanted medical device).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing Sec. 300.106 because the requirement to provide extended school year (ESY) services to children with disabilities is not required in the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the ESY requirements in Sec. 300.106 should not be included as part of the State eligibility requirements and would be more appropriately included in the definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17 is taken directly from section 602(9) of the Act.  We believe the ESY requirements are appropriately included under the FAPE requirements as a part of a State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act because the right of an individual child with a disability to ESY services is based on a child's entitlement to FAPE.  As a part of the State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act, the State must make FAPE available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandated age ranges.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended removing the word "only" in Sec. 300.106(a)(2) because it is unduly limiting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The inclusion of the word "only" is intended to be limiting.  ESY services must be provided "only" if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual basis, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324, that the services are necessary for the provision of FAPE to the child.  We do not think this language is overly restrictive; instead, we think it is necessary for providing appropriate parameters to the responsibility of the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters suggested revising Sec. 300.106(a)(3)(i) to specifically state that, in addition to particular categories of disabilities, public agencies may not limit ESY services to particular age ranges.  Other commenters proposed adding "preschooler with a disability" to the definition of ESY services in Sec. 300.106(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The revisions recommended by the commenters are not necessary.  Section 300.106(a) clarifies that each public agency must ensure that ESY services are available for children with disabilities if those services are necessary for the children to receive FAPE.  Section 300.101(a) clearly states that FAPE must be available to all children aged 3 through 21, inclusive, residing in the State, except for children ages 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20, or 21 to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, regarding the provision of public education to children of those ages.  We do not believe any further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that language be added to Sec. 300.106(b)(1)(i) to clarify that providing ESY services to a child with a disability beyond the normal school year includes, but is not limited to, before and after regular school hours, on weekends, and during regular school vacations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Typically, ESY services are provided during the summer months.  However, there is nothing in Sec. 300.106 that would limit a public agency from providing ESY services to a child with a disability during times other than the summer, such as before and after regular school hours or during school vacations, if the IEP Team determines that the child requires ESY services during those time periods in order to receive FAPE.  The regulations give the IEP Team the flexibility to determine when ESY services are appropriate, depending on the circumstances of the individual child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language to Sec. 300.106 clarifying that "recoupment and retention" should not be used as the sole criteria for determining the child's eligibility for ESY services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the commenter's suggested change should be made.  The concepts of "recoupment" and "likelihood of regression or retention" have formed the basis for many standards that States use in making ESY eligibility determinations and are derived from well-established judicial precedents.  (See, for example, Johnson v. Bixby Independent School District 4, 921 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir. 1990); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983); GARC v. McDaniel, 716 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir. 1983)).  States may use recoupment and retention as their sole criteria but they are not limited to these standards and have considerable flexibility in determining eligibility for ESY services and establishing State standards for making ESY determinations.  However, whatever standard a State uses must be consistent with the individually-oriented requirements of the Act and may not limit eligibility for ESY services to children with a particular disability category or be applied in a manner that denies children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE access to necessary ESY services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We agree with the commenter.  Section 300.107(a), as proposed, requires public agencies to take steps to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in a manner necessary to afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in those services and activities.  In addition, Sec. 300.320(a)(4)(ii), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(i)(IV)(bb) of the Act, clarifies that an IEP must include a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child to participate in extracurricular and other nonacademic activities.  We will add language in Sec. 300.107(a) to clarify that the steps taken by public agencies to provide access to nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities include the provision of supplementary aids and services determined appropriate and necessary by the child's IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Additional language has been added in Sec. 300.107(a) to clarify that the steps taken by public agencies to provide access to nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities include the provision of supplementary aids and services determined appropriate and necessary by the child's IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about including "nonacademic services" in Sec. 300.107, because it is not in the Act.  The commenter stated that services such as athletics, recreational activities and clubs, counseling, transportation and health services should not be included in the regulations because they may be costly and are usually available on a limited basis.  One commenter stated that it is confusing to include related services in the examples of nonacademic services and recommended that they be removed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The list of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in Sec. 300.107(b) is not exhaustive.  The list provides public agencies with examples of services and activities that may afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in the services offered to other children of the public agency.  We disagree that the list of activities causes confusion with related services, as we think that the public can easily recognize the difference between academic counseling services, for example, that are offered to all children, and the type of counseling services that might be included in a child's IEP as a related service.  For these reasons, we believe it is appropriate to maintain the list of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in Sec. 300.107, including those services that are also related services in Sec. 300.34. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Physical education (Sec. 300.108)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C832%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that, in some States, physical education is not required for every nondisabled child every year and this creates situations in which children with disabilities are in segregated physical education classes.  The commenters recommended that the regulations clarify the requirements for public agencies to make physical education available to children with disabilities when physical education is not available to children without disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.108 describes two considerations that a public agency must take into account to meet the physical education requirements in this section.  First, physical education must be made available equally to children with disabilities and children without disabilities.  If physical education is not available to all children (i.e., children with and without disabilities), the public agency is not required to make physical education available for children with disabilities (e.g., a district may provide physical education to all children through grade 10, but not to any children in their junior and senior years).  Second, if physical education is specially designed to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability and is set out in that child's IEP, those services must be provided whether or not they are provided to other children in the agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
This is the Department's longstanding interpretation of the requirements in Sec. 300.108 and is based on legislative history that the intent of Congress was to ensure equal rights for children with disabilities.  The regulation as promulgated in 1977 was based on an understanding that physical education was available to all children without disabilities and, therefore, must be made available to all children with disabilities.  As stated in H. Rpt. No. 94-332, p. 9, (1975):</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Special education as set forth in the Committee bill includes instruction in physical education, which is provided as a matter of course to all non-handicapped children enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools.  The Committee is concerned that although these services are available to and required of all children in our school systems, they are often viewed as a luxury for handicapped children.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We agree that Sec. 300.108(a) could be interpreted to mean that physical education must be made available to all children with disabilities, regardless of whether physical education is provided to children without disabilities.  We will, therefore, revise paragraph (a) to clarify that the public agency has no obligation to provide physical education for children with disabilities if it does not provide physical education to nondisabled children attending their schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.110 to require States to ensure that each public agency have in effect policies, procedures, and programs to provide children with disabilities the variety of educational programs and services available to nondisabled children.  The commenters stated that Sec. 300.110 does not provide any guidance to educators.  A few commenters stated that "vocational education is an outdated term" and proposed replacing it with "career-technical and adult education" or "career and technical education."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change Sec. 300.110.  Under this provision, States must ensure that public agencies take steps to ensure that children with disabilities have access to the same program options that are available to nondisabled children in the area served by the agency, whatever those options are, and we are not aware of any implementation problems with this requirement.  We believe that it is important that educators understand that children with disabilities must have access to the same range of programs and services that a public agency provides to nondisabled children and that the regulation conveys this point.  We also do not believe it is necessary to replace the term "vocational education" with the language recommended by the commenter.  The term is broad in its meaning and generally accepted and understood in the field and, therefore, would encompass such areas as "career-technical" and "technical education."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested that the regulations explicitly state that a child with a disability who has not yet received a regular high school diploma or "aged out" of special education may participate in dual enrollment programs and receive services in a postsecondary or community-based setting if the IEP Team decides it is appropriate.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.110, consistent with section 612(a)(2) of the Act, requires States to ensure that public agencies take steps to ensure that children with disabilities have access to the same program options that are available to nondisabled children in the area served by the agency.  This would apply to dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings.  Therefore, a State would be responsible for ensuring that a public agency that offered dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings to a nondisabled student would have that option available to a student with disabilities whose IEP Team determined that such a program would best meet the student's needs.  However, we do not believe that the Act requires public agencies to provide dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings for students with disabilities, if such programs are not available to nondisabled secondary school students.  Therefore, we are not modifying the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department does not believe it is necessary to retain the language in current Sec. 300.125(c).  The child find requirements in Sec. 300.111 have traditionally been interpreted to mean identifying and evaluating children beginning at birth.  While child find under Part C of the Act overlaps, in part, with child find under Part B of the Act, the coordination of child find activities under Part B and Part C is an implementation matter that is best left to each State.  Nothing in the Act or these regulations prohibits a Part C lead agency's participation, with the agreement of the SEA, in the actual implementation of child find activities for infants and toddlers with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The changes requested by the commenter cannot be made because they are inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.111(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act, explicitly requires that all children with disabilities residing in the State are identified, located, and evaluated.  This includes children suspected of having developmental delays, as defined in section 602(3)(B) of the Act.  We recognize that it is difficult to locate, identify, and evaluate highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities.  However, we strongly believe it is important to stress in these regulations that the States' child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 apply equally to such children.  We also believe it is important to clarify that a child suspected of having a disability but who has not failed, is making academic progress, and is passing from grade to grade must be considered in the child find process as any other child suspected of having a disability.  As noted earlier in the discussion regarding Sec. 300.101, paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 300.111 has been revised to clarify that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.114, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, requires each public agency to ensure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who are not disabled.

Comment:  A number of comments were received regarding Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(ii), which requires each public agency to ensure that the removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that the education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  Many commenters recommended replacing "regular educational environment" with "regular classroom" because "regular classroom" is less likely to be misinterpreted to mean any kind of contact with children without disabilities.  A few commenters expressed concern that using the phrase "regular educational environment" weakens the LRE protections.  Another commenter recommended the regulations clarify that the "regular educational environment" means the participation of children with disabilities with their nondisabled peers in regular classrooms and other educational settings including nonacademic settings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.114(a)(2)(ii) follows the specific language in section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act and reflects previous regulatory language.  This requirement is longstanding.

Discussion:  The additional language requested by the commenter is not necessary and would impose unwarranted paperwork burdens on schools.  Section 300.320(a)(5), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(V) of the Act, already requires a child's IEP to include an explanation of the extent, if any, to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in the regular class.  As noted previously, parents are a part of the group making placement decisions.  We believe these provisions provide sufficient safeguards on the placement process. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the LRE requirements are often misinterpreted to be a mandate to include all children who are deaf or hard of hearing in their local schools.  The commenter stated that the placement decision for a child who is deaf or hard of hearing should be based on the child's communication needs and must be the environment that presents the fewest language and communication barriers to the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development.  Some commenters cautioned that inclusive settings might be inappropriate for a child who is deaf and who requires communication support and stated that the LRE should be the place where a child can be educated successfully.  A few commenters requested the regulations clarify that all placement options must remain available for children who are deaf.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended strengthening the requirement for a continuum of alternative placements and stated that a full range of placement options is necessary to meet the needs of all children with visual impairments.  Another commenter urged the Department to ensure that children with low-incidence disabilities (including children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind) have access to appropriate educational programming and services at all times, including center-based schools, which may be the most appropriate setting for children with low-incidence disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.117 express a strong preference, not a mandate, for educating children with disabilities in regular classes alongside their peers without disabilities.  Section 300.114(a)(2), consistent with section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act, requires that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who are not disabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With respect to the recommendation that the placement for children who are deaf or hard of hearing be based on the child's communication needs, Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(iv), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, clarifies that the IEP Team, in developing the IEP for a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, must consider the child's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communication with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, and the child's academic level and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With respect to strengthening the continuum of alternative placement requirements, nothing in the LRE requirements would prevent an IEP Team from making a determination that placement in the local school is not appropriate for a particular child.  Section 300.115 already requires each public agency to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services.  We believe this adequately addresses the commenter's concern.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The process for determining the educational placement for children with low-incidence disabilities (including children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind) is the same process used for determining the educational placement for all children with disabilities.  That is, each child's educational placement must be determined on an individual case-by-case basis depending on each child's unique educational needs and circumstances, rather than by the child's category of disability, and must be based on the child's IEP.  We believe the LRE provisions are sufficient to ensure that public agencies provide low-incidence children with disabilities access to appropriate educational programming and services in the educational setting appropriate to meet the needs of the child in the LRE.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from school are entitled to be educated with children who are not disabled.  The commenter stated that this clarification is necessary to reduce the use of home instruction as a placement option for these children. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not require that children with disabilities suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons continue to be educated with children who are not disabled during the period of their removal.  We believe it is important to ensure that children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from school receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to remove a child from school, when necessary, and to determine how best to address the child's needs during periods of removal and where services are to be provided to the child during such periods of removals, including, if appropriate, home instruction.  Sections 300.530 through 300.536 address the options available to school authorities in disciplining children with disabilities and set forth procedures that must be followed when taking disciplinary actions and in making decisions regarding the educational services that a child will receive and the location in which services will be provided.  We believe including the language recommended by the commenter would adversely restrict the options available to school personnel for disciplining children with disabilities and inadvertently tie the hands of school personnel in responding quickly and effectively to serious child behaviors and in creating safe classrooms for all children. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.114(b) incorporates the language from section 612(a)(5)(B) of the Act and prohibits States from maintaining funding mechanisms that violate the LRE provisions.  We do not believe it is necessary to provide additional clarification in the regulations.  While we agree with the commenter that note 89 of the Conf. Rpt. makes clear Congress' intent that State funding mechanisms support the LRE requirements and do not provide an incentive or disincentive for certain placement decisions, we believe the requirements in Sec. 300.114(b) accurately capture the essence of the Conf.

Comment:  One commenter urged the Department to impose financial sanctions on States that continue to base their funding on certain placement decisions.  A few commenters suggested changing the requirement in Sec. 300.114(b)(2) for States to provide an assurance that the State will revise its funding mechanism "as soon as feasible" to "no later than the start of the 2006-2007 school year."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.114(b)(2) incorporates the language in section 612(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act, and requires that if a State does not have policies and procedures to ensure that the State's funding mechanism does not violate the LRE requirements, the State must provide the Secretary an assurance that the State will revise its funding mechanism as soon as feasible.  We do not believe it is necessary to include in these regulations a specific timeline for a State to revise its funding mechanism, if required to do so pursuant to 300.114(b)(2).  We believe the statutory language "as soon as feasible," while providing flexibility as to how each State meets the requirement, is sufficient to ensure States' compliance with this requirement. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Further, we believe the enforcement options in Sec. 300.604 give the Secretary sufficient means to address a State's noncompliance with the requirements in Sec. 300.114(b)(2).  Section 300.604 describes the enforcement options available to the Secretary if the Secretary determines that a State needs assistance or intervention implementing the requirements of Part B of the Act, or that there is a substantial failure to comply with any condition of an SEA's or LEA's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Enforcement options available to the Secretary include, among others, recovery of funds or withholding, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under Part B of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to include the language suggested by the commenter, because Sec. 300.116 is sufficiently clear that placement decisions must be based on the individual needs of each child with a disability.

Discussion:  The issues raised by the commenters are already addressed elsewhere in the regulations.

In addition, Sec. 300.323(c)(2) requires that, as soon as possible following the development of an IEP, special education and related services are made available to the child in accordance with the child's IEP.

Comment:  One commenter stated that the placement requirements in Sec. 300.116 encourage school districts to assign a child with a disability to a particular place or setting, rather than providing a continuum of increasingly individualized and intensive services.  The commenter suggested requiring that the continuum of alternative placements include a progressively more intensive level of individualized, scientifically based instruction and related services, both with increased time and lower pupil-teacher ratio, in addition to regular instruction with supplementary aids and services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Because placement decisions must be determined on an individual case-by-case basis depending on each child's unique educational needs and circumstances and based on the child's IEP, we do not believe it is appropriate to require in the regulations that the continuum of alternative placements include a progressively more intensive level of individualized scientifically based instruction and related services as suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  We received a number of comments regarding the phrase, "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c).  As proposed, Sec. 300.116(b)(3) requires the child's placement to be as close as possible to the child's home, "unless the parent agrees otherwise;" and Sec. 300.116(c) requires that, unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement, the child must be educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled, "unless the parent agrees otherwise."  Many commenters requested removing the phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise," because it is not included in section 612(a)(5) of the Act and is not necessary to clarify that a parent may place his or her child in a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE requirements.  Other commenters suggested removing the phrase and clarifying that a decision by the child's parent to send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school is not a violation of the LRE requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters stated that including the phrase undermines the statutory requirement for children with disabilities to be placed in the LRE based on their IEPs and allows more restrictive placements based on parental choice.  Many commenters interpreted this phrase to mean that placement is a matter of parental choice even in public school settings and stated that a child's LRE rights should not be overridden by parental choice.  One commenter stated that the phrase might intimidate parents into accepting inappropriate placements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters stated that this phrase is unnecessary because the Act already requires parents to be involved in placement decisions, and expressed concern that including this phrase in the regulations could lead to confusion and litigation.  One commenter stated that the phrase suggests that additional consent is required if the parent chooses to send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c) was added to clarify that a parent may send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE mandate.  A parent has always had this option; a parent who chooses this option for the child does not violate the LRE mandate as long as the child is educated with his or her peers without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate.  However, we agree that this phrase is unnecessary, confusing, and may be misunderstood to mean that parents have a right to veto the placement decision made by the group of individuals in Sec. 300.116(a)(1).  We will, therefore, remove the phrase. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter disagreed with the requirement in Sec. 300.116(b)(3) that placements be as close as possible to the child's home, stating that the requirement is administratively prohibitive and beyond the scope of the Act.  The commenter stated that it is not possible for school districts to provide classes for children with all types and degrees of disabilities in each school building.  The commenter stated that "placement" should be understood as the set of services outlined in a child's IEP, and recommended that school districts be permitted to provide these services in the school building that is most administratively feasible.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Although the Act does not require that each school building in an LEA be able to provide all the special education and related services for all types and severities of disabilities, the LEA has an obligation to make available a full continuum of alternative placement options that maximize opportunities for its children with disabilities to be educated with nondisabled peers to the extent appropriate.  In all cases, placement decisions must be individually determined on the basis of each child's abilities and needs and each child's IEP, and not solely on factors such as category of disability, severity of disability, availability of special education and related services, configuration of the service delivery system, availability of space, or administrative convenience.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarifying the difference, if any, between "placement" and "location."  One commenter recommended requiring the child's IEP to include a detailed explanation of why a child's educational needs cannot be met in the location requested by the parent when the school district opposes the parent's request for services to be provided to the child in the school that the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters suggested requiring a public agency to pay all costs associated with providing FAPE for a child in a private preschool, including paying for tuition, transportation and such special education, related services and supplementary aids and services as the child needs, if an inclusive preschool is the appropriate placement for a child, and there is no inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118 apply to all children with disabilities, including preschool children who are entitled to FAPE.  Public agencies that do not operate programs for preschool children without disabilities are not required to initiate those programs solely to satisfy the LRE requirements of the Act.  Public agencies that do not have an inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports must explore alternative methods to ensure that the LRE requirements are met.  Examples of such alternative methods might include placement options in private preschool programs or other community-based settings.  Paying for the placement of qualified preschool children with disabilities in a private preschool with children without disabilities is one, but not the only, option available to public agencies to meet the LRE requirements.  We believe the regulations should allow public agencies to choose an appropriate option to meet the LRE requirements.  However, if a public agency determines that placement in a private preschool program is necessary as a means of providing special education and related services to a child with a disability, the program must be at no cost to the parent of the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested clarifying that if a child's behavior in the regular classroom significantly impairs the learning of the child or others, that placement would not meet the child's needs and would not be appropriate for that child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

Discussion:  Section 300.117, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, requires that children with disabilities participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities with their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the child.  The Act places great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities are educated, to the maximum extent appropriate, with children who are nondisabled and are included in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities as appropriate to the needs of the child.  We believe the public agency has an obligation to provide a child with a disability with appropriate aids, services, and other supports, as determined by the IEP Team, if necessary to ensure the child's participation in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities.  Therefore, we will clarify in Sec. 300.117 that each public agency must ensure that children with disabilities have the supplementary aids and services determined necessary by the child's IEP Team for the child to participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department intends the term "training," as used in Sec. 300.119, to have its generally accepted meaning.  Training is generally agreed to be any activity used to enhance one's skill or knowledge to acquire, maintain, and advance knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Given the general understanding of the term "training," we do not believe it is necessary to regulate on this matter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Children With Disabilities Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
General comments</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many comments were received regarding the parentally-placed private school children with disabilities requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144.  Many commenters supported the changes to the regulations and believed the regulations simplify the processes for both private schools and public schools. Numerous commenters, however, expressed concern regarding the implementation of the private school requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Many of the commenters expressed concern with the requirement that the LEAs where private elementary schools and secondary schools are located are now responsible for child find, individual evaluations, and the provision of services for children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools located in the LEA.  These commenters described the private school provisions in the Act and the NPRM as burdensome and difficult to understand.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The revisions to the Act in 2004 significantly changed the obligation of States and LEAs to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  Section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act now requires LEAs in which the private schools are located, rather than the LEAs in which the parents of such children reside, to conduct child find and provide equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Act provides that, in calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds under Part B of the Act that must be spent on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, the LEAs where the private schools are located, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private elementary schools and secondary schools and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, must conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEAs.  In addition, the obligation of the LEA to spend a proportionate amount of funds to provide services to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools is now based on the total number of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools located in the LEA whether or not the children and their parents reside in the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe these regulations and the additional clarification provided in our responses to comments on Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 will help States and LEAs to better understand their obligations in serving children with disabilities placed by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  In addition, the Department has provided additional guidance on implementing the parentally-placed private school requirements on the Department's Web site.  We also are including in these regulations Appendix B to Part 300-Proportionate Share Calculation to assist LEAs in calculating the proportionate amount of Part B funds that they must expend on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities attending private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a reference to Appendix B in Sec. 300.133(b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 include requirements that go beyond the Act and recommended that any requirement beyond what is statutory be removed from these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In general, the regulations track the language in section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act regarding children enrolled in private schools by their parents.  However, we determined that including clarification of the statutory language on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in these regulations would be helpful.  The volume of comments received concerning this topic confirm the need to regulate in order to clarify the statutory language and to help ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested that the regulations provide flexibility to States to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond what they would be able to do with the proportionate share required under the Act.  A few of these commenters requested that those States already providing an individual entitlement to special education and related services or providing a full range of special education services to parentally-placed private school children be deemed to have met the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 and be permitted to continue the State's current practices.  One commenter specifically recommended allowing States that provide additional rights or services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (including FAPE under section 612 of the Act and the procedural safeguards under section 615 of the Act), the option of requesting that the Secretary consider alternate compliance with these requirements that would include evidence and supporting documentation of alternate procedures under State law to meet all the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters requested that the child find and equitable participation requirements should not apply in States with dual enrollment provisions where children with disabilities who are parentally-placed in private elementary schools or secondary schools are also enrolled in public schools for special education and have IEPs and retain their due process rights.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act in no way prohibits States or LEAs from spending additional State or local funds to provide special education or related services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in excess of those required in Sec. 300.133 and section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, consistent with State law or administrative procedures.  The Act, however, does not provide the Secretary with the authority to waive, in whole or in part, the parentally-placed private school requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for States or LEAs that spend State or local funds to provide special education or related services beyond those required under Part B of the Act.  The Secretary, therefore, cannot consider alternative compliance with the parentally-placed private school provisions in the Act and these regulations or consider States and LEAs that use State and local funds to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond the required proportionate share of Federal Part B funds, including providing FAPE to such children, to have met the statutory and regulatory requirements governing parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  States and LEAs must meet the requirements in the Act and these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern regarding the applicability of the child find and equitable participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for children with disabilities who reside in one State and are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools located in another State.  These commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether the LEA in the State where the private elementary school or secondary school is located or the LEA in the State where the child resides is responsible for conducting child find (including individual evaluations and reevaluations), and providing and paying for equitable services for children who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act provides that the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, after timely and meaningful consultation with private school representatives, is responsible for conducting the child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA.  We believe this responsibility includes child find for children who reside in other States but who attend private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act is clear about which LEA is responsible for child find and the Act does not provide an exception for children who reside in one State and attend private elementary schools and secondary schools in other States.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, in consultation with private school officials and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, also is responsible for determining and paying for the services to be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  We believe this responsibility extends to children from other States who are enrolled in a private school located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act clarifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for spending a proportionate amount of its Federal Part B funds on special education and related services for children enrolled by their parents in the private schools located in the LEA.  The Act does not provide an exception for out-of-State children with disabilities attending a private school located in the LEA and, therefore, out-of-State children with disabilities must be included in the group of parentally-placed children with disabilities whose needs are considered in determining which parentally-placed private school children with disabilities will be served and the types and amounts of services to be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (f) to Sec. 300.131 clarifying that each LEA where private, including religious, elementary schools and secondary schools are located must, in carrying out the child find requirements in this section, include parentally-placed private school children who reside in the State other than where the private schools they attend are located.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended the regulations clarify the LEA's obligation under Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 regarding child find and equitable participation for children from other countries enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools by their parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The obligation to consider children with disabilities for equitable services extends to all children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled by their parents in private schools within each LEA's jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended the regulations clarify the applicability of the child find and equitable participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for children with disabilities, aged three through five, enrolled by their parents in private preschools or day care programs.  Many commenters recommended the regulations clarify that preschool children with disabilities should be counted in determining the proportionate share of funds available to serve children enrolled in private elementary schools by their parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a private preschool or day care program is considered an elementary school, as defined in Sec. 300.13, the child find and equitable services participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, consistent with section 612(a)(10) of the Act, apply to children with disabilities aged three through five enrolled by their parents in such programs.  Section 300.13, consistent with section 602(6) of the Act, defines an elementary school as a nonprofit institutional day or residential school, including a public elementary charter school, which provides elementary education, as determined under State law.  We believe it is important to clarify in the regulations that children aged three through five are considered parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools only if they are enrolled in private schools that meet the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new Sec. 300.133(a)(2)(ii) to clarify that children aged three through five are considered to be parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, including religious, elementary schools, if they are enrolled in a private school that meets the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13.</p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended removing "or facilities" from the definition of parentally-placed private school children because it is not defined in the Act or the regulations.  Another commenter recommended including a definition of "facilities."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, the obligation to conduct child find and provide equitable services extends to children who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This obligation also applies to children who have been enrolled by their parents in private facilities if those facilities are elementary schools or secondary schools, as defined in subpart A of the regulations.  Because facilities that meet the definition of elementary school or secondary school are covered under this section, we believe it is important to retain the reference to facilities in these regulations.  We will, however, revise Sec. 300.130 to clarify that children with disabilities who are enrolled by their parents in facilities that meet the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13 or secondary school in new Sec. 300.36 (proposed Sec. 300.35) would be considered parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.130 has been revised to clarify that parentally-placed private school children with disabilities means children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, including religious, schools or facilities that meet the definition of an elementary school in Sec. 300.13 or secondary school in Sec. 300.36.</p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended permitting the LEA where private schools are located to request reimbursement from the LEA where the child resides for the cost of conducting an individual evaluation, as may be required under the child find requirements in Sec. 300.131.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that the LEA where private schools are located be responsible for locating and identifying children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools and the LEA where the children reside be responsible for conducting individual evaluations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.131, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools in which the child is enrolled are located, not the LEA where the child resides, is responsible for conducting child find, including an individual evaluation for a child with a disability enrolled by the child's parent in a private elementary school or secondary school located in the LEA.  The Act specifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting both the child find process and the initial evaluation.  Therefore, the LEA where private schools are located may not seek reimbursement from the LEA of residence for the cost of conducting the evaluation or to request that the LEA of residence conduct the evaluation.  However, the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located has options as to how it meets its responsibilities.  For example, the LEA may assume the responsibility itself, contract with another public agency (including the public agency of residence), or make other arrangements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended permitting a parent who enrolled a child in a private elementary school or secondary school the option of not participating in child find required under Sec. 300.131.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(e)(4) clarifies that parents who enroll their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools have the option of not participating in an LEA's child find activities required under Sec. 300.131.  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart D, once parents opt out of the public schools, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children as they do for children enrolled in public schools, in light of the public agencies' obligation to educate public school children with disabilities.  We further indicate in the discussion of subpart D that we have added new Sec. 300.300(e)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.300(d)) to clarify that if the parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the child's parent at the parent's own expense does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or reevaluation, the public agency may not use the due process procedures in section 615 of the Act and the public agency is not required to consider the child for equitable services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended permitting amounts expended for child find, including individual evaluations, to be deducted from the required amount of funds to be expended on equitable services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requested changes would be inconsistent with the Act.  There is a distinction under the Act between the obligation to conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, and the obligation to use an amount of funds equal to a proportionate amount of the Federal Part B grant flowing to LEAs to provide special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  The obligation to conduct child find for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, is independent of the services provision.  Further, Sec. 300.131(d), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IV) of the Act, clarifies that the costs of child find activities for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether the LEA has spent an appropriate amount on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarifying whether an LEA may exclude children suspected of having certain disabilities, such as those with specific learning disabilities, in conducting individual evaluations of suspected children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located must identify and evaluate all children suspected of having disabilities as defined under section 602(3) of the Act.  LEAs may not exclude children suspected of having certain disabilities, such as those with specific learning disabilities, from their child find activities.  The Department recommends that LEAs and private elementary schools and secondary schools consult on how best to implement the State's evaluation criteria and the requirements under this part for identifying children with specific learning disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents.  This is explained in more detail in the discussion of comments under Sec. 300.307.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that parents who place their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools outside the district of residence, and who are determined by the LEA where the private schools are located, through its child find process, to be children with disabilities eligible for special education and related services, would have no knowledge of the special education and related services available for their children if they choose to attend a public school in their district of residence.  A few commenters suggested clarifying the obligation of the LEA where the private school is located to provide the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally-placed private school child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended that the parent of a child with a disability identified through the child find process in Sec. 300.131 be provided with information regarding an appropriate educational program for the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act is silent on the obligation of officials of the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools are located to share personally identifiable information, such as individual evaluation information, with officials of the LEA of the parent's residence.  We believe that the LEA where the private schools are located has an obligation to protect the privacy of children placed in private schools by their parents.  We believe that when a parentally-placed private school child is evaluated and identified as a child with a disability by the LEA in which the private school is located, parental consent should be required before such personally identifiable information is released to officials of the LEA of the parent's residence.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to make this clear.  We explain this revision in more detail in the discussion of comments under Sec. 300.622.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe the regulations adequately ensure that parents of children enrolled in private schools by their parents, who are identified as children with disabilities through the child find process, receive information regarding an appropriate educational program for their children.  Section 300.138(b) provides that each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated to receive equitable services must have a services plan that describes the specific education and related services that the LEA where the private school is located has determined it will make available to the child and the services plan must, to the extent appropriate, meet the IEP content, development, review and revision requirements described in section 614(d) of the Act, or, when appropriate, for children aged three through five, the IFSP requirements described in section 636(d) of the Act as to the services that are to be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Furthermore, the LEA where the private school is located must, pursuant to Sec. 300.504(a) and section 615(d) of the Act, provide the parent a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon conducting the initial evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to require parental consent for the disclosure of records of parentally-placed private school children between LEAs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.131 does not address which LEA has the responsibility for reevaluations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting reevaluations of children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools located within the LEA.  Reevaluation is a part of the LEA's child find responsibility for parentally-placed private school children under section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the regulations permit a parent to request an evaluation from the LEA of residence at the same time the child is being evaluated by the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located, resulting in two LEAs simultaneously conducting evaluations of the same child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested the regulations clarify which LEA (the LEA of residence or the LEA where the private elementary schools or secondary schools are located) is responsible for offering FAPE to children identified through child find under Sec. 300.131 so that parents can make an informed decision regarding their children's education.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a determination is made by the LEA where the private school is located that a child needs special education and related services, the LEA where the child resides is responsible for making FAPE available to the child.  If the parent makes clear his or her intention to keep the child enrolled in the private elementary school or secondary school located in another LEA, the LEA where the child resides need not make FAPE available to the child.  We do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary, as Sec. 300.201 already clarifies that the district of residence is responsible for making FAPE available to the child.  Accordingly, the district in which the private elementary or secondary school is located is not responsible for making FAPE available to a child residing in another district.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarification of the term "activities similar" in Sec. 300.131(c).  Another commenter recommended clarifying that these activities include, but are not limited to, activities relating to evaluations and reevaluations.  One commenter requested that children with disabilities parentally-placed in private schools be identified and evaluated as quickly as possible.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.131(c), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(III) of the Act, requires that, in carrying out child find for parentally-placed private school children, SEAs and LEAs must undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for their publicly enrolled or publicly-placed children.  This would generally include, but is not limited to, such activities as widely distributing informational brochures, providing regular public service announcements, staffing exhibits at health fairs and other community activities, and creating direct liaisons with private schools.  Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.  In addition, evaluations of all children suspected of having disabilities under Part B of the Act, regardless of whether they are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools, must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311, consistent with section 614(a) through (c) of the Act, which describes the procedures for evaluations and reevaluations for all children with disabilities.  We believe the phrase "activities similar" is understood by SEAs and LEAs and, therefore, it is not necessary to regulate on the meaning of the phrase.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters expressed confusion regarding which LEA is responsible for paying for the equitable services provided to a parentally-placed private elementary school or secondary school child, the district of the child's residence or the LEA where the private school is located.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.133, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, is sufficiently clear that the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located is responsible for paying for the equitable services provided to a parentally-placed private elementary school or secondary school child.  These provisions provide that the LEA where the private elementary and secondary schools are located must spend a proportionate amount of its Federal funds available under Part B of the Act for services for children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.  The Act does not permit an exception to this requirement.  No further clarification is needed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended the regulations clarify which LEA in the State is responsible for providing equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities who attend a private school that straddles two LEAs in the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not address situations where a private school straddles more than one LEA.  However, the Act does specify that the LEA in which the private school is located is responsible for providing special education to children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents, consistent with the number of such children and their needs.  In situations where more than one LEA potentially could assume the responsibility of providing equitable services, the SEA, consistent with its general supervisory responsibility, determines which LEA in the State is responsible for ensuring the equitable participation of children with disabilities attending that private school.  We do not believe that the situation is common enough to warrant a change in the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested requiring in Sec. 300.132(c) that data on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities be submitted to the Department.  Another commenter agreed, stating that the data should be submitted the same day as the annual child count.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The purpose of the child count under Sec. 300.132(c) is to determine the amount of Federal funds that the LEA must spend on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in the next fiscal year.  We are not requiring States to submit these data to the Department as the Department does not have a programmatic or regulatory need to collect this information at this time.  Section 300.644 permits the SEA to include in its annual report of children served those parentally-placed private school children who are eligible under the Act and receive special education or related services.  We believe this is sufficient to meet the Department's need to collect data on this group of children and we do not wish to place an unnecessary data collection and paperwork burden on States.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested the regulations clarify whether an LEA must spend its entire proportionate share for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities by the end of a fiscal year or could carry over any remaining funds into the next fiscal year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter that a provision should be included in these regulations to clarify that, if an LEA has not expended for equitable services all of the proportionate amount of Federal funds to be provided for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities by the end of the fiscal year for which Congress appropriated the funds, the LEA must obligate the remaining funds for special education and related services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities during a carry-over period of one additional year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It has come to our attention that there is some confusion among States and LEAs between the count of the number of children with disabilities receiving special education and related services as required under section 618 of the Act, and the requirement under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act that each LEA conduct an annual count of the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities attending private schools in the LEA.  We will, therefore, revise the heading (child count) for Sec. 300.133(c) and the regulatory language in Sec. 300.133(c) to avoid any confusion regarding the requirements in paragraph (c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.133(c) has been revised as described above.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter interpreted Sec. 300.133(d) to require that:  (1) LEAs provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities with funds provided under the Act and (2) LEAs no longer have the option of using local funds equal to, and in lieu of, the Federal pro-rated share amount.  This commenter recommended that LEAs continue to be allowed to use local funds for administrative convenience.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter's interpretation is correct.  The Act added the supplement, not supplant requirement in section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), which is included in Sec. 300.133(d).  This requirement provides that State and local funds may supplement, but in no case supplant the proportionate amount of the Federal Part B funds that must be expended under this provision.  Prior to the change in the Act, if a State was spending more than the Federal proportional share of funds from State or local funds, then the State would not have to spend any Federal Part B funds.  That is no longer permissible under the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Whether home-schooled children with disabilities are considered parentally-placed private school children with disabilities is a matter left to State law.

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring, in Sec. 300.134(e), that the LEA include, in its written explanation to the private school, its reason whenever:  (1) the LEA does not provide services by a professional directly employed by that LEA to parentally-placed private school children with a disability when requested to do so by private school officials; and (2) the LEA does not provide services through a third party provider when requested to do so by the private school officials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.134(e) incorporates the language from section 612(a)(10)(A)(iii)(V) of the Act and requires the LEA to provide private school officials with a written explanation of the reasons why the LEA chose not to provide services directly or through contract.  We do not believe that the additional language suggested by the commenter is necessary because we view the statutory language as sufficient to ensure that the LEA meets its obligation to provide private school officials a written explanation of any reason why the LEA chose not to provide services directly or through a contract.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended requiring LEAs to forward the written affirmation to the SEA, because this information is important for the SEA to exercise adequate oversight over LEAs with respect to the participation of private school officials in the consultation process.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.135, regarding written affirmation, tracks the language in section 612(a)(10)(A)(iv) of the Act.  Including a requirement in the regulations that the LEA must submit a copy of signed written affirmations to the SEA would place reporting burdens on the LEA that are not required by the Act and that we do not believe are warranted in this circumstance.  We expect that in most circumstances private school officials and LEAs will have cooperative relationships that will not need State involvement.  If private school officials believe that there was not meaningful consultation, they may raise that issue with the SEA through the procedures in Sec. 300.136.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude a State from requiring LEAs to submit a copy of the written affirmation obtained pursuant to Sec. 300.135, in meeting its general supervision responsibilities under Sec. 300.149 or as a part of its monitoring of LEAs' implementation of Part B of the Act as required in Sec. 300.600.  Consistent with Sec. 300.199(a)(2) and section 608(a)(2) of the Act, a State that chooses to require its LEAs to submit copies of written affirmations to the SEA beyond what is required in Sec. 300.135 would have to identify, in writing, to the LEAs located in the State and to the Secretary, that such rule, regulation, or policy is a State-imposed requirement that is not required by Part B of the Act or these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.136 to permit an LEA to submit a complaint to the State if private school officials do not engage in meaningful consultation with the LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.136, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(v) of the Act, provides that a private school official has the right to complain to the SEA that the LEA did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official.  The provisions in the Act and the regulations apply to the responsibilities of the SEA and its LEAs and not to private schools or entities.  Because the requirements of the Act do not apply to private schools, we do not believe requiring SEAs to permit an LEA to submit a complaint to the SEA alleging that representatives of the private schools did not consult in a meaningful way with the LEA would serve a meaningful purpose.  The equitable services made available under Part B of the Act are a benefit to the parentally-placed private school children and not services provided to the private schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.136 to allow States to determine the most appropriate procedures for a private school official to submit a complaint to the SEA that an LEA did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school officials.  Many of these commenters stated that requiring such complaints be filed pursuant to the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 is not required by the Act and recommended we remove this requirement. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that section 612(a)(10)(A)(v) of the Act does not stipulate how a private school official must submit a complaint to the SEA that the LEA did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official.  We also agree with the commenters that the SEA should have flexibility to determine how such complaints will be filed with the State.  We will, therefore, revise Sec. 300.136(a) to remove the requirement that private school officials must file a complaint with the SEA under the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.  States may, if they so choose, use their State complaint procedures under Sec.

Discussion:  Section 300.137(a) reflects the Department's longstanding policy, consistent with section 612(a)(10) of the Act, and explicitly provides that children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents have no individual entitlement to receive some or all of the special education and related services they would receive if enrolled in the public schools.  Under the Act, LEAs only have an obligation to provide parentally-placed private school children with disabilities an opportunity for equitable participation in the services funded with Federal Part B funds that the LEA has determined, after consultation, to make available to its population of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.

Comment:  Several commenters requested clarifying whether the requirement in Sec. 300.138(a) that services provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities be provided by personnel meeting the same standards (i.e., highly qualified teacher requirements) as personnel providing services in the public schools applies to private school teachers who are contracted by the LEA to provide equitable services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As discussed in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section, in the response to comments on Sec. 300.18, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified special education teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  Further, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified special education teacher requirements also do not apply to private school teachers who provide equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In addition to the revision we are making to new Sec. 300.18(h) (proposed Sec. 300.18(g)) to make this position clear, we also will revise Sec. 300.138(a)(1) to clarify that private elementary school and secondary school teachers who are providing equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities do not have to meet the highly qualified special education teacher requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested clarifying the process for developing a services plan and explaining how a services plan differs from an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that additional explanation in the regulation is needed.  Under Sec. 300.138(b), each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated by the LEA in which the private school is located to receive special education or related services must have a services plan.  The services plan must describe the specific special education and related services offered to a parentally-placed private school child with a disability designated to receive services.  The services plan also must, to the extent appropriate, meet the IEP content, development, review, and revision requirements described in section 614(d) of the Act, or, when appropriate, for children aged three through five, the IFSP requirements described in section 636(d) of the Act as to the services that are to be provided.  The LEA must ensure that a representative of the private school attends each meeting to develop the services plan and if the representative cannot attend, use other methods to ensure participation by the private school, including individual or conference telephone calls.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Children with disabilities enrolled in public schools or who are publicly-placed in private schools are entitled to FAPE and must receive the full range of services under Part B of the Act that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary to meet the child's individual needs and provide FAPE.  The IEPs for these children generally will be more comprehensive than the more limited services plans developed for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities designated to receive services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended revising the definition of services plan to clarify that an IEP could serve as the services plan; otherwise, States that provide IEP services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities would be required to develop a services plan and an IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to clarify in the regulations that the IEP can serve as the services plan because, as stated elsewhere in this preamble, a services plan should only describe the specific special education and related services offered to a parentally-placed private school child with a disability designated to receive services.  We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.  There is nothing, however, in these regulations that would prevent a State that provides more services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities than they are required to do under the Act to use an IEP in place of a services plan, consistent with State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Further, Sec. 300.137(b)(2) clarifies that, after this consultation process, the final decision with respect to the services provided to eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities is made by the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended specifying that providing services on the premises of private elementary schools and secondary schools is the preferred means of serving parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  A few commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.139(a) to stipulate that services "should" or "must" be provided on the premises of private schools, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  In contrast, several commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the NPRM that services should be provided on-site unless there is a compelling rationale to provide services off-site.  A few of these commenters stated that the Act does not indicate a preference for one location of services over another and the Department has no authority to provide such a strong comment on this issue.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Services offered to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may be provided on-site at a child's private school, including a religious school, to the extent consistent with law, or at another location.  The Department believes, in the interests of the child, LEAs should provide services on site at the child's private school so as not to unduly disrupt the child's educational experience, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  The phrase "to the extent consistent with law" is in section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act.  We interpret this language to mean that the provision of services on the premises of a private school takes place in a manner that would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would not be inconsistent with applicable State constitutions or law.  We, therefore, do not have the statutory authority to require that services be provided on-site.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that Sec. 300.139(b), regarding transportation services, goes beyond the requirements in the Act and should be removed.  A few commenters stated that transportation is a related service and should be treated as such with respect to parentally-placed children with disabilities in private schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that transportation services should be removed from Sec. 300.139(b).  If services are offered at a site separate from the child's private school, transportation may be necessary to get the child to and from that other site.  Failure to provide transportation could effectively deny the child an opportunity to benefit from the services that the LEA has determined through consultation to offer its parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In this situation, although transportation is not a related service, as defined in Sec. 300.34, transportation is necessary to enable the child to participate and to make the offered services accessible to the child.  LEAs should work in consultation with representatives of private school children to ensure that services are provided at sites, including on the premises of the child's private school, so that LEAs do not incur significant transportation costs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, for some children with disabilities, special modifications in transportation may be necessary to address the child's unique needs.  If the group developing the child's services plan determines that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability chosen to receive services requires transportation as a related service in order to receive special education services, this transportation service should be included as a related service in the services plan for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In either case, the LEA may include the cost of the transportation in calculating whether it has met the requirement of Sec. 300.133. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Due process complaints and State complaints (Sec. 300.140) <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1090%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that the right of parents of children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools to file a due process complaint against an LEA is limited to filing a due process complaint that an LEA has failed to comply with the child find and evaluation requirements, and not an LEA's failure to provide special education and related services as required in the services plan.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether the parent should file a due process complaint with the LEA of residence or with the LEA where the private school is located. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(a) of the Act specifies that the procedural safeguards of the Act apply with respect to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or provision of FAPE to children with disabilities.  The special education and related services provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities are independent of the obligation to make FAPE available to these children.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
While there may be legitimate issues regarding the provision of services to a particular parentally-placed private school child with a disability an LEA has agreed to serve, the due process provisions in section 615 of the Act and Sec. Sec. 300.504 through 300.519 do not apply to these disputes, because there is no individual right to these services under the Act.  Disputes that arise about these services are properly subject to the State complaint procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Child find, however, is a part of the basic obligation that public agencies have to all children with disabilities, and failure to locate, identify, and evaluate a parentally-placed private school child would be subject to due process.  Therefore, the due process provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.504 through 300.519 do apply to complaints that the LEA where the private school is located failed to meet the consent and evaluation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 311. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In light of the comments received, we will clarify in Sec. 300.140 that parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may file a due process complaint with the LEA in which the private school is located (and forward a copy to the SEA) regarding an LEA's failure to meet the consent and evaluation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311.  We also will clarify that a complaint can be filed with the SEA under the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that the SEA or LEA has failed to meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.132 through 300.135 and Sec. Sec. 300.137 through 300.144.  There would be an exception, however, for complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 300.136.  Complaints under Sec. 300.136 must be filed in accordance with the procedures established by each State under Sec. 300.136.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Proposed Sec. 300.140(a)(2) has been redesignated as new paragraph (b).  A new paragraph (b)(2) has been added to this section to clarify that any due process complaint regarding the evaluation requirements in Sec. 300.131 must be filed with the LEA in which the private school is located, and a copy must be forwarded to the SEA.  Proposed Sec. 300.140(b) has been redesignated as new paragraph (c), and has been revised to clarify that a complaint that the SEA or LEA has failed to meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.132 through 300.135 and Sec. Sec. 300.137 through 300.144 can be filed with the SEA under the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.

Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(vi)(I) of the Act, equitable services must be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by the public agency with an individual, association, agency, organization, or other entity.  Section 300.142(a) provides that an LEA may use Part B funds to make public school personnel available in other than public facilities to the extent necessary to provide equitable services for parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools and if those services are not otherwise provided by the private school to children as a benefit provided to all children attending that school.  Under Sec. 300.142(b), an LEA may use Part B funds to pay for the services of an employee of a private school to provide equitable services if the employee performs the services outside of his or her regular hours of duty and the employee performs the services under public supervision and control.

Comment:  Many commenters disagreed with the exception to the "highly qualified teacher" requirements in paragraph (b) of this section and stated that the "highly qualified teacher" requirements should apply to private school teachers of children with disabilities placed or referred by public agencies.  Several commenters stated that these children are likely to have more severe disabilities and, therefore, have a greater need for highly qualified teachers than children served in public schools. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that exempting teachers in private schools from the requirement to be "highly qualified" in situations where children with disabilities are publicly-placed in order to receive FAPE is not consistent with the requirement that the education provided to children in such settings meet the standards that apply to children served by public agencies, or with the ESEA and the goal in the Act of helping all children with disabilities achieve high standards.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters supported the exception to "highly qualified teacher" requirements.  One commenter stated that States should make their own decisions in this area in light of resource constraints.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter opposed the expenditure of public school funds for the education of publicly-placed private school children by teachers who do not meet the "highly qualified" requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not agree with the premise of the commenters that not requiring private school teachers who provide services to publicly-placed children with disabilities to meet the highly qualified teacher requirements means that the education provided to these children in the private school setting does not meet the standards that apply to children with disabilities served by the public agency.  States have flexibility in developing standards that meet the requirements of the Act.  The standards that SEAs apply to private schools that contract with public agencies to provide FAPE to children with disabilities, are, so long as they meet the requirements of Part B of the Act and its regulations, a State matter.  Federal law does not encourage or prohibit the imposition of additional requirements as a condition of placing these children in the private school.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment opposing the use of public school funds for the education of publicly-placed private school children by teachers who do not meet the highly qualified teacher requirements, a State or public agency may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private sources of support that are available in the State to meet the requirements of the Act.  We believe restricting the use of public school funds as requested by the commenter would not only be inconsistent with the Act, but also may unnecessarily limit a public agency's options for providing FAPE to its publicly-placed children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring States to have rules, regulations, and contracts requiring private schools that accept publicly-placed children with disabilities to guarantee that children with disabilities receive FAPE and their parents retain all of the protections mandated for public schools, including the right to pendency placements if the parents challenge the decisions of the private school to terminate the children's placements.  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that private schools serving children placed by a public agency are not exempt from the obligation to provide FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that, in cases where the public agency places a child in a private school or residential treatment facility for the purposes of providing FAPE, the public agency should be required to determine and inform the private school or residential treatment facility about the person or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Changes:  Section 300.148 has been revised to include the requirement in current Sec. 300.403(b) that disagreements between a parent and a public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for the child and the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.504 through 300.520.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested revising the regulations to eliminate financial incentives for parents to refer children for special education and then unilaterally placing their child in private schools without first receiving special education and related services from the school district.  The commenter stated that it should be clear that a unilateral placement in a private school without first receiving special education and related services from the LEA does not require the public agency to provide reimbursement for private school tuition.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that proposed Sec. 300.148(b) goes beyond the Act and only applies if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to enrollment in the private school.  The commenter stated that a determination that a placement is "appropriate," even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA or LEAs, conflicts with the SEA's or LEA's responsibility to ensure FAPE to children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.148(b) that a parental placement does not need to meet State standards in order to be "appropriate" under the Act is retained from current Sec. 300.402(c) to be consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985) (Burlington) and Florence County School District Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (Carter).  Under the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, a court may order reimbursement for a parent who unilaterally withdraws his or her child from a public school that provides an inappropriate education under the Act and enrolls the child in a private school that provides an education that is otherwise proper under the Act, but does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.  The Court noted that these standards apply only to public agencies' own programs for educating children with disabilities and to public agency placements of children with disabilities in private schools for the purpose of providing a program of special education and related services.  The Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Burlington that tuition reimbursement is only available if a Federal court concludes "both that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school placement was proper under the Act."  (510 U.S. at 12).  We believe LEAs can avoid reimbursement awards by offering and providing FAPE consistent with the Act either in public schools or in private schools in which the parent places the child.  However, a decision as to whether an LEA's offer or provision of FAPE was proper under the Act and any decision regarding reimbursement must be made by a court or hearing officer.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in these regulations a provision relieving a public agency of its obligation to provide tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement in a private school if the child did not first receive special education and related services from the LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
This authority is independent of the court's or hearing officer's authority under section 612 (a)(10)(C)(ii) of the Act to award reimbursement for private placements of children who previously were receiving special education and related services from a public agency. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The commenter further requested clarification regarding tribally controlled detention facilities that incarcerate a student from a different reservation than the reservation where the student attended a BIA-funded school.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As a general matter, for educational purposes, students who were enrolled in a BIA-funded school and are subsequently convicted as an adult and incarcerated in a State run adult prison are the responsibility of the State where the adult prison is located.  Section 612(a)(11)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.149(d) allow flexibility to States in that the Governor, or another individual pursuant to State law, can designate a public agency in the State, other than the SEA, as responsible for ensuring that FAPE is made available to eligible students with disabilities who are convicted under State law and incarcerated in the State's adult prisons.  This provision does not apply to the Secretary of the Interior.  Therefore, the Office of Indian Education Programs cannot delegate the responsibility of ensuring that the requirements of Part B of the Act are met by the State prison.  The Act does not specifically address who is responsible for education of students with disabilities in tribally controlled detention facilities.

State Complaint Procedures (Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1146%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  We received several comments questioning the statutory basis for the State complaint provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.  One commenter stated that the Act includes only two statutory references to State complaints and both references (sections 612(a)(14)(E) and 615(f)(3)(F) of the Act) immediately follow statutory prohibitions on due process remedies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that Congress did not require SEAs to create a complaint system and that section 1232c(a) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232c(a) (GEPA), provides only that the Department may require a State to investigate and resolve all complaints received by the State related to the administration of an applicable program.  The commenter stated that the permissive wording of this provision suggests that the Secretary or the Department can choose not to require a complaint investigation and resolution mechanism, particularly when such mechanism is unnecessary or, as in the case of the Act, effectively preempted by more specific requirements in the Act governing the applicable program.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter concluded that there is no basis for the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 because the Act only allows complaints to be filed with the State in two situations:  (1) by private school officials, regarding consultation and child find for parentally-placed private school children pursuant to section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) and (10)(A)(iii) of the Act, and (2) by parents, regarding personnel qualifications in section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act.  The commenter stated that in both cases, the Act does not detail a complaint process.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Although Congress did not specifically detail a State complaint process in the Act, we believe that the State complaint process is fully supported by the Act and necessary for the proper implementation of the Act and these regulations.  We believe a strong State complaint system provides parents and other individuals an opportunity to resolve disputes early without having to file a due process complaint and without having to go to a due process hearing.  The State complaint procedures are referenced in the following three separate sections of the Act:  (1) Section 611(e)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, which requires that States spend a portion of the amount of Part B funds that they can use for State-level activities on complaint investigations; (2) Section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act, which provides that nothing in that paragraph creates a private right of action for the failure of an SEA or LEA staff person to be highly qualified or prevents a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, as provided for under this part; and (3) Section 615(f)(3)(F) of the Act, which states that "[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the right of a parent to file a complaint with the State educational agency."  Paragraph (f)(3) is titled "Limitations on Hearing" and addresses issues such as the statute of limitations and that hearing issues are limited to the issues that the parent has raised in their due process notice.  The Senate Report explains that this provision clarifies that "nothing in section 615 shall be construed to affect a parent's right to file a complaint with the State educational agency, including complaints of procedural violations" (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 41).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Furthermore, the State complaint procedures were a part of the initial Part B regulations in 1977 (45 CFR 121a.602).  These regulations were moved into part 76 of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in the early 1980s, and were returned to the Part B regulations in 1992 (after the Department decided to move the regulations out of EDGAR and place them in program regulations for the major formula grant programs).  Although the State complaint procedures have changed in some respects in the years since 1977, the basic right of any individual or organization to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of program requirements has remained the same.  For these reasons, we believe the State complaint procedures should be retained in the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that use of the term "complaint" in reference to due process complaints and State complaint procedures is confusing.  One commenter requested that we use the phrase "due process hearing request" instead of "due process complaint" in the regulations to avoid confusion between the two processes.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615 of the Act uses the term "complaint" to refer to due process complaints.  We have used the phrase "due process complaint" instead of the statutory term "complaint" throughout these regulations to provide clarity and reduce confusion between due process complaints in section 615 of the Act and complaints under the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.  We believe this distinction is sufficient to reduce confusion and it is not necessary to add further clarification regarding the use of the term "complaint" in these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The regulations for State complaints under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 provide for the resolution of any complaint, including a complaint filed by an organization or an individual from another State alleging that the public agency violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or of part 300.  The public agency must resolve a State complaint within 60 days, unless there is a time extension as provided in Sec. 300.152(b).  Due process complaints, as noted in Sec. 300.507, however, may be filed by a parent or a public agency, consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.508 and Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.515.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that only issues related to violations of the law should be subject to the State complaint process.  One commenter stated that the State complaint procedures should be used only for systemic violations that reach beyond the involvement of one child in a school.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that the State complaint procedures can be used for the denial of appropriate services and the failure to provide FAPE in accordance with a child's IEP.  However, some commenters requested that the regulations clarify that disputes involving appropriateness of services and whether FAPE was provided should be dealt with in a due process hearing.  One commenter stated that the State complaint procedures should be used to investigate whether required procedures were followed and not to determine if evaluation data and student-specific data support the IEP Team's determination of what is appropriate for the child.  The commenter went on to state that the procedures for administrative hearings permit the examination and cross-examination of expert witnesses and establishing the credibility of the testimonies, which are the functions of a hearing officer, not SEA complaint specialists.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Some commenters, as noted above, seek to limit the scope of the State complaint system.  We believe the broad scope of the State complaint procedures, as permitted in the regulations, is critical to each State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities.  The complaint procedures provide parents, organizations, and other individuals with an important means of ensuring that the educational needs of children with disabilities are met and provide the SEA with a powerful tool to identify and correct noncompliance with Part B of the Act or of part 300.  We believe placing limits on the scope of the State complaint system, as suggested by the commenters, would diminish the SEA's ability to ensure its LEAs are in compliance with Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations, and may result in an increase in the number of due process complaints filed and the number of due process hearings held.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to clarify in the regulations that the State complaint procedures can be used to resolve a complaint regarding the denial of appropriate services or FAPE for a child, since Sec. 300.153 is sufficiently clear that an organization or individual may file a written complaint that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300.  The State complaint procedures can be used to resolve any complaint that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.153, including matters concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that an SEA, in resolving a complaint challenging the appropriateness of a child's educational program or services or the provision of FAPE, should not only determine whether the public agency has followed the required procedures to reach that determination, but also whether the public agency has reached a decision that is consistent with the requirements in Part B of the Act in light of the individual child's abilities and needs.  Thus, the SEA may need to review the evaluation data in the child's record, or any additional data provided by the parties to the complaint, and the explanation included in the public agency's notice to the parent as to why the agency made the determination regarding the child's educational program or services.  If necessary, the SEA may need to interview appropriate individuals, to determine whether the agency followed procedures and applied standards that are consistent with State standards, including the requirements of Part B of the Act, and whether the determination made by the public agency is consistent with those standards and supported by the data.  The SEA may, in its effort to resolve a complaint, determine that interviews with appropriate individuals are necessary for the SEA to obtain the relevant information needed to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or of part 300.  However, such interviews conducted by the SEA, as part of its effort to resolve a State complaint, are not intended to be comparable to the requirement in section 615(h)(2) of the Act, which provides any party to a due process hearing the right to present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, a parent always has the right to file a due process complaint and request a due process hearing on any matter concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of his or her child, or the provision of FAPE and may seek to resolve their disputes through mediation.  It is important to clarify that when the parent files both a due process complaint and a State complaint on the same issue, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.  However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152, including using the time limit and procedures in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 300.152.  (See Sec. 300.152(c)(1)).  Under the Act, the decision reached through the due process proceedings is the final decision on those matters, unless a party to the hearing appeals that decision by requesting State-level review, if applicable, or by bringing a civil action in an appropriate State or Federal court.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested amending Sec. 300.151(a)(2) to specifically include school personnel and teacher organizations in the list of entities to whom the SEA must disseminate the State complaint procedures.

Discussion:  Section 300.151(a)(2) already requires the State to widely disseminate the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 to parents and other interested parties, including parent training and information centers, protection and advocacy organizations, independent living centers, and other appropriate entities.  There is nothing in these regulations that would prevent a State from disseminating information about the State complaint procedures to school personnel, teacher organizations, or representatives of private schools or residential facilities.  However, we believe this decision is best left to the States.  We do not believe that there is a need to add these entities to the mandatory distribution as individuals involved in the education of children with disabilities are generally acquainted with these procedures. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested retaining current Sec. 300.660(b)(1), regarding the awarding of monetary reimbursement as a remedy for denial of appropriate services.  One commenter stated that the regulations should clarify that States continue to have authority to award monetary reimbursement, when appropriate.  A few commenters stated that the regulations should clarify that monetary reimbursement is not appropriate for a majority of State complaints.  Some commenters stated that removing current Sec. 300.660(b)(1) creates ambiguity and may result in increased litigation because parents may choose to use the more costly and time-consuming due process system if they believe that monetary relief is not available to them under the State complaint system.  Some commenters stated that removing current Sec. 300.660(b)(1) implies that monetary reimbursement is never appropriate.  A few commenters stated that removing the monetary reimbursement provision in current Sec. 300.660(b)(1) suggests that the Department no longer supports the use of this remedy.  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that compensatory services are an appropriate remedy when the LEA has failed to provide appropriate services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The SEA is responsible for ensuring that all public agencies within its jurisdiction meet the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.  In light of the SEA's general supervisory authority and responsibility under sections 612(a)(11) and 616 of the Act, we believe the SEA should have broad flexibility to determine the appropriate remedy or corrective action necessary to resolve a complaint in which the SEA has found that the public agency has failed to provide appropriate services to children with disabilities, including awarding monetary reimbursement and compensatory services.  To make this clear, we will change Sec. 300.151 to include monetary reimbursement and compensatory services as examples of corrective actions that may be appropriate to address the needs of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The awarding of attorneys' fees is not addressed in Sec. 300.151(b) because the State complaint process is not an administrative proceeding or judicial action, and, therefore, the awarding of attorneys' fees is not available under the Act for State complaint resolutions.  Section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act clarifies that a court may award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in any action or proceeding brought under section 615 of the Act.  We, therefore, may not include in the regulations the language from section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act, as suggested by the commenters, because State complaint procedures are not an action or proceeding brought under section 615 of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested changing Sec. 300.152(a)(1), to include situations when the SEA is the subject of a complaint.  Another commenter recommended that the State complaint procedures include how the SEA should handle a complaint against the SEA for its failure to supervise the LEA or failure to provide direct services when given notice that the LEA has failed to so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to specify in the regulations how the SEA should handle a complaint filed against the SEA because Sec. 300.151 clarifies that, if an organization or individual files a complaint, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, the SEA must resolve the complaint.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.33 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, the term public agency includes the SEA.  The SEA must, therefore, resolve any complaint against the SEA pursuant to the SEA's adopted State complaint procedures.  The SEA, however, may either appoint its own personnel to resolve the complaint, or may make arrangements with an outside party to resolve the complaint.  If it chooses to use an outside party, however, the SEA remains responsible for complying with all procedural and remediation steps required in part 300.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe the regulations should require the SEA to conduct an on-site investigation in the manner suggested by the commenter because we believe Sec. 300.152(a)(1) is sufficient to ensure that an independent on-site investigation is carried out if the SEA determines that such an investigation is necessary to resolve a complaint.  The minimum State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152 are intended to be broad in recognition of the fact that States operate differently and standards appropriate to one State may not be appropriate in another State.  Therefore, the standards to be used in conducting an on-site investigation are best determined by the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.152 would allow an unlimited period of time to resolve complaints and requested that the regulations limit the complaint resolution process to 30 days, similar to the procedures when a due process hearing is requested.  A few commenters requested that the 60-day time limit be lengthened to 90 days, given that many complaints involve complex issues and multiple interviews with school administrators.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.  We believe altering this timeframe would be unnecessarily disruptive to States' developed complaint procedures.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is appropriate to change the time limit as recommended by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the regulations are silent as to how an amended State complaint should be handled.  One commenter expressed concern about resolving complaints within the 60-day time limit when the complainant submits additional information about the complaint and amends the complaint.  The commenter requested that in such cases, the regulations should allow the 60-day time limit to begin from the date the State receives the amended complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152 provides that the complaint must be resolved 60 days after a complaint is filed and that the complainant must be given an opportunity to submit additional information, either orally or in writing, about the allegations in the complaint.  Generally, if the additional information a parent submits is on the same or related incident, it would be part of the amended complaint.  If the information submitted by the complainant is on a different or unrelated incident, generally, the new information would be treated as a separate complaint.  On the other hand, if the information submitted by the complainant were on the same incident, generally, the new information would be treated as an amendment to the original complaint.  It is, ultimately, left to each State to determine whether the new information constitutes a new complaint or whether it is related to a pending complaint.  We believe the decision regarding whether the additional information is a new complaint or an amendment to an existing complaint, is best left to the State.  The State must have the flexibility to make this determination based on the circumstances of a particular complaint and consistent with its State complaint process and, therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to regulate further on this matter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
There are no provisions in Part B of the Act or in these regulations that permit the 60-day time limit to begin from the date the State receives an amended complaint, if additional information submitted by the complainant results in an amendment to the complaint.  However, Sec. 300.152(b) permits an extension of the 60-day time limit if exceptional circumstances exist or the parent and the public agency agree to extend the time limit to attempt to resolve the complaint through mediation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.152 provides that the SEA must review all relevant information and, if it determines it to be necessary, carry out an independent on-site investigation in order to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300.  We believe the SEA is in the best position, and should have the flexibility, to determine what information is necessary to resolve a complaint, based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.  It is true that, in some cases, a review of documents provided by the parties may be sufficient for the SEA to resolve a complaint and that conducting an on-site investigation or interviews with staff, for example, may be unnecessary.  The SEA, based on the facts in the case, must decide whether an on-site investigation is necessary.

Comment:  A few commenters requested adding language to proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3) to allow an SEA to provide opportunities for resolving the complaint through mediation and other informal mechanisms for dispute resolution with any party filing a complaint, not only the parents.  Some commenters requested that the regulations clarify that mediation is the appropriate method to resolve State complaints regarding the denial of appropriate services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters expressed concern that the phrase "[w]ith the consent of the parent" in proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3) implies that complaints are disagreements between parents and public agencies, rather than allegations of violations of a child's or a parent's rights under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters supported the use of mediation to resolve a complaint, but requested that alternative means of dispute resolution be deleted.  Other commenters expressed concern that providing yet another means of initiating mediation or other dispute resolution is unnecessary because these options are already available to parties who wish to use them.  A few commenters requested that the regulations define alternative means of dispute resolution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.152(a)(3) was proposed to encourage meaningful, informal, resolution of disputes between the public agency and parents, organizations, or other individuals by providing an opportunity for parties to resolve disputes at the local level without the need for the SEA to resolve the matter.  We believe that, at a minimum, the State's complaint procedures should allow the public agency that is the subject of the complaint the opportunity to respond to a complaint by proposing a resolution and provide an opportunity for a parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to resolve a dispute by voluntarily engaging in mediation.  However, we do not believe that the SEA should be required to offer other alternative means of dispute resolution, and so will remove the reference to these other alternatives from the minimum procedures in Sec. 300.152(a)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe it is important to retain the provision in Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)), with modification, to reinforce the use of voluntary mediation as a viable option for resolving disputes between the public agency and the parents at the local level prior to the SEA investigating, if necessary, and resolving a dispute.  Resolving disputes between parties at the local level through the use of mediation, or other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State, will be less adversarial and less time consuming and expensive than a State complaint investigation, if necessary, or a due process hearing and, ultimately, children with disabilities will be the beneficiaries of a local level resolution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Requiring that the public agency provide an opportunity for the parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to voluntarily engage in mediation in an effort to resolve a dispute is an appropriate minimum requirement and consistent with the statutory provision in section 615(e) of the Act that voluntary mediation be made available to parties (i.e., parent and public agency) to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint.  However, the statute does not require that mediation be available to other parties, and we believe it would be burdensome to expand, through regulation, new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) to require that States offer mediation to non-parents.  Although we do not believe we should regulate to require that mediation be offered to non-parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude an SEA from permitting the use of mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, if available in the State, to resolve a State complaint filed by an organization or individual other than a parent, and we will add language to Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to permit extensions of the timeline if the parties are voluntarily engaged in any of these dispute resolution procedures.  In fact, we encourage SEAs and their public agencies to consider alternative means of resolving disputes between the public agency and organizations or other individuals, at the local level, consistent with State law and administrative procedures.  It is up to each State, however, to determine whether non-parents can use mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 615(e) of the Act makes clear that mediation is a voluntary mechanism for resolving disputes and may not be used to delay or deny a parent's right to a due process hearing on the parent's due process complaint, or to deny any other rights afforded under Part B of the Act.  In light of the fact that mediation is a voluntary process, the parties only need to agree to engage in mediation and it is not necessary to obtain parental written consent to engage in this voluntary process.  We will, therefore, change new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) by removing the phrase "[w]ith the consent of the parent" and adding a reference to Sec. 300.506.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to include in the regulations a definition of the term "alternative means of dispute resolution" because the term is generally understood to refer to other procedures and processes that States have found to be effective in resolving disputes quickly and effectively but does not include those dispute resolution processes required under the Act or these final regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) by removing "with the consent of the parent" and "or other alternative means of dispute resolution" and adding a reference to Sec. 300.506.  We have also amended Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii), as stated above, to clarify that a public agency's State complaint procedures must permit an extension of the 60-day time limit if a parent (or individual or organization, if mediation, or other alternative means of dispute resolution is available to the individual or organization under State procedures) who has filed a complaint and the public agency voluntarily agree to extend the time to engage in mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the agreement to extend the 60-day time limit (to allow the parties to engage in mediation, or alternative means of dispute resolution, or both) should meet the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9.  One commenter requested an extension of the 60-day time limit to resolve complaints when mediation is underway.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9, should be required to extend the 60-day time limit because it would add burden and is not necessary.  It is sufficient to require agreement of the parties.  At any time that either party withdraws from mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution, or withdraws agreement to the extension of the time limit, the extension would end.  We believe Sec. 300.152(b) is sufficiently clear that an extension of the 60-day time limit is permissible if exceptional circumstances exist with respect to a particular complaint, or if the parent and the public agency agree to extend the time to engage in mediation.  We also believe it would be permissible to extend the 60-day time limit if the public agency and an organization or other individual agree to engage in an alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State, and the parties agree to extend the 60-day time limit.

Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations include a provision to allow parents to use the State complaint process to enforce agreements reached in mediation and resolution sessions.

Discussion:  The Act provides that the enforcement and implementation of agreements reached through mediation and resolution sessions may be obtained through State and Federal courts.  Section 300.506(b)(7), consistent with section 615(e)(2)(F)(iii) of the Act, states that a written, signed mediation agreement is enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.  Similarly, Sec. 300.510(c)(2), consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(iii)(II) of the Act, states that a written settlement agreement resulting from a resolution meeting is enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, as noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes for subpart E, we have added new Sec. 300.537 that allows, but does not require, a State to have mechanisms or procedures that permit parties to mediation or resolution agreements to seek enforcement of those agreements and decisions at the SEA level.  We believe this provision is sufficient to allow States the flexibility to determine what mechanisms or procedures, if any, may be appropriate to enforce such agreements, including utilizing their State complaint procedures, if they choose to do so, so long as the mechanisms or procedures are not used to deny or delay a parent's right to seek enforcement through State and Federal courts. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters requested that current Sec. 300.661(c)(3), regarding the SEA's responsibility to resolve complaints alleging a public agency's failure to implement due process decisions, be retained.

One commenter stated that parents would be forced to litigate due process decisions, which will prolong the denial of FAPE to children.

A few commenters expressed concern that if issues in a State complaint, which are not part of a due process complaint, are not investigated until the due process complaint is resolved, children may go without FAPE for extended periods of time.  These commenters also stated that parents are likely to file for due process on every issue of concern, rather than using the more expeditious and less expensive State complaint procedures.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that language in current Sec. 300.661(c), requiring that States set aside any part of a State complaint that is being addressed in a due process hearing, until the conclusion of the hearing and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing, should be retained. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised Sec. 300.152(c)(1) by adding the requirements in current Sec. 300.661(c)(1) to the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the regulations do not address the disposition of a complaint if a parent and a public agency come to a resolution of a complaint through mediation.  One commenter recommended that the regulations provide guidance on how an SEA should handle a complaint that is withdrawn.  Another commenter requested clarification on what should occur if an SEA does not approve of the agreement reached between the parent and the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate on these matters, as recommended by the commenters.  Section 615(e)(2)(F) of the Act and Sec. 300.506(b)(7) clarify that an agreement reached through mediation is a legally binding document enforceable in State and Federal courts.  Therefore, an agreement reached through mediation is not subject to the SEA's approval.  We strongly encourage parties to resolve a complaint at the local level without the need for the SEA to intervene.  If a complaint is resolved at the local level or is withdrawn, no further action is required by the SEA to resolve the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested including language in the regulations that would require parties to provide evidence under threat of perjury.  Another commenter stated that the State complaint process should be non-adversarial and that neither party should have the right to review the other's submissions or to cross-examine the other party.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to include the language suggested by the commenters because we believe requiring parties to provide evidence under the threat of perjury, permitting parties to review submissions, and allowing one party to cross-examine the other party are contrary to the intent of the State complaint process.  The State complaint process is intended to be less adversarial than the more formal filing of a due process complaint and possibly going to a due process hearing.  To make the changes requested by the commenters will serve only to make the State complaint process more adversarial and will not be in the best interest of the child.  The State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 do not require parties to provide evidence, nor do they require that a State allow parties to review the submissions of the other party or to cross-examine witnesses.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended the regulations include a limit on the number of times that an individual may file a State complaint against a public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An SEA is required to resolve any complaint that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.153, including complaints that raise systemic issues, and individual child complaints.  It would be inconsistent with the Act's provisions in section 616 regarding enforcement and the Act's provisions in section 612 regarding general supervision for an SEA to have a State complaint procedure that removes or limits a party's right to file a complaint that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, including limiting the number of times a party can file a complaint with the SEA.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to include in the regulations the language suggested by the commenter, nor should the SEA include in its State complaint procedures any restriction on the number of times a party can file a complaint, as long as the complaint meets the requirements of Sec. 300.153. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested retaining current Sec. 300.662(c), which permits a complaint to be filed about a violation that occurred more than one year prior to the date the complaint is received if the violation is continuing or the complainant is requesting compensatory services for a violation that occurred more than three years prior to the date the complaint is received.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Some commenters requested that the regulations permit a parent to have as much time to file a State complaint as a parent would have to file a due process complaint (two years, unless provided otherwise by State law).  One commenter stated that extensions of the statute of limitations should be granted when circumstances warrant an extension.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter suggested adding language providing that the timeline begins when a parent first learns about the violation.  A few commenters stated that parents need a longer statute of limitations for State complaints because they do not always know about violations when they occur and may not fully understand how the violation affects their child's education.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that Congress did not intend to create a one-year statute of limitations for State complaints when it created a two-year statute of limitations for due process hearings.  Several commenters stated that there is no evidence that Congress intended to change the current three-year statute of limitations on the parents' right to file a State complaint when the violation is ongoing or compensatory services are being requested.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe a one-year timeline is reasonable, and will assist in smooth implementation of the State complaint procedures.  The references to longer periods for continuing violations and for compensatory services claims in current Sec. 300.662(c) were removed to ensure expedited resolution for public agencies and children with disabilities.  Limiting a complaint to a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date that the complaint is received will help ensure that problems are raised and addressed promptly so that children receive FAPE.  We believe longer time limits are not generally effective and beneficial to the child because the issues in a State complaint become so stale that they are unlikely to be resolved.  However, States may choose to accept and resolve complaints regarding alleged violations that occurred outside the one-year timeline, just as they are free to add additional protections in other areas that are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is necessary to retain the language in current Sec. 300.662(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is appropriate to change the timeline to begin when a parent first learns about the violation, as suggested by the commenter, because such a provision could lead to some complaints being filed well beyond one year from the time the violation actually occurred.  This also would make the issue of the complaint so stale that the SEA would not be able to reasonably resolve the complaint and recommend an appropriate corrective action.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As we stated earlier in the Analysis of Comments and Changes for this subpart, Congress did not specifically address or detail a State complaint process in the Act; nor did Congress express an opinion regarding the time limit for filing a complaint under a State's complaint process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.153(c) appears to indicate that if a State complaint is also the subject of a due process complaint the time period to file the complaint is two years, rather than the one-year time limit applicable for all other State complaints.  Several commenters stated that this provision should be removed and that a one-year limitation should apply to all State complaints, regardless of whether a request for a due process hearing is filed on the issue(s) in the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a State complaint contains multiple issues of which one or more is part of a due process hearing, the one-year statute of limitations would apply to the issues that are resolved under the State complaint procedures; the State due process statute of limitations would apply to the issues that are the subject of the due process hearing.  We agree that the language in Sec. 300.153 is confusing and will amend the language to remove the reference to the due process complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.153(d) that requires the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child at the same time the party files the complaint with the SEA.  One commenter stated that filing a complaint is onerous enough for parents, without including an extra step of requiring a copy of the complaint to be forwarded to the school.  One commenter stated that this poses an unnecessary paperwork burden on parents.  A few commenters stated that forwarding a copy of the complaint to the LEA should be the responsibility of the SEA, not the parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter expressed concern that requiring the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child will discourage parents or school personnel whistle blowers from filing a complaint and recommended instead, that the regulations require SEAs to provide the LEA with a concise statement of fact upon which the complaint is based and the provisions of laws and rules that are at issue.  A few commenters requested including language in Sec. 300.153(d) giving the SEA discretion to protect the confidentiality of the complainant.  A few commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.153(b)(3) for the written complaint to include the signature and contact information for the complainant.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The purpose of requiring the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child, at the same time the party files the complaint with the SEA, is to ensure that the public agency involved has knowledge of the issues and an opportunity to resolve them directly with the complaining party at the earliest possible time.  The sooner the LEA knows that a complaint is filed and the nature of the issue(s), the quicker the LEA can work directly with the complainant to resolve the complaint.  We believe the benefit of having the complainant forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency far outweigh the minimal burden placed on the complainant because it will lead to a faster resolution of the complaint at the local level.  For these reasons, we also do not believe it is more efficient to have the SEA forward the complaint to the public agency or provide the public agency with a statement summarizing the complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe that the complaint procedures should provide for the confidentiality of the complainant.  The complainant should not remain unknown to the public agency that is the subject of the complaint because that public agency needs to know who the complainant is and something about the complaint (consistent with Sec. 300.153) before it can be expected to resolve the issues.  We believe it is reasonable to require a party to file a signed complaint and provide contact information to the SEA in order to ensure the credibility of the complaint and provide the SEA with the basic contact information necessary for the SEA to handle complaints expeditiously.  If the SEA receives a complaint that is not signed, as required in Sec. 300.153, the SEA may choose to dismiss the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that a parent must have legal knowledge in order to correctly file a State complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Contrary to the commenter's assertion that a parent must have legal knowledge to file a complaint, we believe the State complaint procedures, which are under the direct control of the SEA, provide the parent and the school district with mechanisms that allow them to resolve differences without having to resort to a more costly and cumbersome due process complaint, which, by its nature, is litigious.  We believe if a State effectively implements its State complaint procedures, both parents and public agencies will generally find the process efficient and easy to initiate.  We further believe that the requirement in Sec. 300.509 that each SEA must develop model forms to assist parents in filing a State complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, and in filing a due process complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.507(a) and 300.508(a) through (c), will make the process of filing such complaints much easier for parents and others.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the complainant should not have to propose a resolution to the problem, as required in Sec. 300.153(b)(4)(v), in order to have the State investigate a complaint. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.153(b)(4)(v) requires the complainant to propose a resolution to the complaint only to the extent known and available to the complainant at the time the complaint is filed.  We believe this proposed resolution is necessary because it gives the complainant an opportunity to state what he or she believes to be the problem and how the complainant believes it can be resolved.  This is important because it gives the complainant an opportunity to tell the public agency what is wrong and what it would take to fix the problem from the complainant's point of view.  It also will give the LEA an opportunity to choose either to do as the complainant requests or propose a solution that it believes would resolve the issue raised by the complainant.  Thus, if successful, the parties will avoid an adversarial relationship and possibly the expense of a due process hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.153(d) include language allowing an LEA to appeal an SEA finding to an administrative hearing or the courts.  Another commenter expressed concern that the State complaint procedures lack an appeals process for parties that lose under the State complaint procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The regulations neither prohibit nor require the establishment of procedures to permit an LEA or other party to request reconsideration of a State complaint decision.  We have chosen to be silent in the regulations about whether a State complaint decision may be appealed because we believe States are in the best position to determine what, if any, appeals process is necessary to meet each State's needs, consistent with State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a State chooses, however, to adopt a process for appealing a State complaint decision, such process may not waive any of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153. Section 300.152 requires that the SEA issue a final decision on each complaint within 60 calendar days after the complaint is filed, unless the SEA extends the timeline as provided in Sec. 300.152(b).  This means that, absent an appropriate extension of the timeline for a particular complaint, the State must issue a final decision within 60 calendar days.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, if after the SEA's final decision is issued, a party who has the right to request a due process hearing (that is, the parent or LEA) and who disagrees with the SEA's decision may initiate a due process hearing, provided that the subject of the State complaint involves an issue about which a due process hearing can be filed and the two-year statute of limitations for due process hearings (or other time limit imposed by State law) has not expired.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit an SEA from posting interagency agreements on Web sites, in public buildings, or making them available upon request.  However, we believe that it would be unnecessarily burdensome to require SEAs to do so and any decision regarding posting interagency agreements is best left to the States' discretion.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that interagency agreements are important because agencies other than SEAs (e.g., mental health agencies that place children in residential facilities) are responsible for providing special educational services.  The commenter requested that the regulations specify that residential facilities be allowed reimbursement for providing educational services and that children in these facilities are entitled to FAPE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to further clarify in the regulations that children with disabilities who are placed in residential facilities by public agencies are entitled to FAPE because Sec. 300.146, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, provides that SEAs must ensure that children with disabilities receive FAPE when they are placed in or referred to private schools or facilities by public agencies.  Whether residential facilities can receive reimbursement for educational services will depend on how States have apportioned financial responsibility among State agencies and we do not believe that regulating on this issue is appropriate or necessary. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to further clarify that the LEA is ultimately responsible for providing services because Sec. 300.154(b)(2) sufficiently requires that if a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for the special education and related services in Sec. 300.154(b)(1), the LEA or State agency responsible for developing the child's IEP must provide or pay for these services to the child in a timely manner.  Disagreements about the interagency agreements should not stop or delay the receipt of the services described in the child's IEP.  Section 300.103(c) also addresses timely services and clarifies that, consistent with Sec. 300.323(c), the State must ensure there is no delay in implementing a child's IEP, including any situation in which the source for providing or paying for the special education or related services to a child is being determined.  Section 612(a)(12)(A)(i) of the Act provides that the financial responsibility of public agencies (other than an educational agency), including Medicaid and other public insurers obligated under Federal or State law or assigned responsibility under State policy, must precede financial responsibility of the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern regarding the use of a parent's public benefits or insurance to pay for services required under Part B of the Act because co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses would be a hardship to low-income families.

Discussion:  The commenters' concerns are addressed in Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii).  Section 300.154(d)(2)(ii) states that a public agency may not require parents to incur an out-of-pocket expense, such as the payment of a deductible or co-pay amount, in filing a claim for services, and may pay from funds reserved under the Act, the cost that the parent would otherwise be required to pay.  In addition, Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iii) states that a public agency may not use a child's benefits under a public benefits or insurance program if that use would decrease lifetime coverage or any other insured benefit; result in the family paying for services that would otherwise be covered by the public benefits or insurance program and that are required for the child outside of the time the child is in school; increase premiums or lead to the discontinuation of benefits or insurance; or risk loss of eligibility for home and community-based waivers, based on aggregate health-related expenditures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested changing "parental consent" to "informed parental consent."  One commenter recommended requiring public agencies to obtain parental consent each time the public agency seeks to access the parent's public benefits or insurance.  Some commenters recommended removing the requirement to obtain parental consent to use Medicaid benefits to pay for services required under Part B of the Act.  A few commenters opposed requiring parental consent stating the process is an administrative burden.  Other commenters recommended waiving the requirement for consent if the agency has taken reasonable measures to obtain such consent or the parent's consent was given to the State Medicaid Agency. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In order for a public agency to use the Medicaid or other public benefits or insurance program in which a child participates to provide or pay for services required under the Act, the public agency must provide the benefits or insurance program with information from the child's education records (e.g., services provided, length of the services).  Information from a child's education records is protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232(g) (FERPA), and section 617(c) of the Act.  Under FERPA and section 617(c) of the Act, a child's education records cannot be released to a State Medicaid agency without parental consent, except for a few specified exceptions that do not include the release of education records for insurance billing purposes.  Parental consent requires, among other things, that the parent be fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, consistent with Sec. 300.9.  Thus, there is no need to change "parental consent" to "informed consent," as recommended by one commenter.  However, we believe it would avoid confusion for the references to "consent" in paragraphs (d) and (e) in Sec. 300.154 to be consistent.  Therefore, we will add a reference to Sec. 300.9 in Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv)(A) and delete "informed" from Sec. 300.154(e)(1).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe obtaining parental consent each time the public agency seeks to use a parent's public insurance or other public benefits to provide or pay for a service is important to protect the privacy rights of the parent and to ensure that the parent is fully informed of a public agency's access to his or her public benefits or insurance and the services paid by the public benefits or insurance program.  Therefore, we will revise Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv) to clarify that parental consent is required each time the public agency seeks to use the parent's public insurance or other public benefits.  We do not believe that it would be appropriate to include a provision permitting waiver of parental consent in this circumstance, even where a public agency makes reasonable efforts to obtain the required parental consent.  However, we agree with the commenter that a public agency could satisfy parental consent requirements under FERPA and section 617(c) of the Act if the parent provided the required parental consent to the State Medicaid agency, and the consent satisfied the Part B definition of consent in Sec. 300.9. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also believe that it is important to let parents know that their refusal to allow access to their public benefits or insurance does not relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at no cost to the parents.  We will, therefore, add a new paragraph (B) to Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv) to make this clear.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Finally, because we have referenced the definition of consent in Sec. 300.9 throughout the rest of these regulations, rather than the consent provisions in Sec. 300.622, we have removed the reference to Sec. 300.622.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.154(d)(2)(iv) has been changed to clarify that consent must be obtained each time the public agency seeks to access a parent's public benefits or insurance and to clarify that a parent's refusal to allow access to the parent's public benefits or insurance does not relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at no cost to the parent.  The reference to Sec. 300.622 has been removed and we have added "consistent with Sec. 300.9" following "parental consent" in Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv)(A).  For consistency, we have removed "informed" before "consent" in Sec. 300.154(e)(1). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that LEAs and agencies that, by law, must provide educational services should not be allowed to use public benefits or insurance to pay for these programs. One commenter suggested that the Act be more closely aligned with the Medicaid laws.  One commenter requested requiring public benefits or insurance agencies, when paying for special education, to meet the standards of the Act, and not the standards for medical environments.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the comment that LEAs and other public agencies responsible for providing special education and related services to children with disabilities should not be allowed to use public benefits or insurance to pay for these services.  Pursuant to section 612(a)(12) of the Act, if a child is covered by a public benefits or insurance program and there is no cost to the family or the child in using the benefits of that program to support a service included in a child's IEP, the public agency is encouraged to use the public benefits or insurance to the extent possible.  We believe public benefits or insurance are important resources for LEAs and other public agencies to access, when appropriate, to assist in meeting their obligation to make FAPE available to all children who are eligible to receive services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.103 retains the Department's longstanding provision that clarifies that each State may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private sources of support are available in the State to meet the requirements of part 300.  Nothing in part 300 relieves an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Act does not give the Department the authority to impose the standards of the Act on public benefits or insurance agencies, when paying for special education.  If, however, a third party provider, such as a public benefits or insurance company, is unable to provide funding for services outside a clinical setting or other specific setting, the public agency cannot use the third party provider's inability to provide such funding as an appropriate justification for not providing a child with a disability FAPE in the LRE.  Nothing in part 300 alters the requirements imposed on a State Medicaid agency, or any other agency administering a public benefits or insurance program by Federal statute, regulation, or policy under Title XIX or Title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396 through 1396(v) and 42 U.S.C. 1397aa through 1397jj, or any other public benefits or insurance program.

Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is necessary because Sec. 300.154(d)(2) is sufficiently clear that the child's receipt of Medicaid-funded educational services, consistent with the Act and these regulations, should not deny the child receipt of other services for which he or she may be eligible under Medicaid or other noneducational programs.  Further, Sec. 300.103(b) provides that nothing in part 300 relieves an insurer or third party from an otherwise valid obligation to pay for services provided to a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters requested that the personnel qualification requirements in Sec. 300.156 apply to personnel who provide travel instruction and teachers of children with visual impairments.  Other commenters requested that personnel who provide therapeutic recreation services be required to meet the personnel qualifications.  Some commenters requested that the personnel qualifications apply to preschool special education teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to list the specific personnel who provide services to children with disabilities under the Act and to whom the requirements in Sec. 300.156 apply because the regulations are sufficiently clear that all needed personnel are covered.  This includes personnel who provide travel instruction or therapeutic recreation services; teachers of children with visual impairments, if such personnel are necessary to carry out the purposes of this part; and preschool teachers in States where preschool teachers are considered elementary school teachers.  Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(A) of the Act, requires each SEA to establish and maintain personnel qualification requirements to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act and part 300 are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the regulations should define what it means to be qualified to provide services to children with disabilities under the Act.  The commenter stated that the regulations do not include any requirements for general education teachers or administrators who are involved in providing instruction and services for children in special education.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to change the regulations to define what it means to be qualified to provide services because we believe that, aside from the "highly qualified" requirements for teachers and special education teachers in ESEA and the Act, other personnel qualifications are appropriately left to the States, in light of the variability in State circumstances.  Further, Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, makes it clear that it is the responsibility of the SEA, not the Federal government, to establish and maintain qualifications for personnel who provide services to children with disabilities under the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter objected to the removal of the requirements for a comprehensive system of personnel development in current Sec. 300.135.  The commenter also stated that regular education teachers need to be trained to work with children with disabilities to ensure that their inclusion in the regular classroom is successful.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Current Sec. 300.135 required States to have in effect a system of personnel development to ensure an adequate supply of qualified special education, regular education, and related services personnel.  Section 612(a)(14) of the Act removed this requirement.  The removal of current Sec. 300.135, however, does not diminish the responsibility of each State to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel (including regular education teachers) necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, consistent with Sec. 300.156.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations include language from note 97 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 192, which requires SEAs to establish rigorous qualifications for related services providers to ensure that children with disabilities receive the appropriate quality and quantity of care.  Several commenters requested that the regulations require SEAs to consult with LEAs, other State agencies, the disability community, and professional organizations regarding appropriate qualifications for related services providers and different service delivery models (e.g., consultative, supervisory, and collaborative models).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that States already have sufficient incentive to ensure that related services providers provide services of appropriate quality so that children with disabilities can achieve to high standards and that further regulation in this area is not necessary.  Section 300.156(b), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(B) of the Act, includes the qualifications for related services personnel.  There is nothing in the Act that requires SEAs to consult with LEAs, other State agencies, or other groups and organizations to determine the appropriate qualifications for related services providers and the use of different service delivery models, and while we agree that this is good practice and encourage SEAs to participate in such consultation, we do not believe that we should regulate in this manner.  States should have the flexibility, based on each State's unique circumstances, to determine how best to establish and maintain standards for all personnel who are providers of special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters objected to Sec. 300.156(b) and the removal of the requirement in current Sec. 300.136 for State professional requirements to be based on the highest requirements in the State.  The commenters stated that the removal of this requirement relaxes the qualification standards for speech-language pathologists and other related services personnel.  Several commenters stated that speech-language professionals should be required to have advanced degrees (i.e., master's level) because a bachelor's degree does not provide adequate preparation.  Many commenters expressed concern that the requirements in Sec. 300.156(b) will lead to a decline in the quality of related services provided to children with disabilities in public schools.  Other commenters expressed concern that increasing the standards will exacerbate the shortage of related services personnel experienced by large urban school districts.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not changing Sec. 300.156 because it reflects the specific language in section 612(a)(14) of the Act, which was intended to provide greater flexibility to SEAs to establish appropriate personnel standards, including the standards for speech-language pathologists.  As indicated in note 97 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 192, section 612(a)(14) of the Act removes the requirement for State professional requirements to be based on the highest requirements in the State because of concerns that the previous law, regarding the qualifications of related services providers, established an unreasonable standard for SEAs to meet, and as a result, led to a shortage of related services providers for children with disabilities.  We believe that States can exercise the flexibility provided in Sec. 300.156 and section 612(a)(14) of the Act while ensuring appropriate services for children with disabilities without additional regulation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that Sec. 300.156(b) establishes qualifications for related services providers in public schools that are less rigorous than the qualifications for related services providers who provide Medicaid services or services in other public settings, such as hospitals.  The commenters stated that less rigorous qualifications would result in a two-tiered system in which related services providers in public schools will be less qualified than related services providers in other public agencies.  Another commenter expressed concern that the relaxation of standards for speech-language pathologists would cause LEAs to lose Medicaid funds that are used to assist children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14)(B)(i) of the Act, clarifies that it is up to each SEA to establish qualifications for personnel to carry out the purposes of the Act.  This will require weighing the various policy concerns unique to each State.  The qualifications of related services providers required under Medicaid, or in hospitals and other public settings, and the fact that Medicaid will not pay for providers who do not meet Medicaid provider qualifications should serve as an incentive for States that want to bill for medical services on children's IEPs to impose consistent requirements for qualifications of related services providers. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters stated that related services personnel should be considered to have met the qualifications in Sec. 300.156(b)(1), regarding State-recognized certification, licensing, registration or other comparable requirements, if such personnel hold an academic degree consistent with their profession's national certification or State license to practice; demonstrate satisfactory progress toward full certification in the schools as prescribed by the State; and assume related services personnel functions for a specified period not to exceed three years.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters objected to the requirement that related services personnel must not have had certification or licensure requirements waived.  One commenter stated that emergency, temporary, or provisional certificates are necessary for professionals relocating from different States or different countries, and predicted that professionals with emergency, temporary, or provisional certification would work for contract agencies to bypass the requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. 300.156(b) that State qualifications for related services personnel must include qualifications that are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to the professional discipline in which those personnel are providing special education or related services, are sufficient to ensure related services personnel are qualified to provide appropriate services to children with disabilities while maintaining the States' flexibility to establish appropriate personnel standards for related services personnel.  We do not believe, therefore, that it is necessary to include additional regulation as suggested by commenters. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.156(b)(2)(ii) tracks the statutory requirement in section 612(a)(14)(B)(ii) of the Act, which requires that related services personnel not have certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis.  We do not believe this provision unnecessarily hinders States from hiring professionals from other States or countries.  States, in examining the credentials of prospective related services personnel from other States or countries, may find that their existing certification or licensure requirements are ones that these related services personnel could readily meet.  Because each State has full authority to define and enforce its own requirements that personnel must meet in order to receive full State certification or licensure, States that employ related services personnel from other States or countries may, consistent with State law and policy, consider establishing a separate category of certification that would differ from emergency, temporary, or provisional certification in that the State would not be waiving any training or experiential requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended using nationally recognized standards to determine the qualifications of related services personnel.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate as suggested by the commenters because these matters are better left to States to decide as States are in the best position to determine appropriate professional requirements for their States.  There is nothing in the Act that requires an SEA to determine qualifications of related services personnel based on nationally recognized standards or current professional standards.  Professional organizations may establish personnel standards for related services personnel that differ from the standards established by a State, but section 612(a)(14) of the Act clarifies that the State is responsible for establishing and maintaining personnel qualifications to ensure that related services personnel have the knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities under the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require high standards for paraprofessionals.  Several commenters requested guidance on the appropriate use of paraprofessionals to ensure that paraprofessionals and assistants are not used as a means of circumventing certification and licensing requirements for related services providers.  A few commenters requested language clarifying that the elimination of the requirement that State professional requirements be based on the highest requirements in the State in current Sec. 300.136(b) must not be used to justify the inappropriate use of paraprofessionals or related services providers.  Another commenter asked that the regulations require States to ensure that paraprofessionals are properly supervised at all times.  One commenter stated that the regulations should clarify the use of State standards for speech-language pathology paraprofessionals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, are sufficient to ensure that paraprofessionals meet high standards and that including additional requirements in these regulations is unnecessary.  These provisions require an SEA to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel, including paraprofessionals, are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities; and require the qualifications for paraprofessionals to be consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to the professional discipline in which those personnel are providing special education or related services.  In addition, the ESEA requires that paraprofessionals working in a program supported by title I of the ESEA, including special education paraprofessionals who assist in instruction in title I-funded programs, have at least an associate's degree, have completed at least two years of college, or meet a rigorous standard of quality and demonstrate, through a formal State or local assessment, knowledge of, and the ability to assist in instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics, reading readiness, writing readiness, or mathematics readiness, as appropriate.  Paraprofessionals in title I schools do not need to meet these requirements if their role does not involve instructional support, such as special education paraprofessionals who solely provide personal care services.  For more information on the ESEA requirements for paraprofessionals, see 34 CFR 200.58 and section 1119 of the ESEA, and the Department's nonregulatory guidance, Title I Paraprofessionals (March 1, 2004), which can be found on the Department's Web site at:  http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.pdf.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the commenter requesting that the regulations clarify the use of State standards for speech-language paraprofessionals, we do not believe it is appropriate to include clarification regarding a specific discipline in these regulations because the Act requires States to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that paraprofessionals, including speech-language paraprofessionals, are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.156(b)(2)(iii), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(B)(iii) of the Act, does specifically allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, regulation, or written policy, to assist in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities under the Act.  However, this provision should not be construed to permit or encourage the use of paraprofessionals as a replacement for teachers or related services providers who meet State qualification standards.  To the contrary, using paraprofessionals and assistants as teachers or related services providers would be inconsistent with the State's duty to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Paraprofessionals in public schools are not directly responsible for the provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities; rather, these aides provide special education and related services to children with disabilities only under the supervision of special education and related services personnel.  We believe the provision in Sec. 300.156(b)(2)(iii) sufficiently ensures that paraprofessionals and assistants are adequately supervised and further clarification in these regulations is unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Act makes clear that the use of paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained and supervised must be contingent on State law, regulation, and written policy giving States the option of determining whether paraprofessionals and assistants can be used to assist in the provision of special education and related services under Part B of the Act, and, if so, to what extent their use would be permissible.  However, it is critical that States that use paraprofessionals and assistants to assist in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities do so in a manner that is consistent with the rights of children with disabilities to FAPE under Part B of the Act.  There is no need to provide additional guidance on how States and LEAs should use paraprofessionals and assistants because States have the flexibility to determine whether to use them, and, if so, to determine the scope of their responsibilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended different requirements for paraprofessionals who perform routine tasks and those who perform specific activities to assist in the provision of special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not see the need to make a change to the regulations as suggested by the commenter because, under Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, SEAs have the responsibility for establishing and maintaining qualifications to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Furthermore, SEAs and LEAs have the flexibility to determine the tasks and activities to be performed by paraprofessionals and assistants, as long as they are consistent with the rights of children with disabilities to FAPE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It should be kept in mind, however, that the ESEA has different requirements for paraprofessionals, including special education paraprofessionals, who assist in instruction in title I schools versus paraprofessionals in title I schools who do not provide instructional support, such as special education paraprofessionals who solely provide personal care services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

While the Act does not address alternative routes to certification programs for related services personnel or other non-teaching personnel, there is nothing in the Act or the regulations that would preclude a State from providing for alternate routes for certification for related services personnel or other non-teaching personnel.  It is, however, up to a State to determine whether related services or non-teaching personnel participating in alternative routes to certification programs meet personnel requirements established by the State, consistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.156 and section 612(a)(14) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that Sec. 300.156 provide more guidance to ensure that States and LEAs implement proven strategies for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel.  A few commenters stated that this is especially important for speech-language pathologists because large caseloads, increased paperwork, and lack of time for planning and collaboration have been shown to contribute to their burn out and attrition.  Several commenters recommended that strategies to recruit and retain qualified personnel include reasonable workloads, improved working conditions, incentive programs, salary supplements, loan forgiveness, tuition assistance, signing bonuses, streamlined application processes, State and national advertising venues, school and university partnerships, release time for professional development, certification reciprocity between States, grants to LEAs for recruitment and retention programs, alternate professional preparation models, caseload size standards, and classroom size standards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The list of strategies recommended by the commenters includes many strategies that may be effective in recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel; however, we do not believe it is appropriate to include these or other strategies in our regulations because recruitment and retention strategies vary depending on the unique needs of each State and LEA.  States and LEAs are in the best position to determine the most effective recruitment and retention strategies for their location.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment regarding the applicability of Sec. 300.156(d) to paraprofessionals who provide special education and related services, Sec. 300.156(d), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(C) of the Act, applies to all personnel who provide special education and related services under the Act, including paraprofessionals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We agree that the rules of construction in both proposed Sec. 300.156(e) and proposed Sec. 300.18(e) must be revised so that both rules are the same.  The changes will clarify that a parent or student may not file a due process complaint on behalf of a student, or file a judicial action on behalf of a class of students for the failure of a particular SEA or LEA employee to be highly qualified; however, a parent may file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA.  In addition to permitting a parent to file a State complaint with the SEA, an organization or an individual may also file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, consistent with the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.  We believe that this is appropriate given the wording of section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act "...or to prevent a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the State educational agency" and incorporated in the regulations in Sec. 300.156(e) and new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)).

There is nothing in the Act or these regulations, however, which would prevent an SEA or LEA from adopting such a policy should it wish to do so.

The ESEA requires that at the beginning of each school year, an LEA that accepts title I, part A funding must notify parents of students in title I schools that they can request information regarding their children's classroom teachers, including, at a minimum:  (1) whether the teacher has met the State requirements for licensure and certification for the grade levels and subject-matters in which the teacher provides instruction; (2) whether the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which State qualification or licensing criteria have been waived; (3) the college major and any other graduate certification or degree held by the teacher, and the field of discipline of the certification or degree; and (4) whether the child is provided services by paraprofessionals, and if so, their qualifications.  In addition, each title I school must provide each parent timely notice that the parent's child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who is not highly qualified.  These requirements apply only to special education teachers who teach core academic subjects in Title I schools.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Assessment of students with disabilities under the IDEA. To ensure a coordinated administration of the IDEA and Title I programs, the final IDEA regulations on assessment in Sec.  300.160, which are included in this regulations package, incorporate provisions regarding modified academic achievement standards that are consistent with the changes to the regulations under Title I of the ESEA. In addition, the final IDEA regulations provide that a State's (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA's) guidelines must require each child to be validly assessed and must identify, for each assessment, accommodations that would result in an invalid score. Consistent with Title I, these final regulations also provide in Sec.  300.160(f)(1) that a student taking an assessment with an accommodation that invalidates the score would not be reported as a participant under the IDEA. This coordination of the regulations for the IDEA and Title I programs should avoid confusion among parents, teachers, and administrators, and reinforce IDEA's and Title I's shared goal of high expectations and accountability for all students.

</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
    Discussion: Section 612(a)(16)(A) of the IDEA is clear that all children must participate in State as well as district-wide assessments. This has been a requirement since the 1997 reauthorization of the IDEA. LEAs that conduct district-wide assessments must provide an alternate assessment for children who cannot participate in the district-wide assessment even with accommodations. Identifying the manner in which an LEA meets this requirement, however, is a matter that is best determined by State and local officials.

Comment: One commenter recommended requiring benchmarks or short-term objectives to be developed for students with disabilities participating in alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the IDEA requires benchmarks or short-term objectives to be included only in the IEPs of children with disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. Alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards are not alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. Therefore, we do not believe that benchmarks or short-term objectives should be required for children with disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards. Congress specifically limited the requirement for benchmarks and short-term objectives to the IEPs of children with the most significant cognitive disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. As the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions noted in Sen. Rep. No. 108-185 (p. 28), ``Short-term objectives and benchmarks can focus too much on minor details and distract from the real purpose of special education, which is to ensure that all children and youth with disabilities achieve high educational outcomes and are prepared to participate fully in the social and economic fabric of their communities.''
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that students participating in alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards will benefit more when IEP Teams focus on goals that are based on grade-level content standards, rather than on short-term objectives or benchmarks. In the discussion of comments under Sec.  200.1(e)(2)(iii) in this notice, we explain why we are requiring that the IEPs of children taking alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards include goals based on the academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and that the IEP be designed to monitor the student's progress in achieving the student's standards-based goals.

Comment: A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that accommodations that invalidate a score when used in an assessment may continue to be used in classroom instruction. Other commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the accommodation guidelines are to be used by IEP Teams to recommend necessary and reasonable accommodations to enable a student to participate both in the instructional program and in the assessment.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The requirements in Sec.  300.160(b) pertain to guidelines for the use of accommodations in assessments, and do not speak to the use of accommodations in the classroom. However, there is nothing in the IDEA or these regulations that would prohibit the use of accommodations in classroom instruction that, if used in a State assessment, would invalidate a student's score. Likewise, there is nothing in the IDEA or these regulations that would prohibit a State from encouraging IEP Teams to use the accommodation guidelines for assessments to determine the instructional supports to be provided in the classroom. Such instructional supports are generally referred to as supplementary aids and services. Section 300.320(a)(4)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)(aa) of the IDEA, requires the IEP Team to identify the supplementary aids and services to be provided to a child to enable the child to advance appropriately toward meeting the child's annual IEP goals.

</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter recommended requiring States and LEAs to have methodologies in place to determine that the accommodations provided are valid and reliable and can be objectively determined. A few commenters recommended requiring a State to submit proposed accommodations for review and approval by a panel of peer reviewers.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The Department's peer review of Statewide assessment systems under Title I of the ESEA already requires a State to provide evidence that the State's assessments are valid and reliable for the purposes for which the assessments are used, and are consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards. A State must also provide evidence that appropriate accommodations are available to students with disabilities.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
For State and LEA assessments that are not part of a State's assessment system under Title I of the ESEA, a State and its LEAs also have an obligation, under the IDEA, to ensure that children with disabilities have available the accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child. In order to do this, States and LEAs need to determine, for each particular assessment, the accommodations that will not result in invalid scores and identify those accommodations in their accommodation guidelines. We have revised Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(i) to make this clear.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The IDEA does not dictate a specific process to be followed in determining allowable accommodations, and, therefore, we decline to adopt the recommendations that we do so at this time. We will continue to evaluate whether States are ensuring that accommodations that would not result in invalid scores are available and revisit this decision if the need to do so becomes apparent.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The commenters who recommended requiring a State to submit proposed accommodations for review and approval by a panel of peer reviewers seem to be proposing a review to determine the appropriateness of accommodations that would be divorced from any review of the technical qualities of the State's assessments. Since decisions about whether a particular accommodation is or is not allowed depend on how a test is constructed and validated, we are not making the requested change. As required by Sec.Sec.200.2(b)(2) and 200.6(a)(1), a State already is under the obligation to ensure that its assessments under Title I of the ESEA are designed to be used by the widest possible number of students, and to ensure that accommodations are provided, when necessary, to measure the academic achievement of students with disabilities.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: Section 300.160(b)(2)(i) has been changed to require a State's guidelines (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA's guidelines) to identify the accommodations for each assessment that do not invalidate the score.

Comment: One commenter noted that the regulations must continue to allow IEP Teams to select accommodations based on the needs of their students, without regard to whether the accommodation could yield a valid score.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Several sections of the IDEA must be considered to evaluate the proper role of a State in identifying accommodations that do not invalidate the scores of children with disabilities (and result in children being counted as nonparticipants) and the responsibility of individual IEP Teams to select accommodations for individual children.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Under section 612(a)(16) of the IDEA, a State has a responsibility to ensure that all children with disabilities are included in State and district-wide assessments. Under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI) of the IDEA and Sec.  300.320(a)(6)(i) of the IDEA regulations, a child's IEP must include the individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A State's role in this regard is thus twofold--it must ensure that children with disabilities are included in the assessments and that the accommodations that are offered to individual children with disabilities are ones that allow a child's academic achievement to be measured. This carries with it, we believe, a responsibility for each State to clearly identify for IEP Teams those accommodations that, if used, will not result in an invalid score, so that children with disabilities will be appropriately included in assessments. Therefore, as noted earlier, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(i) to require State and LEA guidelines to identify the accommodations for each assessment that do not result in invalid scores. We also believe that, to meet its responsibility to ensure that children with disabilities are included in assessments, a State needs to instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores. The child's IEP Team, though, remains the primary decisionmaker for the accommodations that will be made available to the child. Therefore, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(ii) to make clear that State and LEA guidelines must instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores.

Comment: Several commenters stated that a State's accommodation guidelines should focus on ``appropriate accommodations'' and not require ``valid accommodations.'' These commenters stated that the focus should be on universally-designed assessments that allow many more accommodations, rather then denying children with disabilities the right to use the accommodations that are necessary to meet the child's needs. Another commenter recommended defining ``appropriate accommodations'' and ``individually appropriate accommodations'' as accommodations that are needed to meet a child's unique needs that maintain and preserve test validity, reliability, and technical testing standards.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Tests administered with accommodations that do not maintain test validity are not measuring academic achievement and functional performance. Therefore, providing these accommodations would be inconsistent with Sec.  300.320(a)(6)(i) and section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the IDEA, which require each IEP to include the appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic and functional performance of a child on State and district-wide assessments. With regard to the recommendation that a State focus on universally designed assessments, new Sec.  300.160(g) (proposed Sec.  300.160(f)) already incorporates the requirement in section 612(a)(16)(E) of the IDEA that a State, in the case of Statewide assessments, and an LEA, in the case of district-wide assessments, to the extent possible, use universal design in developing and implementing assessments. Moreover, Sec.  200.2(b)(2) of the Title I regulations requires a State's assessment system to ``[b]e designed to be valid and accessible for use by the widest possible range of students, including students with disabilities.''
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is not necessary to provide specific definitions of the terms &#8220;appropriate accommodations&#8221; and &#8220;individually appropriate Accommodations&#8221; because we have revised the provisions in Sec. 300.160(b) to clarify what the accommodations guidelines need to include.

Comment: One commenter requested that the regulations require a State and its LEAs to provide research-based decision-making tools for IEP Team members to determine appropriate testing accommodations.

</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We do not believe that additional regulations are necessary to address the commenters' concerns. Section 300.160(b) already requires each State (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) to develop guidelines for IEP Teams to use regarding the provision of appropriate accommodations. Section 200.6(a)(1)(ii)(B) of the Title I regulations also requires each State to ensure that regular and special education teachers, and other appropriate staff know how to administer assessments, including making appropriate use of accommodations for students with disabilities.

The Department has devoted considerable resources to provide technical assistance to States regarding the appropriate use of accommodations for children with disabilities.

Comment: One commenter recommended requiring a State to have in effect policies and procedures that explain how children with disabilities are included in assessments. The commenter stated that the policies and procedures related to assessments must include a clear statement that the IEP Team, including the parent, makes the decision regarding a child's participation in State and district-wide assessments; how parents will be notified when decisions regarding the child's participation in assessments will be made; and when reports will be distributed to parents and the public. A few commenters requested that the regulations require the IEP to include the accommodations to be provided to a child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The requirements recommended by the commenters are already addressed in these and other existing regulations. Section 300.160(a), consistent with section 612(a)(16) of the IDEA, requires each State to have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities in the State are included in State and district-wide assessments, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments where necessary. Section 300.320(a)(6), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI) of the IDEA, requires a child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, to include in the IEP any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child on State and district-wide assessments. If the IEP Team determines that a child will take an alternate assessment, the IEP Team must explain why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and why the particular alternate assessment selected is appropriate for the child. Section 300.322(b) requires that the notice to the parent regarding an IEP Team meeting indicate the purpose of the meeting, in addition to the time and location of the meeting. Finally, new Sec.300.160(f) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)) requires that reports on the performance of children with disabilities on State and district-wide assessments be available to the public with the same frequency and in the same detail as reports on the assessment of nondisabled children.

Comment: One commenter stated that the requirement for valid accommodations will lead to increased litigation because it violates section 607(a) and (b) of the IDEA.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree with the commenter. Section 607(a) of the IDEA states that the Secretary shall issue regulations only to the extent that such regulations are necessary to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of the IDEA. Section 607(b) of the IDEA provides that the Secretary cannot publish final regulations that would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to children with disabilities in the regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983, except to the extent that such regulations reflect the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress in legislation. We believe that Sec.300.160(a) is necessary to ensure that the requirements in sections 612(a)(16) and 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the IDEA are met, does not lessen protections for children with disabilities that were in regulations in effect in 1983 (the 1983 regulations did not address assessments), and reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress. Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the IDEA requires each IEP Team to include in an IEP the appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic and functional performance of a child on State and district-wide assessments. Tests administered with accommodations that do not maintain test validity are not measuring academic achievement.  Moreover, the importance of identifying valid accommodations was
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
recognized on page 97 of the House Committee Report No. 108-77 (2003):
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
* * * States have an affirmative obligation to determine what types of accommodations can be made to assessments while maintaining their reliability and validity
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
* * *. The Committee is intent on ensuring that each child with a disability receives appropriate accommodations, but is equally intent that these accommodations not invalidate the particular assessment.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Similarly, the Senate Committee Report No. 108-185 (2003) on page30 acknowledges that appropriate accommodations will not affect the test's validity. Accordingly, we disagree that the validation requirement violates section 607(a) or (b) of the IDEA.

Comment: One commenter requested a definition of ``valid.'' Another commenter stated that the regulations should make clear that accommodations that alter the construct being assessed are not allowed.

Discussion: As used in Sec.300.160(a), a ``valid'' accommodation is an accommodation that does not alter the construct that the test is intended to measure. Accommodations that affect test validity do not measure a child's academic achievement. We believe the requirement for valid accommodations is sufficient to guide IEP Teams and, therefore, decline to add the suggested language to the regulation.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Department's nonregulatory guidance on standards and assessment defines validity (See question F-4.) and further clarifies a State's responsibilities for the validity and reliability of assessments under Title I. This document can be found at http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/saaguidance03.doc.  We do not believe additional clarification is needed in these regulations.

Comment: Several commenters requested that definitions of &#8220;accommodations&#8221; and &#8220;modifications&#8221; be included in these regulations because definitions of these two terms vary across States.

Discussion: The terms &#8220;accommodations&#8221; and &#8220;modifications&#8221; are terms of art and have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. The terms are used in a number of ways, for example, to refer to changes to a test or testing environment, or to adaptations to an educational environment, the presentation of educational material, the method of response, or the educational content. We do not believe it is appropriate to define such terms of art in these regulations. We also note that the term &#8220;modifications&#8221; is not used in the IDEA amendments of 2004 or the ESEA, as amended by NCLB.

Comment: One commenter stated that the regulations must specify that States and LEAs are required to develop two alternate assessments--one measuring the same academic achievement standards as all other students and the other based on alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. A few commenters requested clarification as to whether alternate assessments are based on high academic achievement standards or alternate academic achievement standards. One commenter stated that a State should be required to provide a definition of what constitutes an alternate assessment.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 612(a)(16)(C)(i) of the IDEA is clear that a State must develop and implement alternate assessments and guidelines for children with disabilities, but does not specify whether the alternate assessments must be based on grade-level academic achievement standards, modified academic achievement standards, or alternate academic achievement standards. Modified academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(e) and alternate academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(d) are optional. However, having an alternate assessment is not optional if there are children with disabilities who cannot be appropriately assessed with the regular assessment. Therefore, if a State chooses not to develop an alternate assessment based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, the State must have an alternate assessment based on grade-level academic achievement standards, unless all children with disabilities can be appropriately assessed using the regular assessment.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 612(a)(16)(A) of the IDEA and Sec.300.160(a) of these regulations require a state to ensure that all children with disabilities are included in general State and district-wide assessments. Section 612(a)(16)(C)(i) of the IDEA and new Sec.300.160(c) (proposed Sec.300.160(d)) further require that a State (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) develop and implement alternate assessments and guidelines for children with disabilities who cannot participate in regular assessments even with accommodations. Under Sec.Sec.200.1(e) and 200.6(a)(3) of the Title I regulations published in this notice and new Sec.300.160(c), a State has the option of developing alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards. For clarity, we have redesignated proposed Sec.300.160(c) as new Sec.300.160(c)(2)(ii) so that it is clear that an assessment based on modified academic achievement standards is an alternate assessment.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Because a State has options regarding the type of alternate assessments that it will provide for students with disabilities, a State would not necessarily report on the number of students who participated in each of the alternate assessments. To acknowledge this and for clarity, we have made clear in new Sec.300.160(f)(2) through (f)(4) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)(2) through (e)(4)) that a State must report the number of children with disabilities, if any, who are assessed, using an Alternate assessment based on grade-level, modified, or alternate academic achievement standards, respectively. We also have removed the regulatory citations for the different academic achievement standards (e.g., &#8220;described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)&#8221;) and added the name of the particular achievement standard to which we are referring (e.g., &#8220;grade-level&#8221;) in new Sec.300.160(f)(2) through (f)(4) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)(2) through (e)(4)).
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the request to clarify whether alternate assessments are based on high achievement standards or alternate academic achievement standards, this will depend on the type of alternate assessment. We believe that the regulations are clear that there are three types of alternate assessments permitted under Title I and the IDEA: alternate assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards; Alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards; and alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary for a State to provide a definition of what constitutes an alternate assessment, as requested by one commenter. New Sec.300.160(c)(2) (proposed Sec.300.160(d)(2)) clearly lays out that alternate assessments under Title I of the ESEA must be aligned with a State's challenging academic content standards and challenging academic achievement standards and, if a State has adopted modified academic achievement standards or alternate academic achievement standards, measure student achievement against those standards.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: We have (1) redesignated proposed Sec.300.160(c) as new Sec.300.160(c)(2)(ii) and renumbered the subsequent paragraph; (2) added ``if any'' following ``number of children with disabilities'' in new paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) (proposed paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4)); and (3) replaced the regulatory citation in new paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) (proposed (e)(2) through (e)(4)) with the name of the particular academic achievement standards to which we are referring.

Comment: Several commenters recommended requiring public agencies to notify parents in writing when a child's IEP Team determines that the child will participate in an alternate assessment. A few commenters recommended requiring parents to be informed in writing of the consequences of their child taking an alternate assessment, including any effect on the child's eligibility for graduation with a regular high school diploma. The commenters stated that providing this information to parents is particularly important in a State that requires students to pass a State exam in order to receive a regular high school diploma.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree that it is important for parents to be informed that their child will be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. We also believe that it is important that parents, as well as other IEP Team members, are informed about any effects of State or local policies on their student's education that may result from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. As the commenters point out, this information is particularly important in a State where students must pass a particular assessment to be eligible to receive a regular high school diploma. Therefore, we have added a regulation requiring a State to provide IEP Teams, which include the parent, with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify a student for a regular high school diploma). We also have required a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based those standards. This also is consistent with Sec.200.1(f)(1)(iii) and (iv) of the Title I regulations.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to add an additional requirement that such parental notification be provided in writing, as suggested by several commenters. Parents are integral members of the IEP Team and, as such, are involved in decisions about how their child will participate in the Statewide assessment system. Section 300.320(a)(6)(ii) of the IDEA regulations already provides that, if an IEP Team determines that a child will not participate in a particular regular State or district-wide assessment, the child's IEP must include a statement of why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and how that child will be assessed. Under Sec.300.322(f), a copy of the child's IEP must be provided to the parents.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: We have added new paragraph (d) to Sec.300.160 requiring a State to provide IEP Teams with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify the student for a regular high school diploma). We also have added a new paragraph (e) requiring a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. The subsequent paragraph has been redesignated as new paragraph (f).

Comment: A few commenters stated that accommodations that invalidate a test score should not be used and, therefore, it is unnecessary to qualify in new Sec.300.160(f)(1) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)(1)) that the number of children participating in regular assessments who were provided with accommodations refers to the number of children participating in regular assessments who were provided with accommodations &#8220;that did not result in an invalid score.&#8221;
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree that accommodations that invalidate a test score should not be used. However, given the lack of consistency in the field regarding the use of the term ``accommodations,'' we believe it is important to be clear and to qualify in new Sec.300.160(f)(1) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)(1)) that reports on the assessment of  children with disabilities who participate in regular assessments with accommodations include only those children who were provided with accommodations that did not result in an invalid score. For clarity, we also have reordered the sequence in which the alternate assessments are listed in new paragraph (f) (proposed paragraph (e)) to be consistent with the order in new Sec.300.160(c)(2) (proposed Sec.300.160(d)(2)).

To alleviate burden, Congress removed the statutory provisions which required that States have policies and procedures on file with the Secretary to ensure that funds paid to the State under Part B of the Act are spent in accordance with the provisions of Part B.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to retain in the regulations the requirements in current Sec.

We also believe retaining the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.280 through 300.284 would place unnecessary regulatory burden on States.  Section 300.165(a) incorporates the language in section 612(a)(19) of the Act, regarding public participation in the adoption of policies and procedures to implement Part B of the Act, and requires States to ensure that there are public hearings, adequate notice of hearings, and an opportunity for comment available to the general public.  Furthermore, paragraph (b) of this section requires States to comply with the public participation requirements of GEPA, in 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(7), before submitting a State plan under this part.  In accordance with the GEPA requirement, the State must assure that it will provide reasonable opportunities for participation by local agencies, representatives of the class of individuals affected by programs under this part and other interested institutions, organizations, and individuals in the planning for the operation of programs under this part.  GEPA also requires that the State publish each proposed State plan under this part, in a manner that will ensure circulation throughout the State, at least 60 days prior to the date on which the State plan is submitted to the Secretary or on which the State plan becomes effective, whichever occurs earlier, with an opportunity for public comments on such plan to be accepted for at least 30 days.

Discussion:  We do not think it is appropriate or necessary to include in the regulations a definition of "adequate notice" because what constitutes "adequate notice" will vary depending on the unique circumstances in each State and we believe States should have the flexibility of determining and applying a workable and reasonable standard that meets their circumstances to ensure public participation at public hearings.  We believe it would be reasonable for the State to assume that it provided adequate notice if, at its public hearings, there were sufficient representatives of the general public, including individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities, in attendance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended retaining the procedures to govern State advisory panels in current Sec. 300.653 and strengthening the requirements of notice and opportunity for public comment at State advisory panel meetings by mandating publication of meeting dates, agendas, and minutes on Web sites.  A few commenters stated that eliminating the notice requirements and the opportunity to participate in meetings in current Sec. 300.653(d) and (e) will result in fewer low income, hearing-impaired, and foreign-language speaking parents attending State advisory panel meetings.  One commenter expressed concern that the removal of current Sec. 300.653 will result in less panel visibility, less public participation, and that State advisory panels will become "rubber-stamps" for positions taken by State officials.  One commenter stated that the removal of the requirements in current Sec. 300.653 weakens the protection of children with disabilities, and, therefore, violates section 607(b) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements in current Sec. 300.653 were removed to provide greater State flexibility in the operation of advisory panels.  We do not believe the removal of current Sec. 300.653 will mean that the States will not ensure that State advisory panel meetings are announced in advance and open to the public because States generally have adequate sunshine laws that ensure public access to governmental agency meetings.  We do not believe it is necessary to require that information regarding State advisory panel meetings be posted on State Web sites because sunshine laws generally contain provisions regarding meeting notices, agendas, and the availability of minutes of public meetings.  However, it is important that individuals consult the laws governing their State and locality on the issue of open meetings and public access.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 607(b)(2) of the Act provides that the Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation pursuant to the Act that procedurally or substantively lessens the protections provided to children with disabilities as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983.  We do not believe removing from these regulations the requirements in current Sec. 300.653 procedurally or substantively lessens the protections provided to children with disabilities pursuant to section 607(b)(2) of the Act because we do not view public notice of advisory committee meetings to be a protection provided to children with disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  We received numerous, specific requests to revise Sec. 300.168 to add to the list of individuals who can serve as members of the State advisory panels.  Some commenters recommended requiring State advisory panels to include representatives from the Parent Training and Information Centers and Community Parent Resource Centers funded by the Department under sections 671 and 672 of the Act because their representation would ensure a diverse group of people experienced with children with different disabilities on the panels.  One commenter expressed concern that, without representation from these groups, panel members would make recommendations based solely on their individual circumstances and backgrounds.  A few commenters requested including school psychologists and other student support staff on State advisory panels.  One commenter suggested including a representative of a residential treatment facility as a member on State advisory panels because children in these facilities are a growing population and have specialized needs.  A few commenters requested adding representatives from centers for independent living because these individuals are experienced in advocating for people with disabilities.  One commenter suggested including State coordinators for education of homeless children and youth.  A few commenters suggested including disabled high school and postsecondary students on the list because the intended beneficiaries of the Act are often denied a voice.  A few commenters proposed requiring each State advisory panel to be racially, culturally, linguistically, and socio-economically representative of the State.  One commenter expressed concern that the new regulations could lead States to abruptly replace current panel members causing discontinuity and decreasing expertise, and recommended phasing in the new requirements and allowing panel members to complete their terms of office. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The membership of State advisory panels is described in section 612(a)(21)(B) and (C) of the Act and the Department does not agree that there is a need to require additional representatives or to change the panel composition.  However, nothing in the Act or these regulations would prevent the appointment of additional representatives, if a State elected to add these individuals.  With respect to the request to include State coordinators for education of homeless children on the panels, State and local officials who carry out activities under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act are already included in the list of individuals identified to serve on the State advisory panels in Sec. 300.168(a)(5).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 612(a)(21)(B) of the Act, as reflected in Sec. 300.168, requires the State advisory panel to be representative of the State population and be composed of individuals involved in, or concerned with, the education of children with disabilities.  Also, the Act and these regulations require a majority of the panel members to be individuals with disabilities or parents of children with disabilities (ages birth through 26).  We also do not believe there is a need to phase in the new requirements, as those members that do not need to change should provide sufficient continuity of panel functions. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring States to submit any rules or regulations related to children with disabilities to the State advisory panel for consideration before the rules are finalized.  One commenter requested requiring panel members to take positions on State proposed rules and regulations regarding the education of children with disabilities and offer their views to the appropriate State agencies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(21)(D) of the Act clearly specifies the duties of the State advisory panel and these duties are accurately reflected in Sec. 300.169.  Paragraph (b) of this section clarifies that the advisory panel must comment publicly on any State proposed rules or regulations regarding the education of children with disabilities.  We believe Sec. 300.169(b) is sufficient to ensure that the advisory panel has the opportunity to consider any State rules or regulations before they are final and, accordingly, further regulatory language is unnecessary.  Further, we believe it is inappropriate to require that panel members "take positions" on proposed rules and regulations because to do so would be overly controlling of the advisory panel and may impact the panel's ability to effectively meet its statutory responsibility of providing public comment on State proposed rules and regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters suggested retaining current Sec. 300.652(b), which requires State advisory panels to provide advice for educating students with disabilities in adult correctional facilities.  A few of these commenters noted that students in adult correctional facilities are members of one of the most vulnerable populations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Given the breadth of the State advisory panel's statutory responsibilities we removed from the regulations all nonstatutory mandates on the State advisory panel, including the provision in current Sec. 300.652(b), regarding advising on the education of eligible students with disabilities who have been convicted as adults and have been incarcerated in adult prisons.  We believe placing such nonstatutory mandates on the State advisory panel may hinder the advisory panel's ability to effectively provide policy guidance with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities in the State.  There is nothing, however, that would prevent a State from assigning other responsibilities to its State advisory panel, as long as those other duties do not prevent the advisory panel from carrying out its responsibilities under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended including the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS) in these regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter.  The final NIMAS was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084) and will be included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard of these regulations.  We will add language in Sec. 300.172(a) to refer to this location and to reference the publication date of the NIMAS in the Federal Register.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  The final NIMAS has been added as appendix C to part 300.  We have added language in Sec. 300.172(a) to refer to the location of the NIMAS in these regulations and the publication date of the NIMAS in the Federal Register.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that the language requiring States to adopt the NIMAS "in a timely manner" is ambiguous and could lead to delays in providing instructional materials to children with disabilities, inconsistencies across States, and increased litigation.  Several commenters requested that the regulations specify a timeline for States to adopt the NIMAS.  Some commenters recommended requiring all States to adopt the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  However, one commenter stated that States should not be given a deadline to adopt the NIMAS.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A number of commenters requested that the regulations define the meaning of "adopt" in Sec. 300.172(a) and specify what States must do to adopt the NIMAS.  Several commenters recommended defining "adopt" to mean that the State, through regulatory or legislative procedures, designates NIMAS as the only required source format for publishers to convert print instructional materials into specialized formats for children with disabilities.  One commenter urged the Department to define "adopt" to mean that a State must accept a NIMAS file as satisfying the publisher's legal obligation to provide accessible instructional materials.  Other commenters recommended that the regulations clearly state that adoption of the NIMAS means that SEAs and LEAs must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format that are provided by the publishers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.172(a), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(A) of the Act, requires States to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner after the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  As noted in the discussion to the previous comment, the NIMAS is included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard and was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084).  The Department believes that States should make every effort to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner following the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register, recognizing that the timelines and requirements for adopting new rules, policies, or procedures vary from State to State.  States choosing to coordinate with the NIMAC must, consistent with section 612(a)(23)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.172(c) of these regulations, not later than December 3, 2006, as part of any print instructional materials adoption process, procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the publisher of the print instructional materials to:  (1) require the publisher to prepare and, on or before delivery of the print instructional materials, provide the NIMAC with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the NIMAS; or (2) purchase instructional materials from the publisher that are produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.  Clearly, we would expect that these States would have adopted the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  We decline to require a specific adoption date for all States, however, given the lack of specificity in the Act.  We also decline to include a definition of "adopt" in these regulations because requirements for adopting new rules and policies may vary from State to State.  The Department's view is that it is inherent in the adoption requirement that, at a minimum, upon "adoption" of the NIMAS, a State must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  Under Sec. 300.172(a), adopting the NIMAS is a State responsibility and does not impose any legal obligations on publishers of instructional materials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have made technical changes in Sec. 300.172(c).  For clarity, we have replaced the phrase "not later than" with "as of."  We have removed the phrase "two years after the date of enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004" because it is unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring States to comply with the requirements for public hearings and public comment in section 612(a)(19) of the Act before adopting policies and procedures to implement the requirements in Sec. 300.172 related to access to instructional materials.  The commenter stated that all interested members of the public, including parents of children with disabilities, are entitled to participate in designing the plan for implementing these policies and procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.165(a), consistent with section 612(a)(19) of the Act, requires States to hold public hearings and receive public comment before implementing any policies and procedures needed to comply with Part B of the Act.

Comment:  One commenter requested clarification on whether the NIMAS is limited to print materials on the medium of paper or also includes the iconic representation of letters and words.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The NIMAS is the standard established by the Secretary to be used in the preparation of electronic files of print instructional materials so they can be more easily converted to accessible formats, such as Braille.  In addition to print materials, the NIMAS provides standards for textbooks and related core materials where icons replace text.  Materials with icons will be available if they are in printed textbooks and related printed core materials that are written and published primarily for use in elementary school and secondary school instruction and are required by an SEA or LEA for use by children in the classroom, consistent with section 674(e)(3)(C) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying that providing materials in accessible formats includes changes in the depth, breadth, and complexity of materials.  Some commenters stated that Sec. 300.172 should include language regarding universal design of instructional materials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.172 is consistent with section 612(a)(23) of the Act and focuses specifically on providing access to print instructional materials using the NIMAS.  The NIMAS is designed to improve the quality and consistency of print instructional materials converted into accessible formats for persons who are blind and persons with print disabilities, not to alter the content (e.g., the depth, breadth, or complexity) of the print instructional materials.  While the NIMAS is designed to make print instructional materials more readily and easily accessible to persons who are blind and persons with print disabilities, it is not intended to provide materials that are universally designed.  Therefore, while the Department acknowledges the importance of universal design, it would be inappropriate to reference universal design in this section.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The NIMAS Development Center has been charged with examining the need for future changes in the NIMAS.  This Center, funded by the Department, is looking at a variety of issues, including the extent to which universal design features should be incorporated into future iterations of the NIMAS.  Information about the NIMAS Development Center can be found at:  http://nimas.cast.org/.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that books on tape be made available in the same manner as print materials.  Discussion:  The conversion of text to speech for digital talking books is one of the accessible formats that can be generated from a NIMAS file.  The NIMAS makes it possible for such talking books to be generated more efficiently so that children who need them will receive them more quickly than in the past.  Such audio formats will be made available for printed textbooks and related printed core materials that are written and published primarily for use in elementary school and secondary school instruction and are required by an SEA or LEA for use by children in the classroom, consistent with section 674(e)(3)(C) of the Act.  The NIMAS does not pertain to books on tape that are produced in sound studios.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters requested that the regulations specify that providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner means providing these materials at the same time they are provided to children without disabilities.  One commenter recommended defining "in a timely manner" as the start of the school year or, for children who transfer schools after the start of the school year, within 30 days of the start of the school year, regardless of whether a State chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department agrees that States should make every effort to provide children with disabilities accessible instructional materials at the same time as other children receive their instructional materials.  The Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 19, which states, "The committee feels strongly that instructional materials should be provided to blind and print disabled students at the same time their fellow students without print disabilities are receiving the same materials."  This position also is consistent with H. Rpt. No. 108-77, pp. 97-98.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have amended paragraph (b) in Sec. 300.172 by adding a new paragraph (b)(4) requiring the SEA to ensure that all public agencies take all reasonable steps to provide instructional materials in accessible formats to children with disabilities who need those instructional materials at the same time as other children receive instructional materials.  We have reorganized paragraph (c) and added a new paragraph (c)(2) requiring States that coordinate with the NIMAC to provide accessible materials in a timely manner.  We have also amended paragraph (e) by adding a new paragraph (e)(2) to clarify that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e)(1) apply to each SEA and LEA whether or not the SEA or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.  We have made technical changes to Sec. 300.172(e) and renumbered Sec. 300.172(e) to be consistent with this change.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the regulations fail to ensure timely access to instructional materials for children with other types of disabilities besides print disabilities.  One commenter recommended clarifying that children do not have to be blind or have print disabilities to fit into the description of children who need accessible materials.  However, another commenter stated that Sec. 300.172(b)(3), which require SEAs to be responsible for providing accessible materials for children for whom assistance is not available from the NIMAC, should be removed because the Act does not include these requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters requested adding a regulation to clarify that the requirements in Sec. 300.172 do not apply if an SEA is not responsible for purchasing textbooks.  The commenters stated that if an SEA cannot purchase textbooks, it has no legal relationship with textbook publishers and cannot comply with the requirements in Sec. 300.172.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Timely access to appropriate and accessible instructional materials is an inherent component of a public agency's obligation under the Act to ensure that FAPE is available for children with disabilities and that children with disabilities participate in the general curriculum as specified in their IEPs.  Section 300.172(b)(3) provides that nothing relieves an SEA of its responsibility to ensure that children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats, but who do not fall within the category of children who are eligible to receive materials produced from NIMAS files obtained through the NIMAC, receive those instructional materials in a timely manner.  Therefore, we do not believe that any further clarification is necessary.  Even SEAs that are not directly responsible for purchasing textbooks have this responsibility.  In short, we believe these regulations are necessary to fully implement the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that all children with disabilities should receive assistance from the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  Section 674(e) of the Act limits the authority of the NIMAC to provide assistance to SEAs and LEAs in acquiring instructional materials for children who are blind, have visual disabilities, or are unable to read or use standard print materials because of physical limitations, and children who have reading disabilities that result from organic dysfunction, as provided for in 36 CFR 701.6.  Clearly, SEAs and LEAs that choose to use the services of the NIMAC will be able to assist blind persons or other persons with print disabilities who need accessible instructional materials through this mechanism.  However, SEAs and LEAs still have an obligation to provide accessible instructional materials in a timely manner to other children with disabilities who also may need accessible materials even though their SEA or LEA may not receive assistance from the NIMAC, as provided in Sec. Sec. 300.172(b)(3) and 300.210(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern about allowing States to choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters stated that coordination with the NIMAC should be mandatory for all States.  One commenter recommended that the Department strongly encourage States to coordinate with the NIMAC, because it may be difficult for States to provide the assurances required in Sec. 300.172(b)(2) if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters recommended that States that cannot demonstrate a past history of providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner should be required to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inconsistent with section 612(a)(23)(B) of the Act to make coordination with the NIMAC mandatory for all States or to require certain States to coordinate with the NIMAC (e.g., States that do not have a history of providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner), as suggested by the commenters.  Section 612(a)(23)(B) of the Act provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to require any SEA to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested that the regulations clearly define the process for a State to choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters requested additional details on what assurances States must provide if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Other commenters requested that State assurances provide the public with information to evaluate the capacity of the State to provide materials to children who are blind or have print disabilities.  Some commenters stated that the assurances provided by States that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC should be done annually and in writing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters requested that the regulations provide a means for the public to obtain information about which States choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters requested that the Department publish the assurances made by SEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Some commenters stated that SEAs that choose to coordinate with the NIMAC should be required to provide information to the Department on the LEAs in the State that elect not to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.172(b)(2), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(B) of the Act, requires SEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC to provide an assurance to the Secretary that the agency will provide instructional materials to blind persons and other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.  As part of a State's application for Part B funds, Sec. 300.100 and section 612(a) of the Act require States to provide assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the State meets the conditions of eligibility.  (The Part B Annual State Application for 2006, OMB No. 1820-0030, can be found at:  http://www.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/osep/2006apps.html.)</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Therefore, the Department will compile a list of the States that choose to coordinate with the NIMAC and those that do not, and will make this list available on OSEP's monitoring Web site at:  http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/monitor/index.html.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 612(a)(23)(B) of the Act does not mandate that States coordinate with the NIMAC or place conditions on which States can choose to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to require a State's assurance to include information on its capacity to provide instructional materials to children who are blind or have print disabilities, as commenters recommended.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is appropriate to regulate to require States to provide information to the Department on the LEAs in the State that elect not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Under Sec. 300.149 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, States are responsible for ensuring that LEAs in the State meet the requirements of the Act, including providing instructional materials to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.  As stated in Sec. 300.210 and section 613(a)(6)(B) of the Act, if an LEA chooses not to coordinate with the NIMAC, the LEA must provide an assurance to the SEA that the LEA will provide instructional materials to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters proposed that the regulations require States that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC to annually report to the public on when children with disabilities receive their materials, how print materials are provided in a timely manner, and the steps the State has taken to ensure that materials will be provided at the same time as materials are provided to children without disabilities.  One commenter stated that, if a State chooses not to coordinate with the NIMAC, the State should be required to submit data to the Department on the number of children with print disabilities served by the State and when those children received the accessible version of print instructional materials compared with when other children received their materials.

Discussion:  It would be unfair to impose additional data collection and reporting requirements, such as those requested by the commenters, only on those States that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  All States, regardless of whether they choose to coordinate with the NIMAC, must ensure that children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats receive instructional materials in a timely manner, consistent with Sec. 300.172(b)(3).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Furthermore, even States that choose to coordinate with the NIMAC will need to take steps to ensure that the instructional materials for children eligible to receive print instructional materials derived from NIMAS files are received in a timely manner.  As provided in section 674(e)(3)(A) of the Act, the NIMAC is a distribution center for NIMAS files obtained from publishers, SEAs, and LEAs.  Section 612(a)(23) of the Act requires SEAs that choose to coordinate with the NIMAC to enter into written contracts with publishers to require the publishers to provide electronic files using the NIMAS to the NIMAC on, or before, delivery of the print instructional materials to the SEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The NIMAC is not responsible for converting NIMAS files to the accessible formats needed by the children eligible to receive print instructional materials derived from NIMAS files.

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require instructional materials provided to children with disabilities to be complete and accurate.

Discussion:  We understand and appreciate the importance of having a copy of the original material to ensure accuracy of the files.  However, the NIMAC is not responsible for ensuring the accuracy of materials, aligning page numbers, or describing pictures.  Rather, the NIMAC is a distribution center for NIMAS files obtained from publishers, SEAs, and LEAs.  Consistent with section 674(e)(3)(A) of the Act, the duties of the NIMAC are to receive and maintain a catalog of print instructional materials prepared in the NIMAS format and made available to the NIMAC by the textbook publishing industry, SEAs, and LEAs.  Accessible, student-ready versions of instructional materials are created from NIMAS source files by national third-party conversion organizations; regional or State conversion sources; desktop applications created by software developers; or curriculum publishers that produce accessible alternate format versions for direct sale to SEAs and LEAs.  The Act does not authorize the Department to impose obligations on such entities to provide accurate materials.  States and LEAs that contract with such entities, however, may wish to require the accuracy of such materials, including the alignment of page numbers and descriptions of pictures, as part of their agreements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Act does not require the NIMAC to provide assistance to SEAs if the SEA has chosen not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  However, there is nothing in the Act that would prevent the NIMAC from doing so.  As stated in section 674(e)(2)(B) of the Act, the NIMAC must provide access to print instructional materials, including textbooks, in accessible media, free of charge, to blind or other persons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools, in accordance with such terms and procedures as the NIMAC may prescribe.

Discussion:  We believe that it would be overly burdensome to require States to collect and report data on the timeliness, quality, and quantity of alternate formats provided to children with disabilities in order to track the availability of accessible materials for children with disabilities on a regional or national level.

The Department interprets "publish" to have the plain meaning of the word, which is to issue for sale or distribution to the public.  The NIMAC's duties, therefore, apply to print instructional materials made available to the public for sale after the NIMAS is published in the Federal Register.  However, this does not relieve SEAs and LEAs of their responsibility to provide accessible instructional materials in a timely manner, regardless of when the instructional materials were "published."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations do not specify the structure and operation of the NIMAC.  One commenter requested that the Department provide more information about the operation of the NIMAC.  Another commenter recommended that the NIMAC's management board include representatives of authorized entities.  One commenter requested information on the legal protections that the Department will provide to the NIMAC.  Another commenter requested specific information on the process and timing of the funding of the NIMAC.  One commenter recommended a timeline with a series of activities (e.g., establishment of a cooperative agreement, cost projections) to ensure that the NIMAC is operational.

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about clear guidance regarding electronic rights.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations require the NIMAC to develop a user agreement that any entity seeking access to a NIMAS file must sign.  The commenters stated that the agreement should detail the entities that are eligible under Federal copyright law and the Act to access the NIMAS files, the alternate formats that may be produced, and any other restrictions on the dissemination and use of NIMAS files.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that the regulations should require that the authorized entities have full, complete, and immediate access to deposited files and clarify that the authorized entities are responsible for reproducing the instructional materials in an accessible format and therefore, the files housed by the NIMAC should be free of charge.  Another commenter stated that the Department should ensure that NIMAS books are available to all authorized entities and the appropriate State organizations within five days after the books are deposited in the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate or necessary to regulate on the authorized entities eligible to have access to the NIMAS files.

Such procedures will address, for example, information regarding the authorized entities that are eligible to have access to NIMAS files, responsibilities of such authorized entities, and how and when access will be provided.

Section 612(a)(23)(D) of the Act does not refer to any particular assistive technology program.

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations do not provide sufficient guidance on what school personnel can communicate to parents regarding medication.  The commenters stated that in the absence of additional guidance, the regulations have the unintended effect of preventing school personnel from speaking openly with parents regarding classroom behavior, options for addressing behavior problems, and the impact of a child's medication on classroom behavior.  Further, the commenters requested that the regulations do more to encourage school personnel to recommend evaluations for children with behavior problems and communicate openly with parents about the effectiveness of treatment, and protect school personnel.

Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.174 provides sufficient guidance on what school personnel can and cannot communicate to parents regarding a child's medication.  Paragraph (a) clarifies that school personnel cannot require parents to obtain a prescription for medication for a child as a condition of attending school, receiving an evaluation to determine if a child is eligible for special education services, or receiving special education and related services under the Act.  Paragraph (b) clearly permits classroom personnel to speak with parents or guardians regarding a child's academic and functional performance, behavior in the classroom or school, or the need for an evaluation to determine the need for special education or related services. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe that further regulations are needed to encourage school personnel to recommend evaluations for children with behavior problems or to require school personnel to inform parents if they suspect a child's behavior may be related to a disability.

In paragraph (a), we have clarified that the statutory language means that a State must waive immunity in order to receive Part B funds.

Discussion: Consistent with section 606 of the Act, positive 
efforts must be made to recruit and advance qualified individuals with

to define the term ``positive efforts'' in these regulations because 
the positive efforts taken by States will vary based on the unique and 
individual needs of a State and public agency, and those needs may 
change over time. For example, a public agency's positive efforts might 
include participating in an employment fair that is targeted at 
individuals with disabilities, sending vacancy announcements to 
organizations for individuals with disabilities and ensuring that 
employees with disabilities are aware of promotion opportunities. As a 
separate obligation under Section 504, each recipient of assistance 
must provide reasonable accommodations, which may include assistive 
technology devices, to each qualified individual with a disability who 
applies for employment, or is employed in programs assisted under Part 
B of the Act.

Comment: One commenter opposed proposed Sec.  300.177 because, 
according to the commenter, section 606 of the Act is silent on the 
Department's authority to issue regulations relating to the employment 
of individuals with disabilities. The commenter argued that doing so would be contrary to Congress' intent, in section 607(a) of 
the Act, that the Secretary issue regulations only to the extent that 
such regulations are necessary to ensure compliance with the specific 
requirements of the IDEA. The commenter further noted that proposed 
Sec.  300.177(b) is unnecessary because in order to receive a grant 
under Part B of the IDEA, each State must already have on file with the 
Department a description of the steps the State proposes to take to 
ensure equitable access to, and participation in, activities conducted 
under Part B of the Act, as required by section 427 of the General 
Education Provisions Act (GEPA).
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter opposed this provision because the changes 
pertain to employment requirements rather than to the provision of 
special education. The commenter suggested that the Department provide 
guidance on this issue rather than include it in the regulations.

Discussion: Section 606 of the Act requires the Secretary to ensure 
that each recipient of assistance under Part B of the Act makes 
positive efforts to employ and advance in employment qualified 
individuals with disabilities in programs assisted under the Act. 
Section 300.177(b), consistent with section 606 of the Act, makes clear 
that this requirement applies to each recipient of Part B funds, 
including both SEAs and LEAs. This provision does not replace or 
contradict protections afforded to individuals with disabilities under 
other State or Federal laws, including requirements under GEPA, Section 
504, Title II of the ADA, and applicable employment laws. Additionally, 
Sec.  300.177(b) implements statutory provisions; the fact that it 
addresses employment matters rather than the provision of special 
education services does not mean that it should not be included in the 
regulations. The Department therefore declines to adopt the suggestion 
that this matter be addressed through guidance rather than through the 
regulations.

Comment: One commenter questioned whether the Department might add 
the provision in Sec.  300.177(b) as one of the Secretary's monitoring 
priorities for reporting by SEAs and LEAs in the SPP and APR.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: As previously discussed in this preamble, section 
616(a)(3) of the Act specifies the Department's IDEA monitoring 
priorities and requires the Secretary to monitor the States' 
performance in these priority areas using quantifiable indicators. At 
this time, the Department does not expect to include an additional 
indicator to monitor the implementation of the requirements in Sec.  
300.177(b).

Department Procedures (Sec. Sec. 300.178 through 300.186)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1541%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183, regarding the notice and hearing procedures before the Secretary determines a State is not eligible to receive a grant under Part B of the Act, are unnecessary and go beyond what is required in section 612(d) of the Act.  The commenter recommended removing Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 and including additional language in Sec. 300.178 clarifying that the Secretary has the authority to develop specific administrative procedures to determine if States meet statutory requirements for eligibility under Part B of the Act and that such procedures must include notification of eligibility or non-eligibility, an opportunity for a hearing, and an opportunity for appeal of the hearing decision.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department does not agree with the commenter that the notification and hearing procedures included in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 are unnecessary and go beyond what is required in section 612(d) of the Act.  Section 612(d)(2) of the Act states that the Secretary shall not make a final determination that a State is not eligible to receive a grant under this part until after providing the State with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing.  When the Secretary proposes to deny a State's eligibility to receive a grant under Part B of the Act, withhold funds, or take other enforcement action, it is important to all parties that the process through which those issues will be decided is clearly described, so that time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions instead of the underlying issues.  For these reasons, we believe it is important to retain Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 in the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Judicial review (Sec. 300.184)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1545%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that we clarify in the regulations the status of a State's operation of a program or eligibility to receive a grant under Part B of the Act while a final judicial decision is pending with respect to the State's eligibility under section 612 of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under section 612(a) of the Act, States must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for a grant under the Part B program.  Under section 612(d) of the Act, if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a final determination that a State is not eligible for a grant, the Secretary may not award funds to the State.  The procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 detail the process through which the Secretary notifies a State of a proposed ineligibility determination, the hearing available to the State to dispute this proposal, and the process through which the Secretary makes a final determination.  The Secretary's final determination may be appealed through the judicial review procedure described in section 616(e)(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.184.  We decline to address this issue more specifically in the regulations, however, as we think the regulations already adequately convey the idea that only States that the Secretary determines to be eligible can receive a grant.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

By-Pass for Children in Private Schools (Sec. Sec. 300.190 through 300.198)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1549%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. Sec. 300.190 through 300.198 are unnecessary because the Act gives sufficient authority for the Secretary to implement a by-pass for children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.190 retains the authority for a by-pass in current Sec. 300.480 and includes additional authority for a by-pass, consistent with section 612(f)(1) of the Act, in cases where the Secretary determines that an SEA, LEA, or public agency has substantially failed, or is unwilling, to provide for equitable participation of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  When the Secretary authorizes a by-pass it is important that all parties understand the process by which the Secretary determines the funds that will be deducted from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act to provide services, as well as the actions that are required before the Secretary takes any final action to implement a by-pass.  When such processes and procedures are clearly described, time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions.  The requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.190 through 300.198 provide this information and we believe are necessary to clarify and ensure effective implementation of the by-pass provisions in the Act.  We are making one change to Sec. 300.191(d) to clarify that the Secretary deducts amounts the Secretary determines necessary to implement a by-pass from the State's allocations under sections 611 and 619 of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  In Sec. 300.191(d) we have substituted a reference to sections 611 and 619 of the Act for a reference to Part B of the Act. </p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">
Show cause hearing (Sec. 300.194)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1553%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter opposed allowing a lawyer for the SEA or LEA to present oral and written evidence and arguments at a show cause hearing because parents are often intimidated by having to face a lawyer. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.194(a)(3) provides an opportunity for an SEA, LEA, or other public agency, and representatives of private elementary schools and secondary schools to be represented by legal counsel and to submit oral or written evidence or arguments at a hearing to show cause why a by-pass should not be implemented.  Parents are not parties to this hearing and generally would not appear before the show cause hearing officer, and would, therefore, not be intimidated by a participating lawyer.  We believe that it is only fair that the party to the hearing (SEA, LEA, or other public agency, and representatives of private schools) be provided the option to be represented by legal counsel because legal counsel will generally represent the Department, as a party to the hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

State administration (Sec. 300.199)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CB%2C1557%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter indicated that Sec. 300.199 is improperly placed in the regulations under the general heading "By-pass for Children in Private Schools."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter that Sec. 300.199 does not belong under the general heading "By-Pass for Children in Private Schools."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new undesignated center heading entitled "State Administration" will be added immediately preceding Sec. 300.199 to separate that section from the regulations related to implementation of the by-pass provisions of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended including in Sec. 300.199 a requirement that States may not eliminate from their rules, regulations, and policies any provisions required by Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.199 incorporates the requirement in section 608 of the Act that any rulemaking related to the Act conducted by the State conform to the purposes of the Act.  Consistent with section 608 of the Act, Sec. 300.199 makes clear that each State that receives funds under Part B of the Act must ensure that any State rules, regulations, and policies relating to 34 CFR part 300 conform to the provisions of 34 CFR part 300.  We do not believe it is necessary to add a provision in Sec. 300.199 prohibiting States from eliminating from their rules, regulations, and policies any provisions required by Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations, as requested by the commenter.  If a State were to do so, the State's rules, regulations, and policies would not conform to the provisions in 34 CFR part 300.  Under this provision, a State, and not the Secretary, determines whether a particular rule, regulation, or policy conforms to the purposes of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters expressed concern that the mandate to minimize State rules and regulations might discourage States from developing beneficial programs, and, therefore, should not pertain to policies that promote best practices, increased parental involvement, educating children in the least restrictive environment, and improving access to the general curriculum.  One commenter recommended including a statement in the regulations that a State would not be penalized for exceeding the minimum requirements of the Act.  A few commenters stated that the services provided by the Act were intended to be a "floor," rather than a "ceiling" and recommended a pilot program to encourage States to adopt rules that best serve the needs of children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that the regulations discourage States from developing beneficial programs or establishing rules that best serve the needs of children with disabilities.  In fact, Sec. 300.199(b), consistent with section 608(b) of the Act, requires State rules, regulations, and policies under the Act to support and facilitate LEA and school-level system improvement designed to enable children with disabilities to meet challenging State student academic achievement standards.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.199(a), consistent with section 608(a) of the Act, is intended to minimize the number of rules, regulations, and policies to which LEAs and schools are subject under the Act, and to identify in writing any rule, regulation, or policy that is State-imposed and not required under the Act and its implementing regulations.  The Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 10, which states "Through section 608(a), the committee is in no way attempting to reduce State input or State practice in this area, but intends to make clear what is a Federal obligation and what is a State or local educational agency requirement for the Act."  We believe it is important for parents, teachers, school administrators, State lawmakers, and others to understand what is required under the Act, and, therefore, do not believe that Sec. 300.199 should be changed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
