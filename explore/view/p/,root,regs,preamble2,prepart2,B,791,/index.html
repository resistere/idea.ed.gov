Assistive technology (Sec. 300.105)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended removing Sec. 300.105 and including the requirements in this section in the definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 and assistive technology service in Sec. 300.6. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.5 and Sec. 300.6 define the terms assistive technology device and assistive technology service, respectively.  Section 300.105 is not part of the definition of these terms, but rather is necessary to specify the circumstances under which public agencies are responsible for making available assistive technology devices and assistive technology services to children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested clarifying in Sec. 300.105(b) whether hearing aids are included in the definition of an assistive technology device.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An assistive technology device, as defined in Sec. 300.5, means any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability.  The decision of whether a hearing aid is an assistive technology device is a determination that is made on an individual basis by the child's IEP Team.  However, even if the IEP Team determines that a hearing aid is an assistive technology device, within the meaning of Sec. 300.5, for a particular child, the public agency is responsible for the provision of the assistive technology device as part of FAPE, only if, as specified in Sec. 300.105, the device is required as part of the child's special education defined in Sec. 300.39, related services defined in Sec. 300.34, or supplementary aids and services defined in Sec. 300.42.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As a general matter, public agencies are not responsible for providing personal devices, such as eyeglasses or hearing aids that a child with a disability requires, regardless of whether the child is attending school.  However, if it is not a surgically implanted device and a child's IEP Team determines that the child requires a personal device (e.g., eyeglasses) in order to receive FAPE, the public agency must ensure that the device is provided at no cost to the child's parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language to Sec. 300.105(b) to include, in addition to hearing aids, other hearing enhancement devices, such as a cochlear implant.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.105(b), as proposed, requires a public agency to ensure that hearing aids worn in school by children with hearing impairments, including deafness, are functioning properly.  This is a longstanding requirement and was included pursuant to a House Committee Report on the 1978 appropriations bill (H. Rpt. No. 95-381, p. 67 (1977)) directing the Department to ensure that children with hearing impairments are receiving adequate professional assessment, follow-up, and services.  The Department believes that, given the increase in the number of children with disabilities with surgically implanted devices (e.g., cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulators, electronic muscle stimulators), and rapid advances in new technologies to help children with disabilities, it is important that these regulations clearly address any obligation public agencies have to provide follow-up and services to ensure that such devices are functioning properly.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 602(1) of the Act clarifies that the definition of assistive technology device does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Section 602(26) of the Act also stipulates that only medical services that are for diagnostic and evaluative purposes and required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education are considered a related service.  We believe Congress was clear in its intent in S. Rpt. 108-185, p. 8, which states:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
[T]he definitions of "assistive technology device" and "related services" do not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the post-surgical maintenance, programming, or replacement of such device, or an external device connected with the use of a surgically implanted medical device (other than the costs of performing routine maintenance and monitoring of such external device at the same time the child is receiving other services under the act).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Department believes, however, that public agencies have an obligation to change a battery or routinely check an external component of a surgically implanted medical device to make sure it is turned on and operating.  However, mapping a cochlear implant (or paying the costs associated with mapping) is not routine checking as described above and should not be the responsibility of a public agency.  We will add language to the regulations to clarify a public agency's responsibility regarding the routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new Sec. 300.113 has been added with the heading, "Routine checking of hearing aids and external components of surgically implanted medical devices."  Section 300.105(b), regarding the proper functioning of hearing aids, has been removed and redesignated as new Sec. 300.113(a).  We have added a new paragraph (b) in new Sec. 300.113 clarifying that, for a child with a surgically implanted medical device who is receiving special education and related services under this part, a public agency is responsible for routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices, but is not responsible for the post-surgical maintenance, programming, or replacement of a medical device that has been surgically implanted (or of an external component of a surgically implanted medical device).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The provisions in Sec. 300.105 have been changed to conform with the other changes to this section and the phrase "proper functioning of hearing aids" has been removed from the heading.  </p></p>
