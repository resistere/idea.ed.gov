Opportunity to examine records; parent participation in meetings (Sec. 300.501)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language in Sec. 300.501(a) stating that parents have the right to obtain a free copy of all education records.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.501(a), consistent with section 615(b)(1) of the Act, affords parents an opportunity to inspect and review all education records with respect to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child, and the provision of FAPE to the child.  Specific procedures for access to records are contained in the confidentiality provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.613 through 300.621.  A participating agency, consistent with Sec. 300.613(b)(2), however, must provide copies of a child's education records to a parent, if failure to do so would effectively prevent a parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the records, such as if a parent lives outside of commuting distance of the agency.  This provision is consistent with the access rights afforded under FERPA in 34 CFR 99.10(d)(1).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We decline to make the change requested by the commenter because such a change would impose a significant new burden on public agencies that is not necessary.  Public agencies, however, are free to provide copies whenever requested by the parent, if they choose to do so.  We have, however, made a change to this section to correct the cross-references to the procedures for inspection and review of records.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have corrected the cross-references to the procedures for inspection and review of records to Sec. Sec. 300.613 through 300.621. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding a provision to Sec. 300.501 that would give parents the opportunity to prepare their own reports and provide information that would become part of the child's education record.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters suggested adding language in Sec. 300.501(b)(2) requiring the public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that parents understand the proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  The commenters stated that this requirement is not unnecessarily duplicative and removing it gives the impression that interpreters are no longer required.  Several commenters recommended that if school staff determines that a parent has difficulty understanding the procedural safeguards, the public agency must explain the parent's rights at any time that a change in services is contemplated.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language to Sec. 300.501(b)(2) to require a public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that parents understand the proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  Public agencies are required by other Federal statutes to take appropriate actions to ensure that parents who themselves have disabilities and limited English proficient parents understand proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  The other Federal statutory provisions that apply in this regard are Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 104 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance), title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations in 28 CFR part 35 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, regardless of receipt of Federal funds), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 100 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of Federal financial assistance).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section to subpart D, we have retained the requirements in current Sec. 300.345(e), which require the public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the parent understands the proceedings at an IEP Team meeting, including arranging for an interpreter for parents with deafness or whose native language is other than English.  This requirement is in new Sec. 300.322(e).  We have also included a cross reference to new Sec. 300.322(e) in Sec. 300.501(c)(2) to clarify that. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.  Section 300.503 already requires prior written notice to be given to the parents of a child with a disability a reasonable time before the public agency proposes (or refuses) to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.503(c) and 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and provided in the native language or other mode of communication of the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the public agency must take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.501(b)(3) implies that teaching methodologies and lesson plans must be included in the IEP, which exceeds the requirements of the Act.  The commenters recommended removing "if those issues are not addressed in the child's IEP" from Sec. 300.501(b)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the phrase referred to by the commenters is confusing and open to misinterpretation and are removing it from Sec. 300.501(b)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "if those issues are not addressed in the child's IEP" from Sec. 300.501(b)(3) for clarity.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended requiring a public agency to make several attempts to involve parents in placement decisions and requested that Sec. 300.501 be changed to require a public agency to maintain:  (1) detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; (2) copies of correspondence sent to parents and any responses received; and (3) detailed records of visits made to a parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the additional language requested by the commenters is necessary.  Section 300.501(c)(4) requires a public agency to maintain a record of its attempts to contact parents prior to making a placement decision without parent participation.  We believe this requirement is sufficient to ensure that a public agency holding a placement meeting with neither parent in attendance takes the necessary steps to contact parents and maintain appropriate documentation of its attempts to ensure parent participation.  As a matter of practice, public agencies use a variety of methods to contact parents depending on the ways they find to be most efficient and effective for a particular situation.  Public agencies take seriously their obligation to include parents in placement decisions and are in the best position to determine the records they need to demonstrate that they have taken appropriate steps to include parents in placement decisions before holding a placement meeting without a parent in attendance.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that placement meetings not be held, or decisions made, without a representative of the child.  The commenters recommended appointing a surrogate parent when the biological or adoptive parent refuses to attend, or is unable to participate, in the placement meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is no statutory authority to permit the appointment of a surrogate parent when a parent is either unable or unwilling to attend a meeting in which a decision is made relating to a child's educational placement.  In section 615(b)(2) of the Act, a public agency does not have the authority to appoint a surrogate parent where a child's parent is available or can be identified and located after reasonable efforts, but refuses, or is unable, to attend a meeting or otherwise represent the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
