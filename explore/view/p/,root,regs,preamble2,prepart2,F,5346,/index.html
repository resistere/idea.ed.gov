Notifying the Public of Enforcement Actions (Sec.  300.606)
<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(originally published on December 1, 2008 &#8211; 73 FR 73006; effective date &#8211; December 31, 2008)
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter requested that the Department require SEAs 
to report to the public any enforcement actions taken against their 
LEAs pursuant to Sec.  300.604 because doing so would be consistent 
with publication of enforcement actions against the State by the 
Secretary of Education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Neither the Act nor these regulations require SEAs to 
publicly report on enforcement actions taken against LEAs in the State. 
The decision to report to the public on enforcement actions imposed on 
an LEA is best left to each State to decide because individual LEA 
circumstances vary across each State and no one set of requirements is 
appropriate in every situation. For example, publicly reporting 
enforcement actions taken against an LEA with limited numbers of 
children with disabilities would not be appropriate if that public 
reporting would in any way reveal personally identifiable information 
of children with disabilities in that LEA. However, in the interest of 
transparency and public accountability, the Department encourages 
States, where appropriate, to report to the public on any enforcement 
actions taken against LEAs under Sec.  300.604.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter stated that increasing public accountability 
is important and requested that the regulations require States and 
districts to publicly post and make available to the public the 
Department's SPP/APR determination letters as well as Federal-or State-
required corrective actions and enforcement actions.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We encourage States to post all information, including 
corrective actions and enforcement actions related to their SPP/APR, on 
their Web sites. However, regulating on this issue, as the commenter 
requested, is not necessary because this information is posted on the 
Department's Web site when the Department responds to States' SPP/APR 
submission. These response letters are typically issued in June of each 
year following the States' submission of their SPP/APR and posted on 
the Department's Web site at: http://www.ed.gov/fund/data/report/idea/
partbspap/index.html.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter requested that the phrase ``proposing to 
take'' in proposed Sec.  300.606 be clarified or eliminated. The 
commenter recommended using the language from page 27694 of the NPRM 
stating that a State must provide public notice when the Secretary 
``takes'' an enforcement action as a result of annual determinations 
under Sec.  300.604.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The language in Sec.  300.606 is accurate and we 
decline to make the requested change for the following reasons. Section 
300.606 implements section 616(e)(7) of the Act, and requires a State 
that has received notice, under section 616(d)(2) of the Act, of a 
pending enforcement action against the State under section 616(e) of 
the Act to provide public notice of the pendency of that action. 
Pursuant to section 616(d)(2)(B) of the Act, a State that has been 
determined to ``need intervention'' for three consecutive years or 
``need substantial intervention'' in implementing the requirements of 
Part B of the Act, faces enforcement actions and is entitled to 
reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing on such a 
determination. If a State requests a hearing on a determination, the 
Department's final determination would not be made until after that 
hearing. In this situation, the enforcement action also would depend on 
the outcome of the hearing and final determination. Therefore, in a 
case such as this, the public must be notified that the Secretary is 
proposing to take, but has not yet taken, an enforcement action 
pursuant to Sec.  300.604.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter stated that the changes in proposed Sec.  
300.606 are unnecessary because current Sec.  300.606 already requires 
the public to be notified of an action ``taken pursuant to Sec.  
300.604.'' The commenter stated that specifying in these regulations 
that ``public notice'' consists of posting information on a Web site 
and distributing information to the media and public agencies is 
unnecessary to ensure compliance with IDEA.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree with the commenter. We have received 
numerous inquiries regarding current Sec.  300.606 and whether this 
provision requires public notification of each determination of ``needs 
assistance'', ``needs intervention'' and ``needs substantial 
intervention'' or whether it merely requires States to notify the 
public of enforcement actions taken by the Secretary. We intend for 
Sec.  300.606, as proposed in the NPRM, to clarify the public reporting 
requirements by indicating that a State must provide public notice of 
any enforcement action taken by the Secretary pursuant to Sec.  300.604 
by posting the notice on the SEA's Web site and distributing the notice 
to the media and through public agencies. This clarification is further 
designed to minimize a State's reporting burden while providing the 
public with appropriate notice of the actions taken by the Secretary as 
a result of the determinations required by section 616(d) of the Act 
and Sec.  300.603. For these reasons, we decline to make any regulatory 
changes based on this comment.
