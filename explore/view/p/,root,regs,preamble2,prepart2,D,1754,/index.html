Parental consent for services (Sec. 300.300(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the Department address situations in which a child is receiving special education services and a parent wants to withdraw consent or refuse services because the parent believes the child no longer needs special education services.  A few commenters stated that public agencies should not be allowed to use the procedural safeguards to continue to provide special education and related services to a child whose parents withdraw consent for the continued provision of special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are considering the question of whether parents who previously consented to the initiation of special education services should have the right to subsequently remove their child from special education services.  We anticipate publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future seeking public comment on this issue.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended changing the regulations to allow the public agency to provide services in anticipation of receiving parental consent when the public agency initiates a due process hearing to obtain parental consent for initial services. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  To implement the change requested by the commenter would be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act requires a public agency to obtain informed parental consent before providing initial special education and related services to a child.  In addition, a public agency may not initiate a due process hearing to provide special education and related services to a child when a parent refuses to consent to initial services, consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act.  A child whose parent has refused consent for initial services would not be provided special education and related services and would continue to receive general education services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify the meaning of "initial provision of services" as used in Sec. 300.300(b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.300(b) is clear that the "initial provision of services" means the first time a parent is offered special education and related services after the child has been evaluated in accordance with the procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, and has been determined to be a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations permit mediation when a parent of a child refuses to consent to the provision of special education and related services.  A few commenters recommended revising the regulations to require a public agency to use the due process procedures, or other alternative dispute resolution procedures, if a parent refuses to consent to initial services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act, is clear that if a parent fails to respond or refuses to consent to initial services, the public agency may not use the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516 in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to a child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that additional documentation is necessary if a parent does not provide consent for initial services and suggested adding language to the regulations to require public agencies to document the steps they have taken to obtain parental consent for initial services and to maintain them in the child's permanent file.  Another commenter recommended requiring that the parent's refusal to consent for initial services occur during a properly convened IEP Team meeting.  The commenter also suggested requiring that the documentation of a parent's refusal to provide consent include evidence that all options waived by the parent have been explained, that the parent has refused services, and the reasons for the parent's refusal.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related services to the child and will make this clear in Sec. 300.300(b).  We noted in our discussion regarding the reasonable efforts that a public agency must make to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, that we added a new paragraph (d)(5) to Sec. 300.300 that provides that to meet the reasonable efforts requirement, a public agency must document its attempts to obtain consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).  We believe a public agency should make these same reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent for initial services, and will include this in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require a public agency to maintain additional documentation, beyond that required in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5), of a parent's refusal to provide consent for initial services or to prescribe where this documentation must be obtained or maintained.  Public agencies understand the importance of properly documenting a parent's refusal to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services and are in the best position to determine any additional documentation that is necessary and where to obtain and maintain such documentation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(2) to Sec. 300.300 to clarify that the public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.  Subsequent paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly.  We also have included a reference to new Sec. 300.300(b)(2) in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5) that requires a public agency to document its attempts to obtain consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language to clarify that if a parent does not consent to initial services, the child would be considered a part of the general education enrollment and subject to the same disciplinary provisions as nondisabled children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The language requested by the commenter is not necessary because section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act already provides for situations in which a parent refuses consent for initial services and the child subsequently engages in behavior that violates a code of student conduct.  Section 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, or has refused services under this part.  Therefore, such a child would not be able to assert any of the protections provided to children with disabilities under the Act, and would be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as any other child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring a public agency to refer parents who do not provide consent for initial services to the State's PTI center so that the parents can be advised of the benefits of special education and their rights and responsibilities under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it would be appropriate to require a public agency to refer parents to a particular agency or program.  Such matters are best left to States and LEAs to decide and should not be included in the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require a public agency to report a parent for suspected child abuse or neglect to the appropriate agency if the public agency believes that the parent's failure or refusal to consent to initial services meets the definition of child abuse or neglect under the State's mandatory reporting law.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to include the requirement recommended by the commenter in these regulations, as the issue would already be addressed by State law, if under State law a parent's failure to consent to initial services under the Act was considered child abuse or neglect.  Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern about new Sec. 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)), which provides that if a parent fails to consent for initial services or refuses to respond to a request for consent, the public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for the child.  A few commenters stated that this should be permitted only when a parent refuses services, but not when a parent fails to respond to a request for consent for initial services.  A few commenters stated that the regulations should be revised to clarify that this applies only to subsequent IEP Team meetings, not the initial IEP Team meeting.  One commenter recommended revising the regulations to require an IEP Team meeting to be held and an IEP developed to provide a basis for informed consent. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)) follows the specific language in section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(III)(bb) of the Act and reflects the new provision in the Act that relieves public agencies of any potential liability for failure to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for a child whose parents have refused consent or failed to respond to a request for consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.  It does not, however, prevent a public agency from convening an IEP Team meeting and developing an IEP for a child as a means of informing the parent about the services that would be provided with the parent's consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters questioned how a parent could be adequately informed of the services the parent is refusing if the public agency is not required to develop an IEP when the parent refuses to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We understand the commenters' concern that a parent of a child with a disability who refuses to consent to the provision of special education and related services may not fully understand the extent of the special education and related services their child would receive without the development of an IEP for their child.  However, we do not view the consent provisions of the Act as creating the right of parents to consent to each specific special education and related service that their child receives.  Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.  "Fully informed," in this context, means that a parent has been given an explanation of what special education and related services are and the types of services that might be found to be needed for their child, rather than the exact program of services that would be included in an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the regulations should include sanctions for parents who repeatedly fail to respond to requests for consent from public agencies, such as paying the costs incurred by agencies attempting to obtain consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not authorize sanctions against parents who fail to respond to requests for consent.  Changes:  None.</p></p>
