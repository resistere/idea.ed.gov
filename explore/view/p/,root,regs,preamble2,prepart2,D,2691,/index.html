IEP or IFSP for children aged three through five (Sec. 300.323(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising the regulations to clarify when an IEP must be in place for a child transitioning from an early intervention program under Part C of the Act to a preschool special education program under Part B of the Act whose third birthday occurs after the start of the school year.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter's concern is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.101(b), consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act, requires an IEP to be in effect no later than the child's third birthday.  However, Sec. 300.323(b)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(B) of the Act, provides that a State, at its discretion, may provide special education and related services to two-year-old children with disabilities who will turn three during the school year.  In such cases, the State must ensure that an IEP is developed and in effect at the start of the school year in which the child turns three.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that an IFSP that was incorrectly developed by the early intervention agency should not be the school district's responsibility to correct.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The development of an IFSP for children from birth through age two is the responsibility of the designated lead agency responsible for early intervention programs under section 635(a)(10) in Part C of the Act.  When a child turns age three, section 612(a)(9) of the Act requires each State to ensure that an IEP has been developed and implemented.  However, if a child turns age three and an LEA and a parent agree to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, as allowed under section 614(d)(2)(B) of the Act, the LEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b) are met.  Therefore, if an IFSP was incorrectly developed by the early intervention agency and the public agency and the parent agree to use the IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the LEA is responsible for modifying the IFSP so that it meets the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.323(b), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(B) of the Act, allows an IFSP to serve as an IEP for a child with a disability aged three through five (or at the discretion of the SEA, a two-year old child with a disability, who will turn age three during the school year), under the following conditions:  (a) using the IFSP as the IEP is consistent with State policy and agreed to by the agency and the child's parents; (b) the child's parents are provided with a detailed explanation of the differences between an IFSP and an IEP; (c) written informed consent is obtained from the parent if the parent chooses an IFSP; (d) the IFSP contains the IFSP content, including the natural environments statement; (e) the IFSP includes an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills for children with IFSPs who are at least three years of age; and (f) the IFSP is developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under Part B of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require the IEP Team to explain the changes in services and settings in the initial IEP Team meeting for a child transitioning from an early intervention program under Part C of the Act to a preschool program under Part B of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenter.  Section 300.124, consistent with section 612(a)(9) of the Act, already requires States to have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that children transitioning from an early intervention program under Part C of the Act to a preschool program under Part B of the Act experience a smooth and effective transition to those preschool programs.  In addition, each LEA is required to participate in transition planning conferences with the lead agency responsible for providing early intervention services and to have an IEP (or an IFSP, if consistent with Sec. 300.323(b) and section 636(d) of the Act) for the child developed and implemented by the child's third birthday.  We believe that in the course of the transition planning conferences and developing the child's IEP, there would be many opportunities for discussions regarding the services provided under Parts B and C of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that there is no statutory basis to require detailed explanations of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP or for written informed parental consent when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is important to retain these requirements in Sec. 300.323(b)(2) because of the importance of the IEP as the statutory vehicle for ensuring FAPE to a child with a disability.  Although the Act does not specifically require a public agency to provide detailed explanations to the parent of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP, we believe parents need this information to make an informed choice regarding whether to continue to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP.  Parents, for example, should understand that it is through the IEP that the child is entitled to the special education and related services that the child's IEP Team determines are necessary to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and to receive FAPE.  If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.  For a parent to waive the right to an IEP, informed parental consent is necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations explicitly state that the IFSP does not have to include all the elements of an IEP when the IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.323(b)(1) provides that, in order for the IFSP to be used as the IEP, the IFSP must contain the IFSP content (including the natural environments statement) in section 636(d) of the Act and be developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under Part B of the Act.  For children who are at least three years of age, the IFSP must also include an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills.  There is no requirement for the IFSP to include all the required elements in an IEP.  We think this point is clear in the regulations and that no further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended changing Sec. 300.323(b)(2)(i) to require parental consent before a preschool-aged child receives an IFSP in States that have a policy under section 635(c) of the Act.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether States have flexibility to continue early intervention services until the end of the school year in which a child turns three.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.323(b) outlines the specific requirements that apply when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP for children aged three through five, as a means of providing FAPE for the child under Part B of the Act.  This is not the same as the policy in section 635(c) of the Act, which gives States the flexibility to provide early intervention services under Part C of the Act to three year old children with disabilities until they enter into, or are eligible under State law to enter into, kindergarten.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Under Sec. 300.323(b), when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP, the child continues to receive FAPE.  This would not be the case under section 635(c) of the Act.  Under section 635(c) of the Act, parents of children with disabilities who are eligible for preschool services under section 619 of the Act and previously received early intervention services under Part C of the Act, may choose to continue early intervention services until the child enters, or is eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten.  The option to continue early intervention services is available only in States where the lead agency under Part C of the Act and the SEA have developed and implemented a State policy to provide this option.  This option will be detailed in the Part C regulations, and not the Part B regulations, as it permits a continuation of eligibility and coverage under Part C of the Act, rather than FAPE under Part B of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Parental consent is required under Sec. 300.323(b), when the IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP, and under section 635(c) of the Act, when a parent opts to continue early intervention services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
