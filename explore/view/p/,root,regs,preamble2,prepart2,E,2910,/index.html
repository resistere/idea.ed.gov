Independent educational evaluation (Sec. 300.502)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language to Sec. 300.502 requiring evaluators who conduct independent educational evaluations (IEEs) to be licensed by the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations in the manner requested by the commenter because the regulations already require that the standards be the same for all evaluators, as long as the agency's criteria for evaluators do not prohibit a parent from obtaining an IEE.  An IEE is defined in Sec. 300.502(a)(3)(i) as an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency responsible for the education of the child in question.  Section 300.502(e) provides that in order for an IEE to be at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with the parent's right to an IEE.  Except for these criteria, Sec. 300.502(e)(2) provides that a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense.  Consistent with applicable agency criteria, it would be appropriate for a public agency to require an IEE examiner to hold, or be eligible to hold, a particular license when a public agency requires the same licensure for personnel who conduct the same types of evaluations for the agency.  In contrast, it would be inconsistent with a parent's right to an IEE for a public agency to require all evaluators to be licensed, if only individuals employed by a public agency may obtain a license.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding parental rights to an IEE when a public agency is using a response to intervention process to determine whether a child has SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a parent disagrees with the results of a completed evaluation that includes a review of the results of a child's response to intervention process, the parent has a right to an IEE at public expense, subject to the conditions in Sec. 300.502(b)(2) through (b)(4).  The parent, however, would not have the right to obtain an IEE at public expense before the public agency completes its evaluation simply because the parent disagrees with the public agency's decision to use data from a child's response to intervention as part of its evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding a public agency's right to limit the amount it pays for an IEE and asked whether a public agency can place limits on the frequency of an IEE (e.g., a single IEE in an evaluation cycle or in a child's school career).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is the Department's longstanding position that public agencies should not be required to bear the cost of unreasonably expensive IEEs.  This position is reflected in the regulatory provisions.  Section 300.502(a)(2) provides that if a parent requests an IEE at public expense, the public agency must provide the parent with information about where an IEE may be obtained and the agency criteria applicable for IEEs.  In order for an evaluation to be at public expense, Sec. 300.502(e)(1) requires that the criteria under which an IEE is obtained, including the location of the IEE and the qualifications of the examiner, be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent that those criteria are consistent with a parent's right to an IEE.  In addition, Sec. 300.502(e)(2) states that, except for the criteria described above, a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Although it is appropriate for a public agency to establish reasonable cost containment criteria applicable to personnel used by the agency, as well as to personnel used by parents, a public agency would need to provide a parent the opportunity to demonstrate that unique circumstances justify selection of an evaluator whose fees fall outside the agency's cost containment criteria.  Section 300.502(b)(2) provides that if the parent requests an IEE at public expense, the public agency either must ensure that the IEE is provided at public expense or file a due process complaint notice to request a hearing to demonstrate that the agency's evaluation is appropriate.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not, however, believe that the parent should be limited to one IEE at public expense in a child's school career.  In the school career of a child, there could be more than one point when there is a legitimate disagreement between a parent and the public agency over evaluations of the child.  Nevertheless, we do believe that it is important to clarify that a parent is not entitled to more than one IEE at public expense when the parent disagrees with a specific evaluation or reevaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(5) in Sec. 300.502 to clarify that a parent is entitled to only one IEE each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.  This regulatory provision is consistent with a parent's statutory right to an IEE at public expense, while recognizing that public agencies should not be required to bear the cost of more than one IEE when a parent disagrees with an evaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(5) in Sec. 300.502 to clarify that a parent is entitled to only one IEE at public expense each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters suggested adding language allowing an evaluator conducting an IEE the opportunity to review existing data, receive input from the child's parents, determine what additional data are needed to determine the scope of the evaluation, and select the instruments appropriate to evaluate the child.  The commenters also stated that the public agency should not restrict the scope of the evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to add language to the regulations regarding the review of existing data, input from the child's parents, the scope of the evaluation, or the instruments used to evaluate the child, because an IEE must meet the agency criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, consistent with Sec. 300.502(e).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.305(a) provides that, as part of an initial evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this part, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, must review existing evaluation data on the child, including input from the child's parents.  Since the review of existing evaluation data and input from the child's parents are part of the public agency's evaluation, they would also be appropriate elements in an IEE.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Similarly, Sec. 300.304(b)(1) provides that an evaluation conducted by a public agency must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about the child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8, and the content of the child's IEP, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child to participate in appropriate activities).  These requirements also apply to an IEE conducted by an independent evaluator, since these requirements will be a part of the agency's criteria.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Generally, the purpose of an evaluation under the Act is to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, and in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to have a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  It would be inconsistent with the Act for a public agency to limit the scope of an IEE in a way that would prevent an independent evaluator from fulfilling these purposes.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended adding language to the regulations requiring a parent to provide consent for release of education records when a hearing officer orders an LEA to provide an IEE at public expense.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consistent with Sec. 300.622(b), parental consent is not required for a public agency to release education records to a hearing officer because a hearing officer is an official of a participating agency, as defined in Sec. 300.611(c).  However, when a hearing officer orders an IEE, parental consent would be required under Sec. 300.622(a) for a public agency to release education records to the independent evaluator who will conduct the IEE, since in these situations, the independent evaluator is not an official of a participating agency.  If a parent refuses to consent to the release of education records to an independent evaluator, a hearing officer could decide to dismiss the complaint.  Therefore, we are not changing the regulations in the manner suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested clarification regarding what an LEA must do to satisfy the requirement in Sec. 300.502(c)(1) that a public agency consider the results of an evaluation obtained by a parent at private expense.  The commenters stated that public agencies often ignore the results of an IEE and recommended requiring public agencies to explain why an IEE was rejected.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.502(c)(1) imposes an affirmative obligation on a public agency to consider the results of a parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in any decision regarding the provision of FAPE to the child, if that evaluation meets agency criteria.  The requirement, however, does not mean that the public agency is compelled to consider the parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in its decision regarding the provision of FAPE, if it does not meet agency criteria.  If the agency believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria, it would be appropriate for the agency to explain to the parent why it believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters indicated that permitting any party to use the results from a privately-funded IEE as evidence at a due process hearing may discourage parents from initiating and paying for evaluations of their child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a parent obtains an evaluation at private expense, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires a parent to share that evaluation with the public agency.  A privately-funded evaluation that is not shared with a public agency would not be considered an IEE under this regulation.  If, however, the parent chooses to share the evaluation with the public agency, that evaluation may be presented by any party as evidence in a due process hearing, in accordance with Sec. 300.502(c)(2).  Similarly, if a public agency reimburses a parent for an IEE, and the parent disagrees with the results of the IEE, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from introducing that evaluation in a due process hearing over the parent's objection.  We disagree with the commenters to the extent that they believe that parents should have an expectation of privacy regarding an evaluation that is publicly-funded or for which they seek public funding.  We believe it is necessary to change Sec. 300.502(c)(2) to ensure that public agencies have the opportunity to introduce the results of publicly-funded IEEs at due process hearings. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.502(c) to permit any party to present the results of a publicly-funded IEE.  We have also clarified that if a parent shares a privately-funded IEE with the public agency, the privately-funded IEE may be used as evidence in a due process hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations prohibit the testimony of experts who did not evaluate the child before the due process hearing, unless the other party has an equal opportunity to evaluate the child at public expense, both parties consent to such testimony, or the hearing officer or judge orders the evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to regulate in the manner recommended by the commenter.  Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis in light of the specific facts of each case at the discretion of the hearing officer.  We believe that the hearing officer, as the designated trier of fact under the Act, is in the best position to determine whether expert testimony should be admitted and what weight, if any, should be accorded that expert testimony.  We would expect that these decisions will be governed by commonly applied State evidentiary standards, such as whether the testimony is relevant, reliable, and based on sufficient facts and data.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
