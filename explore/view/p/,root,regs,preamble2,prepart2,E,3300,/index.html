Attorneys' fees (Sec. 300.517)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  We received a number of comments seeking clarification of, or modifications to, the statutory language governing the award of attorneys' fees.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the SEA or LEA to affirmatively prove that the parent's intent was improper in order to be awarded attorneys' fees under this provision.  A few commenters recommended modifying the regulations to expressly require a determination by a court that the complaint or cause of action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, before an award of attorneys' fees can be considered.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that section 615(i)(3)(B)(i) of the Act seeks to codify the standards set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), and that the principles set forth in this action (that attorneys' fees may only be awarded to defendants in actions where the plaintiffs' claims are frivolous, without foundation, or brought in bad faith) should apply in favor of school districts and parents, since either party can bring complaints. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) be revised to refer to an attorney of a parent or a parent because there are many parents who are attorneys representing their children in due process hearings.  Another commenter recommended including language that the parent must be the prevailing party on substantive grounds in order to claim an award of attorneys' fees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.517(a) incorporates the language in section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act.  Further guidance on the interpretation of this statutory language is not appropriate since judicial interpretations of statutory provisions will necessarily vary based upon case-by-case factual determinations, consistent with the requirement that the award of reasonable attorneys' fees is left to a court's discretion.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the recommendation that we include language that the parent must be the prevailing party on substantive grounds, we decline to regulate because we believe that the statutory provisions regarding attorneys' fees are appropriately described in Sec. 300.517.  Furthermore, section 615(f)(3)(E) of the Act, reflected in Sec. 300.513, recognizes both that hearing officer determinations that a child did not receive FAPE, in some circumstances, may be based on procedural violations, and that hearing officers may order LEAs to comply with procedural requirements.  Either of these circumstances, in appropriate cases, might result in a parent being determined to be a prevailing party for purposes of claiming attorneys' fees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We decline to add language to Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(ii) to refer to a parent who is an attorney, because the reference to "an attorney of a parent" would include anyone serving as an attorney.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(iii), regarding attorneys' fees, be changed to include non-attorney advocates who are acting on behalf of parents and provide that these individuals be held to the same standard as attorneys.  Another commenter expressed concern regarding circuit court rulings that require SEAs to pay for expert witnesses for parents who cannot afford them.  The commenter recommended that the regulations permit SEAs to establish a list of private experts who are willing to testify at due process hearings and to use funds provided under Part B of the Act to pay such experts when either party uses them.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act allows a court to award reasonable attorneys' fees as a part of the costs to a parent who is the prevailing party.  Although the Act also provides parents with the right to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities at a due process hearing, it does not provide for awarding attorneys' fees to these other individuals.  Lay advocates are, by definition, not attorneys and are not entitled to compensation as if they were attorneys.  In addition, consistent with the Supreme Court's recent decision in Arlington Central Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, No. 05-18, U.S., 2006 U.S. LEXIS 5162 (June 26, 2006), if Congress wishes to allow recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents, it must include explicit language authorizing that recovery, which was not done in the Act.  This would apply whether the expert was seeking payment for testifying or advocating. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that attorneys' fees should be available for resolution meetings because parents are required to attend these meetings before a due process hearing can begin.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that the prohibition on attorneys' fees for resolution activities applies to the resolution meeting, as well as any resolution agreement.  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that attorneys' fees for resolution meetings will not be paid until a compromise is reached, and will be based on the resolution meeting itself and not the work that the attorney puts into preparing for the resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.517(c)(2)(iii) of the regulations, consistent with section 615(i)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act, specifies that the resolution meeting is not considered to be a meeting convened as a result of an administrative hearing or judicial action or an administrative hearing or judicial action for purposes of the attorneys' fees provision.  Accordingly, such fees may not be awarded for resolution meetings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
While it is clear that attorneys' fees may not be awarded for resolution meetings, the Act is silent as to whether attorneys' fees are available for activities that occur outside the resolution meeting conducted pursuant to section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act and Sec. 300.510(a).  We decline to regulate on this issue because we believe these determinations will be fact-specific and should be left to the discretion of the court.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters asked whether attorneys' fees can be awarded for attending an IEP Team meeting that is convened as a result of a mediation session conducted prior to the filing of a due process complaint or for attending an IEP Team meeting that is convened as a result of a mediation session conducted at any time.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(i)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act permits States to determine whether attorneys' fees may be awarded for an IEP Team meeting that results from a mediation session described in Sec. 300.506.  Section 300.517(c)(2)(ii), as proposed, inadvertently, limited States to considering awarding attorneys' fees for an IEP Team meeting conducted as the result of a mediation arising prior to the filing of a due process request.  This was an error and has been corrected to allow States the discretion to award attorneys' fees for a meeting of the IEP Team conducted as a result of any mediation described in Sec. 300.506.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  In order to be consistent with section 615(i)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act, we have revised Sec. 300.517(c)(2)(ii) by placing a period after the reference to Sec. 300.506 and removing the rest of the sentence.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that attorneys' fees should also apply to due process complaints brought by private schools or agencies, not just families.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.507(a)(1) permits a parent or a public agency to file a due process complaint under the Act.  Private schools or agencies are not permitted to file a due process complaint under the Act.  Under section 615(f)(1)(A) of the Act, only the parents and public agency are authorized to request a due process hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify in Sec. 300.517(c)(3) what standard will be used to determine whether a parent was substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to include a standard for determining whether a parent is substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer because such matters will depend on the specific facts and circumstances in each case.  The hearing officer, as the designated trier of fact under the Act, is in the best position to determine whether a parent was substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer.  We would expect that a hearing officer's decision will be governed by commonly applied State evidentiary standards, such as whether the testimony is relevant, reliable, and based on sufficient facts and data.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
