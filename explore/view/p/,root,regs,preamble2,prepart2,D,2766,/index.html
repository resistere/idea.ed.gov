Consideration of special factors (Sec. 300.324(a)(2))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended changing Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) to require that the positive behavioral interventions and supports for a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others be based on a functional behavioral assessment.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.324(a)(2)(i) follows the specific language in section 614(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act and focuses on interventions and strategies, not assessments, to address the needs of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is appropriate to include this language in Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) refer specifically to children with internalizing and externalizing behaviors.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to make the recommended change because Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) is written broadly enough to include children with internalizing and externalizing behaviors.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the consideration of special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) is not sufficient to address the behavioral needs of children with disabilities in the IEP process and recommended strengthening the regulations by encouraging school districts to utilize research-based positive behavioral supports and systematic and individual research-based interventions.  One commenter recommended training teachers regarding the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the changes recommended by the commenters need to be made to Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i).  Whether a child needs positive behavioral interventions and supports is an individual determination that is made by each child's IEP Team.  Section 300.321(a)(2)(i) requires the IEP Team, in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others, to consider the use of positive behavioral supports, and other strategies to address that behavior.  We believe that this requirement emphasizes and encourages school personnel to use positive behavioral interventions and supports.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, the regulations reflect the Department's position that high-quality professional development, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, is important to ensure that personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities.  Section 300.207, consistent with section 613(a)(3) of the Act, requires each LEA to ensure that all personnel necessary to carry out Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared, subject to the requirements in Sec. 300.156 and section 2122 of the ESEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, clearly states that each State must establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  Further, section 2122(b)(1)(B) of the ESEA requires an LEA's application to the State for title II funds (Preparing, training, and recruiting high quality teachers and principals) to address how the LEA's activities will be based on a review of scientifically based research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, the implementation of early intervening services in Sec. 300.226 specifically focuses on professional development for teachers and other school staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions, and providing educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports.  We expect that the professional development activities and the services authorized under Sec. 300.226(b)(1) will be derived from scientifically based research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Finally, because the definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion to the new Sec. 300.35.  Under the definition, scientifically based research must be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal or approved by a panel of independent experts through a comparably rigorous, objective, and scientific review.  In short, we believe that the Act and the regulations place a strong emphasis on research based supports and interventions, including positive behavioral interventions and supports.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring positive behavioral interventions and supports for all children identified as having an emotional disturbance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.324(a)(2)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies to address the behavior of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others.  We do not believe there should be a requirement that the IEP Team consider such interventions, supports, and strategies for a particular group of children, or for all children with a particular disability, because such decisions should be made on an individual basis by the child's IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations regarding special factors for the IEP Team to consider in developing IEPs imply that particular methods, strategies, and techniques should be used.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements in Sec. 300.324 are not intended to imply that a particular method, strategy, or technique should be used to develop a child's IEP.  For example, while Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) requires the IEP Team to consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, it does not specify the particular interventions, supports, or strategies that must be used.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the special factors for a child who is blind or visually impaired include a requirement for a clinical low vision evaluation to determine whether the child has the potential to utilize optical devices for near and distance information before providing instruction in Braille and the use of Braille.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act requires instruction in Braille to be provided unless the IEP Team determines that instruction in Braille or in the use of Braille is not appropriate for the child.  However, the Act does not require a clinical low vision evaluation, and we do not believe it would be appropriate to include such a requirement in the regulations.  Whether a clinical low vision evaluation is conducted is a decision that should be made by the child's IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations include language requiring that instruction in Braille be considered at all stages of IEP development, review, and revision.  These commenters also stated that consideration should be given to providing services and supports to improve a child's skills in the areas of socialization, independent living, orientation and mobility, and the use of assistive technology devices.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The issues raised by the commenters are already covered in the regulations.  Section 300.324(a)(2)(iii), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, requires the IEP Team, in the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, to provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille, unless the IEP Team determines (after an evaluation of the child's reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media) that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate.  As noted earlier, a new paragraph (b)(2) has been added to Sec. 300.324 to require the IEP Team to consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when the IEP is reviewed and revised.  This includes considering instruction in Braille and the use of Braille for a child who is blind or visually impaired.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In addition, Sec. 300.324(a)(1)(iv) requires the IEP Team to consider, for all children with disabilities, the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child, which could include, as appropriate, the child's need to develop skills in the areas of socialization, independent living, and orientation and mobility.  Consideration of a child's needs for assistive technology devices and services is required by Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(v).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require IEP Teams, for a child who is deaf, to consider the child's communication abilities, ensure that the child can access language and communicate with peers and adults, and ensure that the child has an educational placement that will meet the child's communication needs.  The commenters also recommended that the IEP Team be required to consider the qualifications of the staff delivering the child's educational program. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concerns are already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.324(a)(2)(iv), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider the child's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With respect to the commenters' recommendation regarding qualified staff to deliver the child's educational program, Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, requires the SEA to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained to serve children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters suggested that Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(iv) explain that:  (a) a primary language assessment and assessment of communication abilities may be required to determine the child's most effective language; (b) program and placement decisions must be based on such assessments; (c) a child must be in an educational placement where the child may communicate with peers and adults; and (d) a deaf child's educational placement must include a sufficient number of peers and adults who can communicate fluently in the child's primary language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to include in the regulations the additional language recommended by the commenters.  Section 300.324(a)(1)(iii), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider, among other things, the results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child, which for a child who is deaf, may include an assessment of a child's communication abilities.  Further, Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(iv), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode.  We believe this adequately addresses the commenters' concerns.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that emotional issues be considered an additional special factor that can impede learning.  The commenter stated that emotional issues can be addressed through individual interventions focused on the child's needs and systemic interventions to improve the overall school climate.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include emotional issues as a special factor to be considered by the IEP Team.  We decline to add it to the regulations because there are already many opportunities for the IEP Team to consider the affect of emotional issues on a child's learning.  For example, Sec. 300.324(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the strengths of the child; the concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child; the results of the initial evaluation or most recent evaluation of the child; and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child, all of which could be affected by emotional issues and would, therefore, need to be considered by the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that children with medical conditions that are degenerative be added to the list of special factors considered by the IEP Team.  The commenters stated that the IEP Team should consider the need for children with degenerative conditions to maintain their present levels of functioning by including related therapeutic services prior to the loss of their abilities, such as occupational and physical therapy, and other services to address the child's needs in the areas of self-help, mobility, and communication.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include consideration of children with degenerative conditions as a special factor.  We decline to add it to the regulations because we believe that the regulations already address the commenters' concerns.  As with any child with a disability, the child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, determines the special education and related services that are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  For children with degenerative diseases, this may include related services such as physical and occupational therapy (or other services to address the child's needs in the areas of self-help, mobility, and communication) to help maintain the child's present levels of functioning for as long as possible in order for the child to benefit from special education.  In addition, as part of an evaluation or reevaluation, Sec. 300.305 requires the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, to review existing evaluation data on the child to determine the child's needs, which may include evaluations and information from parents, as well as medical professionals who know the child and the child's specific medical condition.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 33, and H. Rpt. No. 108-77, p. 112, recognized the special situations of children with medical conditions that are degenerative (i.e., diseases that result in negative progression and cannot be fully corrected or fully stabilized).  For children with degenerative diseases who are eligible for services under the Act, both reports state that special education and related services can be provided to help maintain the child's present levels of functioning for as long as possible in order for the child to fully benefit from special education services.  The reports also state, "The IEP Team can include related services designed to provide therapeutic services prior to loss of original abilities to extend current skills and throughout the child's enrollment in school.  These services may include occupational and physical therapy, self-help, mobility, and communication, as appropriate."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters stated that the IEP Team's review of the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) is duplicative and should be eliminated. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) are directly from section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act and cannot be removed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations retain current Sec. 300.346(b) and require the IEP Team to consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when the IEP is reviewed and revised.  The commenters stated that these special factors may affect a child's instructional needs and ability to obtain FAPE beyond the period when an IEP is initially developed. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department agrees that the IEP Team should consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when an IEP is reviewed and revised.  We will, therefore, add this requirement to the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (b)(2) has been added to Sec. 300.324 to require the IEP Team to consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when the IEP is reviewed and revised.  Proposed Sec. 300.324(b)(2) has been redesignated accordingly.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested changing Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(v), regarding the IEP Team's consideration of a child's need for assistive technology devices and services, to require assistive technology devices and services that are needed for a child to be included in the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child, or on behalf of the child.  This would include any assistive technology devices and services determined by the IEP Team to be needed by the child in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat this in Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(v).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
