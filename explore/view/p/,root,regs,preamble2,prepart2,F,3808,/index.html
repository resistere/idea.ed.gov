Consent (Sec. 300.622) <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested requiring schools to obtain parental consent before disclosing personally identifiable information to any party, unless authorized by 34 CFR part 99.  Another commenter requested clarification regarding the requirements in Sec. 300.622.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that Sec. 300.622 should be revised to more accurately reflect the Department's policies regarding when parental consent is or is not required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to officials of participating agencies, and other individuals and entities.  In some instances, current Sec. 300.571 (proposed Sec. 300.622) has been construed to prohibit disclosures without parental consent under this part that would be permitted without parental consent under FERPA.  Accordingly, when final regulations for this program were issued in 1999, we amended current Sec. 300.571(a) (proposed Sec. 300.622(a)) to clarify that the release of disciplinary records to law enforcement authorities could occur without parental consent, to the extent that such disclosure was permitted under FERPA.  In order to more clearly state the Department's longstanding position that consent is required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to parties, other than officials of participating agencies collecting or using the information under this part, unless the information is contained in education records and the disclosure is allowed without parental consent under 34 CFR part 99, we are reorganizing Sec. 300.622(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Under FERPA and Sec. 300.622(a), schools, generally, must have written permission from the parent (or child who has reached the age of majority) in order to release information from a child's education records.  However, there are exceptions to this general rule under FERPA that also apply to the records of children with disabilities and permit the release of information from education records without parental consent.  Under 34 CFR 99.31(a), schools can disclose education records without consent under the circumstances specified in Sec. 99.31 including if the disclosure meets one or more of the following conditions: </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
School officials with legitimate educational interests, as determined by the educational agency or institution;</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Other schools where the student seeks or intends to enroll, subject to the requirements of Sec. 99.34;</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Specified authorized representatives, subject to the requirements of Sec. 99.35, in connection with an audit or evaluation of Federal or State-supported education programs, or compliance with or enforcement of Federal legal requirements which relate to those programs; </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student for which the student has applied or which the student has received, if necessary for specified purposes;</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Accrediting organizations;</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe that the changes to Sec. 300.622(a) state more clearly that under Sec. 300.622, disclosures of personally identifiable information from education records of children with disabilities can be made without parental consent if the disclosure without parental consent would be permissible under FERPA.  For example, in a situation involving a health emergency, information from a child with a disability's education records could be released to a hospital without parental consent in order to ensure that the child received appropriate emergency health services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Under proposed Sec. 300.622(b), parental consent is not required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to officials of participating agencies for purposes of carrying out a requirement of this part.  This is not a new requirement; proposed Sec. 300.622(b) is the same as current Sec. 300.571(b).  However, we believe the requirement should be stated more clearly, and therefore, are changing the language in paragraph (b).  We believe that this provision is particularly important to ensure that participating agencies have the information they need to carry out the requirements of this part in an effective manner.  For example, if another State agency provides school health services under the Act, consent would not be required for a school nurse to have access to personally identifiable information in a child's education records in order to provide the school health services that are included on the child's IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	However, despite the recognition that officials of participating agencies need access to records of children with disabilities to carry out the requirements of this part, there are important privacy concerns that we feel need to be protected in certain specified situations.  We believe that parental consent should be required before personally identifiable information can be released to representatives of participating agencies who are likely to provide or pay for transition services in accordance with Sec. 300.321(b)(3).  Representatives of these agencies, generally, are invited to participate in a child's IEP meeting because they may be providing or paying for transition services.  We do not believe that the representatives of these agencies should have access to all the child's records unless the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) gives consent for the disclosure.  We are, therefore, adding a new paragraph (b)(2) in Sec. 300.622 to make this clear.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also believe it is important to be clear about the confidentiality requirements for children who are placed in private schools by their parents, given the significant change in the child find requirements for these children.  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, child find for these children now is the responsibility of the LEA in which the private school is located and not the child's LEA of residence.  We can anticipate situations in which there may be requests for information to be exchanged between the two LEAs, such as when a child is evaluated and identified as a child with a disability by the LEA in which the private school is located and the child subsequently returns to public school in the LEA of residence.  We believe under such circumstances parental consent should be required before personally identifiable information is released between officials of the LEA where a private school is located and the LEA of the parent's residence.  We believe that consent is important in these situations to protect the privacy of the child and the child's family.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to make this clear.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are removing the requirement in proposed Sec. 300.622(c) (current Sec. 300.571(c)), which requires the SEA to provide policies and procedures that are used in the event that a parent refuses to provide consent under this section.  This is already included in Sec. 300.504(c)(3), which requires the procedural safeguards notice to include, among other things, a full explanation of the parental consent requirements and the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process or State complaint procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have reorganized Sec. 300.622 to more accurately reflect the Department's policy regarding when parental consent is and is not required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to officials of participating agencies, and other individuals and entities.  We made changes to Sec. 300.622(a) and added a new paragraph (b)(1) to clarify the Department's longstanding policy that consent is required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to parties, unless the interested parties are officials of participating agencies, collecting or using the information under this part, or the information is contained in education records and the disclosure is allowed without parental consent under FERPA.  We added a new paragraph (b)(2) to clarify that parental consent is required for the disclosure of information to participating agencies that likely may provide or pay for transition services.  We also added a new paragraph (b)(3) to require parental consent for the disclosure of records of parentally placed private school children between LEAs.  Finally, we removed the requirement in proposed Sec. 300.622(c) (current Sec. 300.571(c)), because the information is included in Sec. 300.504(c)(3). </p></p>
