Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements of Part B of the Act that were listed in the NPRM under Sec. 300.701(a)(1)(ii)(A)(1) through (5) did not include all of the requirements that apply to freely associated States.  To ensure that freely associated States do not interpret these regulations as including all of the requirements in Part B of the Act that apply to them, we are removing these provisions.  Section 300.701(a)(1)(ii) and (2) clarifies that, consistent with section 611(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, freely associated States must meet the applicable requirements that apply to States under Part B of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed paragraphs (1) through (5) in Sec. 300.701(a)(1)(ii)(A).</p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify whether the technical assistance funds referred to in Sec. 300.702 are available to both SEAs and lead agencies under Part C of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.702, consistent with section 611(c) of the Act, allows the Secretary to reserve funds under Part B of the Act to support technical assistance activities authorized in section 616(i) of the Act.  Under section 642 of the Act, section 616 applies to the early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities under Part C of the Act.  Section 616(i) of the Act requires the Secretary to review the data collection and analysis capacity of States to ensure that data and information necessary for monitoring the implementation of Parts B and C of the Act are collected, analyzed, and accurately reported to the Secretary, and to provide technical assistance, as needed.  Therefore the technical assistance referred to in Sec. 300.702 can be provided to both SEAs and lead agencies under Part C of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department does not have the authority to allocate more funds than Congress appropriates.  Section 300.703, consistent with section 611(d) of the Act, describes how the appropriated funds must be distributed to States.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language in the regulations requiring public agencies to provide technical assistance to personnel in residential treatment facilities.  The commenter stated that this assistance would help residential treatment facilities meet the requirements of FAPE for the children they serve.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.704(a)(1), consistent with section 611(e)(1) of the Act, allows, but does not require, States to use funds reserved for State administration to provide technical assistance to other programs that provide services to children with disabilities, which could include residential treatment facilities providing services to children with disabilities under the Act.  Section 300.704(b)(4)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, allows, but does not require, States to use funds reserved for other State-level activities to provide support and direct services, including technical assistance, personnel preparation, and professional development and training, which could include technical assistance to staff who provide services to children with disabilities at residential treatment centers and other such facilities.  Because the Act gives States the discretion to determine how to use these funds, so long as they are used in accordance with the requirements in Part B of the Act, the Department does not believe it would be appropriate to remove this discretion by regulation and require States to use these funds to provide technical assistance to particular types of facilities, as suggested by the commenter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  We received a number of comments requesting that the regulations require States to use funds reserved for State-level activities for specific purposes.  Some commenters stated that these funds should be used to find and train surrogate parents.  Other commenters requested that these funds be used to support parent centers.  One commenter requested that these funds be used for programs that employ well-researched best practices.  Another commenter suggested that the funds be used for family involvement activities.  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that these funds may be used to purchase supplemental educational materials.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not require States to use their funds reserved for other State-level activities for the purposes requested by the commenters.  The Act also does not prohibit the use of funds for these purposes.  Instead, States have discretion in determining how these funds are used, so long as they are used to carry out the activities in Sec. 300.704(b)(3) and (4).  Therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the term "maximize" in Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v), regarding the use of funds to support the use of technology to maximize accessibility to the general education curriculum, was an "affirmative duty" and, thus, required more detailed instruction.  This commenter also stated that the term "improve" in Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(xi), regarding the use of funds to provide professional development to teachers who teach children with disabilities in order to improve academic achievement, was an "affirmative duty" and, thus, required more detailed instruction. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The language referred to by the commenter is from the Act.  The activities noted by the commenter are authorized under the Act but are not required.  The Department has reviewed Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v) and (b)(4)(xi) and does not believe that additional detail is necessary, because States need the flexibility that the Act provides to appropriately meet the needs within the State. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter agreed with the provision in Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v) that allows States to use funds to support the use of technology to maximize access to the general education curriculum for children with disabilities.  The commenter stated, however, that SEAs and LEAs would be unwilling to research and employ new technologies and asked who would be responsible for conducting this activity.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Supporting the use of technology to maximize accessibility to the general education curriculum is a State-level activity that States are permitted, but not required, to fund.  States have considerable flexibility in determining what State-level activities will be funded, provided the requirements of Part B of the Act are met.  How a State implements a particular activity or program is a matter best left to each State to decide.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v), regarding the use of technology to maximize accessibility to the general education curriculum for children with disabilities, lacked specificity and asked for definitions of the terms "universal design principles," "maximize accessibility to the general curriculum," and "maximum extent."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The definition of universal design, as used in the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as amended, is included in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart A.  We believe this will clarify the meaning of "universal design principles," as used in Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v).  The term "maximize accessibility to the general education curriculum" is sufficiently specific in the context used and does not need further definition.  The term "maximum extent" is not used in Sec. 300.704(b)(4)(v).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Local educational agency high cost fund (Sec. 300.704(c))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CG%2C3893%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the regulations for the high cost fund, particularly the reference to the cost of room and board for a residential placement, would discourage educational placements in the LRE.  The commenter stated that many children with disabilities are sent out of their school districts for special education and related services and asked that the regulations ensure that this practice does not increase. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The language regarding room and board in Sec. 300.704(c)(4)(ii) was included to clarify that the cost of room and board for a necessary residential placement could be supported by the high cost fund.  Section Sec. 300.704(c)(4)(ii) clarifies that the cost of room and board for a residential placement must be determined necessary and be consistent with the LRE requirements in Sec. 300.114.  We believe this is adequate to ensure that educational placements in the LRE are not discouraged.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that reimbursements from a high cost fund would be difficult to compute and requested a template to assist LEAs in their calculations.  Another commenter requested a list of specific procedures that would be excluded from coverage by a high cost fund. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  How States implement the high cost fund is a matter left to the discretion of each State, so long as the State meets the requirements of Part B of the Act.  Accordingly, the Department does not believe it would be appropriate to develop a template, prepared at the Federal level, or a list of specific procedures that would be excluded from coverage.  Whether a particular expenditure is appropriate will vary with the specific facts and circumstances of the situation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether high cost funds could be used for court-ordered placements. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Nothing in the Act or the regulations prohibits payment for providing special education and related services to high need children with disabilities in court-ordered placements, if a State wishes to fund such placements and the other provisions of Part B of the Act are met.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations include plans for continuing programs funded by high cost funds should these funds become unavailable. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The availability of Federal support for a high cost fund, as described in Sec. 300.704(c) and section 611(e)(3) of the Act, is based on a number of factors, including continued Federal appropriations for the Grants to States program and the continued authorization for such a fund under the Act.  Funding of a high cost fund in a particular State is dependent on a State's decision to use a portion of its State-level set-aside for a high cost fund.  This is a matter of State discretion and is not appropriate for regulation at the Federal level.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested an opportunity for public comment before a State implements a high cost fund. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires an SEA to develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a State plan for a high cost fund.  Under Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i)(A), the State plan must, among other components, establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives from LEAs, a definition of a high need child with a disability that meets certain criteria.  This plan must be developed no later than 90 days after the State reserves funds for a high cost fund.  Section 300.704(c)(3)(ii), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, requires a State to make its final State plan for the high cost fund available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year, including dissemination of such information on the State's Web site.  Although there is nothing in the Act that requires that the public be given the opportunity to comment on the State's plan, there also is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a State from providing an opportunity for public comment prior to finalizing the State's plan for the high cost fund.  We believe the decision to provide opportunity for public comment is best left to each State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters asked if LEAs are obligated to participate in the State Medicaid program and whether States could limit the types of reimbursement to LEAs from Medicaid. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  LEAs are not obligated under the Act to participate in a State Medicaid program.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended, controls Medicaid reimbursement for medical assistance for eligible individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to address in these regulations whether States, under the Act, could limit the type of Medicaid reimbursement to LEAs. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked if there was any intent to develop criteria for the development of innovative cost sharing consortia, as stated in Sec. 300.704(c)(1)(i)(B).  The commenter stated that there are no regulations for submitting a State plan for innovative cost-sharing consortia, similar or parallel to the requirements associated with the high cost fund.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter is correct that the proposed regulations would not require the development of a State plan for the high cost fund that includes information or criteria about the development of innovative cost-sharing consortia.  It is important that, if a State elects to reserve funds for supporting innovative and effective ways of cost sharing under Sec. 300.704(c)(1)(i)(B), the State, in its State plan under Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i), include a description of how those funds will be used.  Therefore, a change will be made to make this clear.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (F) has been added to Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i) to clarify that, if a State elects to reserve funds for supporting innovative and effective ways of cost sharing, it must describe in its State plan how these funds will be used.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether State administrative funds could be used for administering the high cost fund. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(2) is clear that a State cannot use any of the funds the State reserves for the high cost fund for costs associated with establishing, supporting, and otherwise administering the fund.  However, a State may use funds reserved for State administration under Sec. 300.704(a) for administering the high cost fund. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations require an SEA to describe in its State plan for the high cost fund the ways in which the SEA will work with State child welfare programs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3) incorporates the language in section 611(e)(3)(C) of the Act, regarding a State plan for the high cost fund.  The Act does not require that the State plan include the ways in which the SEA will work with State child welfare agencies.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from including such information in its plan if it chooses to do so.  We believe that the decision whether to include this information in the State plan for the high cost fund is a matter best left to the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that parents, representatives of the State Advisory Panel, and other stakeholders should participate in developing the definition of a high need child for the purposes of the high cost fund.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i)(A), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, requires the SEA to establish a State definition of a high need child with a disability in consultation with LEAs.  The Act does not require the involvement of parents, representatives of the State Advisory panel, or other stakeholders.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from consulting with these or other groups, if the State chooses to do so.  The Department believes that it would be inappropriate to require SEAs to consult with specific groups, because the appropriate groups for consultation will vary from State to State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment: A few commenters supported the proposed changes to Sec.  
300.705(a) clarifying that States are required to make a subgrant under 
section 611(f) of the Act to eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any 
children with disabilities, because all LEAs have a responsibility to 
identify and provide services to children with disabilities. The 
commenters stated that the Department should ensure that a newly 
created LEA not serving any children with disabilities in the first 
year would still be eligible for some IDEA funds (e.g., based on 
enrollment and the number of students in poverty) to allow the new LEA 
to conduct child find activities and serve any students who are 
identified as eligible for special education services later in the 
year.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Some commenters opposed this provision and recommended that given 
the current level of IDEA Federal funding, funds should be used for 
direct services for students who are currently eligible for special 
education and related services. Additionally, one of these commenters 
expressed concern that Sec.  300.705(a) would require revising current 
State and local funding processes, which would place accounting and 
administrative burdens on both State and local systems. A few 
commenters stated that the proposed change to Sec.  300.705(a) is 
unnecessary because States have been successful in ensuring that small 
school districts receive allocations when they enroll a student with a 
disability. Lastly, one commenter suggested that the proposed changes 
could be handled through administrative guidance, rather than 
regulations.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.705(a), consistent with section 611(f)(1) 
of the Act, requires each State to provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that have 
established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Section 
613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for assistance under 
Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits a plan that 
provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of the 
conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving children with 
disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. Requiring States 
to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will ensure that LEAs have Part B funds 
available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or to 
serve children with disabilities who subsequently enroll or are 
identified during the year. Regardless of the level of funding made 
available for the Part B program under the Act, neither the Act nor the 
implementing regulations require that Part B funds be spent only for 
direct services for students who are currently eligible for special 
education and related services. As in the past, LEAs may use Part B 
funds for direct services to children with disabilities or for other 
permissible activities, such as child find, professional development, 
and more recently, for coordinated early intervening services in 
accordance with Sec.  300.226.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Grants to States and Preschool Grants for Children with 
Disabilities Programs are forward-funded programs and LEAs generally 
receive a subgrant at the beginning of the school year to cover the 
costs of providing special education and related services to children 
with disabilities during the school year. Ensuring that all LEAs, 
including those that have no children with disabilities enrolled at the 
beginning of the school year, have section 611 and section 619 funds 
available will enable LEAs to meet their responsibilities under the Act 
during the school year if a child with a disability subsequently 
enrolls or a child is subsequently identified as having a disability.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We understand the commenter's concern that this change in the 
regulations may require States to revise their procedures for 
distributing Part B funds, and that there may be some administrative 
burden associated with these changes. However, the importance of 
ensuring consistency across States concerning the distribution of 
section 611 and section 619 funds outweighs the potential 
administrative burden. As previously stated in this preamble, making 
these funds available to LEAs is critical to ensure that each LEA is 
able to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act. We agree with 
commenters that some States have been successful in ensuring small LEAs 
receive allocations when they enroll students with disabilities after 
the school year has begun. However, given that the Act and the 
implementing regulations are silent on whether an SEA must make a 
subgrant to an LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, 
clarification is necessary in Sec. Sec.  300.705(a) and 300.815 to 
remove any ambiguity in this regard. Revising the regulations, rather 
than remaining silent on the issue or issuing guidance, will ensure 
that all States treat LEAs in the same manner, including those LEAs 
that are not serving any children with disabilities, when allocating 
Part B funds.

Comment: A few commenters recommended that the proposed regulations 
be modified to give States the option of making subgrants to eligible 
LEAs, including public charter schools that operate as LEAs, when an 
LEA is not currently serving any students with disabilities. The 
commenters stated that States have different needs and some have 
policies in place to help new charter schools meet their child find 
obligations.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We recognize that States are in a unique position to 
assist new LEAs, including charter schools that operate as LEAs. 
However, requiring States to make a subgrant under section 611(f) and 
section 619(g) of the Act to eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any 
children with disabilities, ensures consistency across States and an 
equitable distribution of Part B funds. We also recognize that some 
States may not assign child find responsibility to public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs. However, all LEAs, including public 
charter schools that operate as LEAs, have other responsibilities under 
the IDEA that may need to be carried out during the school year, such 
as serving a child with a disability who is identified during the 
school year. It is the Department's position that it is necessary to 
require States to make (rather than give them the option of making) 
subgrants to eligible LEAs not currently serving any students with 
disabilities, to ensure that all States treat LEAs in the same manner, 
including those LEAs that are not serving any children with 
disabilities, when allocating Part B funds.

Comment: One commenter recommended that the Department withdraw the 
proposed changes and add, if necessary, a new paragraph in Sec. Sec.  
300.705 and 300.815 that would allow a new or expanded charter school 
to receive an allocation under Sec. Sec.  300.705 and 300.815, 
respectively, if the school demonstrates to the SEA that the school is 
serving children with disabilities in accordance with the requirements 
of Part B of the Act within the time frame established by the SEA under 
34 CFR 76.788(b)(2)(i), which provides that once a charter school LEA 
has opened or significantly expanded its enrollment, the charter school 
LEA must provide actual enrollment and eligibility data to the SEA at a 
time the SEA may reasonably require.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We do not agree that the change suggested by the 
commenter is necessary. An eligible public charter school LEA has the 
responsibility to meet the requirements of the Act during the school 
year regardless of whether the LEA is serving children with 
disabilities at the time the subgrant is calculated based on actual 
enrollment and eligibility data. In recognition of these 
responsibilities, requiring an SEA to make an initial subgrant to a new 
or expanded public charter school LEA is appropriate, even if it is not 
serving any children with disabilities at the time actual enrollment 
and eligibility data are provided to the SEA.

Reallocation of LEA Funds (Sec.  300.705(c))

Comment: One commenter supported proposed Sec.  300.705(c). Another 
commenter requested clarification as to the types of activities that 
could be supported with the Part B funds that an LEA does not need to 
provide FAPE, if a State chooses to retain the funds, instead of 
reallocating the funds to other LEAs in the State. One commenter 
recommended that the State be authorized to reallocate the funds 
intended to be allocated to an LEA or retain them for State-level 
activities only after consulting with the LEA to assess the LEA's needs 
and after determining that the LEA does not need the funds.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: A State, under Sec.  300.705(c), may use funds from an 
LEA that does not need the funds for any allowable activities permitted 
under Sec.  300.704, to the extent that the State has not reserved the 
maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level 
activities pursuant to Sec.  300.704(a) and (b). To the extent the 
State has not reserved the maximum amount for administration, the State may use those funds for 
administrative costs consistent with Sec.  300.704(a). To the extent 
the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds available for 
other State-level activities, the State may use those funds for any 
allowable activities permitted under Sec.  300.704(b)(3) and (4) 
including, but not limited to, technical assistance, personnel 
preparation, and assisting LEAs in providing positive behavioral 
interventions and supports. Additionally, if the State has opted to 
finance a high-cost fund under Sec.  300.704(c) and has not reserved 
the maximum amount available for the fund, the State may use those 
funds for the LEA high-cost fund consistent with Sec.  300.704(c).
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In response to the commenter that recommended that the State be 
permitted to reallocate funds only after consulting with the LEA to 
assess the LEA's needs, nothing in these regulations prohibits a State 
from working with an LEA to assess the needs of the LEA before 
determining that the LEA will not be able to use the funds prior to the 
end of the carryover period. However, we believe it would be burdensome 
and unnecessary to require that an SEA consult with an LEA to assess 
the LEA's needs prior to a reallocation of the LEA's remaining 
unobligated funds. The LEA would have already had sufficient time and 
incentive during the carryover period of availability to assess its own 
needs and make appropriate obligations for needed expenditures.

Comment:  A few commenters requested that the Department add a new definition of LEA and SEA for the purposes of regulations related to schools operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  One commenter stated that the regulations would be clearer if these terms were defined for BIA-funded schools, because the definition of state educational agency makes no mention of the BIA.  Another commenter recommended defining LEAs as BIA-funded schools and defining SEA as the Secretary of the Interior for the purposes of regulations related to schools operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the definition of local educational agency in Sec. 300.28, with a specific reference to BIA-funded schools in Sec. 300.28(c), and the definition of State educational agency in Sec. 300.41, along with the requirements in Sec.

Therefore, the Department will consider taking action to clarify the definitions of local educational agency and State educational agency for the purpose of this regulation in the future.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

We are replacing the definition of tribal governing body of a school with the definition of tribal governing body, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2021(19):  Tribal governing body means, with respect to any school, the tribal governing body, or tribal governing bodies, that represent at least 90 percent of the children served by such school.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The Secretary of the Interior must allocate 80 percent of these funds by July 1 of each fiscal year, and the remaining 20 percent by September 30 of each fiscal year.  The Act does not require the Secretary of Education to meet any deadline for providing and distributing funds to the Secretary of the Interior.

Discussion:  The Department agrees that there is a need to clarify that States are responsible for serving Indian children on reservations located in their State who are not attending BIA-funded schools.

Discussion:  The Secretary of the Interior may reserve funds for administration under Sec. 300.710.  Section 300.707(b), consistent with section 611(h)(1)(A) of the Act, requires the Secretary of Education to provide amounts to the Secretary of the Interior to meet the need for assistance for the education of children with disabilities on reservations aged 5 to 21, inclusive, enrolled in elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  The amount of such payment for any fiscal year must be equal to 80 percent of the amount allotted for the Secretary of the Interior under section 611(b)(2) of the Act for that fiscal year. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Since the enactment of regulations implementing P.L. 94-142 in 1977, the regulations have permitted the Secretary of the Interior to use five percent of the funds under Part B of the Act allocated for the education of children with disabilities enrolled in BIA-funded schools for administration.  The Act added the requirement in section 611(h)(1)(A) for 80 percent of the funds to be allocated to BIA-funded schools by July 1 of each fiscal year, and 20 percent of the funds allocated by September 30 of each fiscal year.  Congress' intent in adding this requirement was to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior distributes funds under Part B of the Act quickly and efficiently to BIA-funded schools to ensure that they have the resources they need to provide services to children with disabilities.  (See H. Rpt. 108-77, p. 92.)  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
There is no indication that Congress intended to eliminate the Department's longstanding regulatory provision permitting the Secretary of the Interior to reserve funds for administration, which assist the Office of Indian Education Programs in carrying out its monitoring activities.  Section 611(h)(4)(F) of the Act specifically prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from using any of the 20 percent of the funds under Part B of the Act allocated for coordinating services for preschool children with disabilities for administrative purposes.

Comment:  One commenter supported permitting BIA-funded schools to use funds under Part B of the Act for early intervening services, but stated that not all BIA-funded schools receive funds under Part B of the Act, because the BIA will not provide any such funds until a school uses 15 percent of its Indian School Equalization Program funds (ISEP).

Discussion:  While the Act requires that the Secretary of the Interior allocate funds under Part B of the Act to BIA-funded schools to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities, the Act does not establish requirements for how those funds must be distributed to BIA-funded schools.  The Secretary of the Interior requires that BIA-funded schools use 15 percent of ISEP formula funds for special education services before receiving funds under Part B of the Act.  While the Department understands the concern that not every BIA-funded school will have special education needs sufficient to meet the 15 percent threshold and, therefore, may not receive any funds under Part B of the Act, the Department does not have the authority to permit or encourage BIA-funded schools to use their 15 percent ISEP threshold funds to provide early intervening services or to require the Secretary of the Interior to provide Part B funds to those schools once they have spent 15 percent of their ISEP funds on early intervening services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

In addition, the commenter stated that the term "all Indian children" was too broad, because the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to provide funding only for programs for children who are at least one-fourth Indian blood of a federally recognized tribe; residing on or near a reservation; and enrolled in a BIA-funded school. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

These sections require the Secretary of the Interior to develop and implement a plan for the coordination of services for all Indian children with disabilities residing on reservations covered under Part B of the Act.  In order to clarify the Secretary of the Interior's responsibility under this provision, we are revising Sec. 300.713(a) to clarify that reservations covered under Part B of the Act means reservations served by elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.713(a) and section 611(h)(5) of the Act require that the plan address the coordination of services for all Indian children residing on those reservations.  This includes Indian children residing on those reservations that are enrolled in public schools in the local school district, as well as Indian children that are enrolled in BIA-funded schools.  This also includes Indian students incarcerated in State, local, and tribal juvenile and adult correctional facilities.  We are revising Sec. 300.713(b) to ensure that the plan provides for coordination of services benefiting all Indian children with disabilities, including services provided by SEAs and State, local, and tribal juvenile and adult correctional facilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.713(a) has been revised to require the Secretary of the Interior to develop and implement a plan for the coordination of services for all Indian children with disabilities residing on reservations served by elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  Section 300.713(b) has been revised to require the plan to provide for the coordination of services benefiting these children from whatever source, including SEAs, and State, local, and tribal juvenile and adult correctional facilities.</p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  One commenter requested definitions of "collaboration" and "collaborated teachers."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to define "collaboration" in these regulations, because it is a commonly used term, which means working jointly with others, especially in an intellectual endeavor.  Although the Act does not prohibit the Department from regulating on this issue, we do not believe it is necessary.  The term "collaborated teachers" is not used in the Act or these regulations and, thus, is not appropriate for inclusion in the definitions in these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
