Consistency with State policies (Sec. 300.201)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1568%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring LEAs to seek input from parents of children with disabilities in the development of LEA policies, procedures, and programs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.201, consistent with section 613(a)(1) of the Act, requires each LEA to have in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with State policies and procedures.  It is up to each State and its LEAs to determine the manner in which LEAs develop their policies, procedures, and programs, consistent with State law and procedures.  The Act does not authorize the Department to impose additional obligations on States or LEAs with respect to the development of LEA policies, procedures, and programs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Maintenance of effort (Sec. Sec. 300.202 through 300.205)  <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1572%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the maintenance of effort requirements are complicated and unnecessary and should be eliminated or simplified.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Sections 300.202 through 300.205, regarding maintenance of effort and the LEA's use of funds received under Part B of the Act, reflect the specific statutory requirements in section 613(a)(2) of the Act, as well as necessary information regarding the implementation of these requirements.  Much of the additional information in Sec. Sec. 300.202 through 300.205 was included in various sections throughout the current regulations.  We continue to believe that this information is necessary for the proper implementation of the Act.  Section 300.204(e), which has been newly added to the regulations, includes the assumption of costs by the high cost fund as an additional condition under which an LEA may reduce its level of expenditures.  We believe this provision is necessary because LEAs should not be required to maintain a level of fiscal effort based on costs that are assumed by the SEA's high cost fund.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In short, we have tried to present the regulations relating to LEA maintenance of effort in a clear manner, while being consistent with the language of the Act (which we do not have the authority to change) and including only as much additional information as is necessary to ensure proper implementation of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that LEAs should be permitted to use a reasonable amount of their Part B funds to meet the Act's requirements relating to student assessment, outcomes, complaints, compliance monitoring, mediation, and due process hearings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  With one exception, nothing in the Act or these regulations would prevent an LEA from using its Part B allotment for the activities noted by the commenter, so long as the expenditures meet the other applicable requirements under the Act and regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
LEAs may not use their Part B funds to support the mediation process described in Sec. 300.506.  Consistent with section 615(e)(2)(D) of the Act, Sec. 300.506(b)(4) requires the State (not the LEA) to bear the cost of that mediation process.  Although LEAs may not use their Part B funds to support the mediation process required under Sec. 300.506(b)(4), they may use their Part B funds to support alternative mediation processes that they offer.  Some LEAs (and States) offer alternative mediation processes, in addition to the mediation process required under section 615 of the Act.  These alternative mediation processes generally were established prior to the Federal mandate for mediation and some LEAs (and States) continue to offer parents the option of using these alternative mediation processes to resolve disputes.  Therefore, if an LEA has an alternative mediation process, it may use its Part B funds for this process, so long as parents are provided access to the required mediation process under section 615 of the Act and are not required to use an alternative mediation process in order to engage in the mediation process provided under section 615 of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested clarifying that "per capita" in Sec. 300.203(b) means the amount per child with a disability in an LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to include a definition of "per capita" in Sec. 300.203(b) because we believe that, in the context of the regulations, it is clear that we are using this term to refer to the amount per child with a disability served by the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Exception to maintenance of effort (Sec. 300.204)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1584%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended expanding the exceptions to the maintenance of effort requirements in Sec. 300.204(a) to include negotiated reductions in staff salaries or benefits so that LEAs are not penalized for being proactive in reducing costs.  Another commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.204 to allow LEAs to apply for a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirements in cases of fiscal emergencies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.204(a) through (d) reflects the language in section 613(a)(2)(B) of the Act and clarifies the conditions under which LEAs may reduce the level of expenditures below the level of expenditures for the preceding year.  Nothing in the Act permits an exception for negotiated reductions in staff salaries or benefits or financial emergencies.  Accordingly, to expand the exceptions to the maintenance of effort requirements, as recommended by the commenters, would be beyond the authority of the Department.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested clarification as to whether the exceptions to the maintenance of effort requirements apply to an LEA that uses funds from its SEA's high cost fund under Sec. 300.704(c) during the preceding year.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is necessary because Sec. 300.204(e) clearly states that the assumption of costs by a State-operated high cost fund under Sec. 300.704(c) would be a permissible reason for reducing local maintenance of effort.  This provision was included in the proposed regulations in recognition that the new statutory authority in section 611(e)(3) of the Act that permits States to establish a fund to pay for some high costs associated with certain children with disabilities could logically and appropriately result in lower expenditures for some LEAs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Adjustments to local fiscal efforts in certain fiscal years (Sec. 300.205)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1591%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the link between early intervening services and reductions in maintenance of effort in Sec. 300.205(d) is not in the Act.  Some commenters expressed concern that this requirement forces an LEA to choose between providing early intervening services and directing local funds toward nondisabled children.  One commenter stated that linking the use of funds for early intervening services to reduction in maintenance of effort in Sec. 300.205 is not logical and was not the intent of Congress.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The link between reductions in local maintenance of effort (reflected in Sec. 300.205(d)) and the amount of Part B funds that LEAs may use to provide early intervening services (reflected in Sec. 300.226) is established in the Act.  Section 300.205(d) tracks the statutory language in section 613(a)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act and Sec. 300.226(a) tracks the statutory language in section 613(f)(1) of the Act.  Section 300.205(d) states that the amount of funds expended by an LEA for early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 counts toward the maximum amount of expenditures that an LEA may reduce in its local maintenance of effort.  Section 300.226(a) clearly states that the amount of Part B funds an LEA may use to provide early intervening services may not exceed 15 percent of the funds the LEA receives under Part B of the Act less any amount reduced by the LEA under Sec. 300.205. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As noted in the NPRM, the Department believes it is important to caution LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in accordance with Sec. 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds for early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 because the local maintenance of effort reduction provision and the authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services are interconnected.  The decision that an LEA makes about the amount of funds that it uses for one purpose affects the amount that it may use for the other.  Appendix D to Part 300--Maintenance of Effort and Early Intervening Services includes examples that illustrate how Sec. Sec. 300.205(d) and 300.226(a) affect one another.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA (Sec. 300.206) <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1596%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended specifying in Sec. 300.206(b) that LEAs can use only funds provided under section 611 of the Act (and not section 619 of the Act) to carry out a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the ESEA.  The commenters stated that this change is necessary so that the per capita amount of Federal Part B funds used to carry out a schoolwide program is not artificially inflated by including preschool grant funds that are used to serve children ages three through five who are not placed in a title I school.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 613(a)(2)(D) of the Act specifically provides that an LEA may use any funds it receives under Part B of the Act to carry out schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA.  Part B funds include any funds an LEA receives under sections 611 and 619 of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Personnel development (Sec. 300.207) <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1600%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters suggested requiring LEAs to train their personnel through research-based practices in order to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared to implement Part B of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the regulations already address the commenters' concern and reflect the Department's position that high-quality professional development, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, is important to ensure that personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities.  Section 300.207, consistent with section 613(a)(3) of the Act, requires each LEA to ensure that all personnel necessary to carry out Part B of the Act are appropriately prepared, subject to the requirements in Sec. 300.156 and section 2122 of the ESEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, clearly states that each State must establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  Further, section 2122(b)(1)(B) of the ESEA requires an LEA's application to the State for title II funds (Preparing, training, and recruiting high quality teachers and principals) to address how the LEA's activities will be based on a review of scientifically based research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Purchase of instructional materials (Sec. 300.210) <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1605%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring LEAs to hold public hearings that meet the requirements in section 612(a)(19) of the Act before adopting its policies and procedures to purchase instructional materials.  The commenter stated that all interested members of the public, including parents of children with disabilities, are entitled to participate in designing the plan to meet the requirements in Sec. 300.210.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not require LEAs to hold public hearings before implementing new policies and procedures.  This is a matter for each State to determine, based on its rules governing public hearings and public comment.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate for these regulations to require LEAs to hold public hearings and receive public comment on the LEA's purchase of instructional materials, as requested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirements in Sec. 300.210(b)(3) are unnecessary and should be removed because the Act does not require LEAs to provide accessible materials for children with disabilities for whom assistance is not available from the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.210(b)(3) is necessary because timely access to appropriate and accessible instructional materials is an inherent component of an LEA's obligation under the Act to ensure that FAPE is available for all children with disabilities and that children with disabilities participate in the general curriculum as specified in their IEPs.  Because the NIMAC is not required to serve all children with disabilities who need accessible materials, we believe it is important that the regulations make clear that LEAs are still responsible for ensuring that children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats, but who do not fall within the definition of children who are eligible to receive materials produced from NIMAS files obtained through the NIMAC, receive them in a timely manner.  We, therefore, decline to delete Sec. 300.210(b)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A significant number of commenters expressed concern about allowing LEAs to choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters stated that coordination with the NIMAC should be mandatory for all LEAs.  Other commenters recommended that LEAs that cannot demonstrate a history of providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner should be required to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inconsistent with section 613(a)(6)(B) of the Act to make coordination with the NIMAC mandatory for all LEAs or to require certain LEAs to coordinate with the NIMAC (e.g., LEAs that do not have a history of providing instructional materials to children with disabilities in a timely manner).  Section 613(a)(6)(B) of the Act provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to require any LEA to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested that the regulations clearly define the process LEAs must go through if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters requested additional details on what assurances LEAs must provide if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters requested that LEA assurances provide the public with information to evaluate the capacity of the LEA to provide materials to children who are blind or have print disabilities.  Some commenters stated that the assurances provided by LEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC should be done annually and in writing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters requested that the regulations provide a means for the public to obtain information about which LEAs choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  A few commenters recommended requiring LEAs to report to the Department whether they choose to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Some commenters requested that the Department publish the assurances made in accordance with Sec. 300.210(b) by LEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The process by which LEAs choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC and the assurances that LEAs must provide if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC are determined by each State.  Section 300.210(b)(2), consistent with section 613(a)(6)(B) of the Act, states that, if an LEA chooses not to coordinate with the NIMAC, the LEA must provide an assurance to the SEA that the LEA will provide instructional materials to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.  Therefore, it would be unnecessary and burdensome to require LEAs to provide assurances to the Department or to require LEAs to report to the Department whether they choose to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Each State has its own mechanisms and processes for obtaining assurances from its LEAs, and we believe it would be inappropriate for these regulations to define the process by which LEAs inform the SEA that they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC or to specify the content of the assurances that LEAs must provide to the SEA if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Similarly, it is up to each State to determine whether and how the State will provide information to the public about LEAs in the State that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters proposed that the regulations require LEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC to annually report to the public on when children with disabilities receive their materials, how print materials are provided in a timely manner, and the steps the LEA has taken to ensure that materials are provided at the same time as materials are provided to children without disabilities.  Other commenters recommended requiring LEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC to develop and publish their policies and procedures that govern how they maintain and distribute NIMAS files.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that imposing additional data collection and reporting requirements, such as those requested by the commenters, on LEAs that choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC is a matter that is best left to the States.  States are responsible for ensuring that accessible instructional materials are provided in a timely manner to all children with disabilities who need them, and are, therefore, in the best position to know what controls, if any, are needed in their State to ensure that LEAS comply with the requirements in Sec. 300.210(b)(3).  All LEAs, regardless of whether they choose to coordinate with the NIMAC, must ensure that children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats receive them in a timely manner, consistent with Sec. 300.210(b)(3).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested that the Department provide information to LEAs on the NIMAC and the NIMAS so that LEAs can make an informed choice regarding whether to coordinate with the NIMAC.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department recognizes the need to provide information to LEAs regarding the NIMAC and the NIMAS.

Early intervening services (Sec. 300.226)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CC%2C1625%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that early intervening services should not be used to delay the evaluation of children suspected of having a disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.226(c), which states that nothing in Sec. 300.226 will be construed to delay appropriate evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability, makes clear that early intervening services may not delay an appropriate evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the requirements for early intervening services do not adequately protect the child's right to FAPE and recommended that the requirements include provisions regarding notice, consent, and withdrawal of consent, as well as guidelines for referrals for evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Children receiving early intervening services do not have the same rights and protections as children identified as eligible for services under sections 614 and 615 of the Act.  Section 300.226(c), consistent with section 613(f)(3) of the Act, is clear that early intervening services neither limit nor create a right to FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate or necessary to specify how long a child can receive early intervening services before an initial evaluation is conducted.  If a child receiving early intervening services is suspected of having a disability, the LEA must conduct a full and individual evaluation in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.301, 300.304 and 300.305 to determine if the child is a child with a disability and needs special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters suggested clarifying that Part B funds for early intervening services should not be used for any child previously identified as being a child with a disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  A child previously identified as being a child with a disability who currently does not need special education or related services would not be prevented from receiving early intervening services.  For example, a child who received special education services in kindergarten and had services discontinued in grade 1 (because the public agency and the parent agreed that the child was no longer a child with a disability), could receive early intervening services in grade 2 if the child was found to be in need of additional academic and behavioral supports to succeed in the general education environment.  We believe that language should be added to Sec. 300.226 to clarify that early intervening services are for children who are not currently identified as needing special education or related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have modified Sec. 300.226(a) to clarify that early intervening services are available to children who currently are not identified as needing special education or related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended specifying that unless LEAs have significant over-identification and over-representation of minority students in special education, LEAs may not use Federal Part B funds for early intervening services unless they can demonstrate that all eligible children are receiving FAPE.  Another commenter suggested prohibiting the use of Part B funds for early intervening services if an LEA is not providing FAPE to all eligible children.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not restrict the use of funds for early intervening services only to LEAs that can demonstrate that all eligible children with disabilities are receiving FAPE.  Section 613(f)(1) of the Act generally permits LEAs to use funds for early intervening services for children in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on children in kindergarten through grade 3) who have not been identified as needing special education or related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment.  No other restrictions on this authority, such as a requirement that the LEA first demonstrate that it is providing FAPE to all eligible children, are specified or appropriate.  The authority to use some Part B funds for early intervening services has the potential to benefit special education, as well as the education of other children, by reducing academic and behavioral problems in the regular educational environment and reducing the number of referrals to special education that could have been avoided by relatively simple regular education interventions.  Therefore, we believe the use of Part B funds for early intervening services should be encouraged, rather than restricted.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In one instance, however, the Act requires the use of funds for early intervening services.  Under section 618(d)(2)(B) of the Act, LEAs that are identified as having significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity with respect to the identification of children with disabilities, the placement of children with disabilities in particular educational settings, and the incidence, duration, and type of disciplinary actions taken against children with disabilities, including suspensions and expulsions, are required to reserve the maximum amount of funds under section 613(f)(1) of the Act to provide early intervening services to children in the LEA, particularly to children in those groups that were significantly over-identified.  This requirement is in recognition of the fact that significant disproportionality in special education may be the result of inappropriate regular education responses to academic or behavioral issues.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended permitting LEAs to spend funds for early intervening services on literacy instruction programs that target at-risk limited English proficient students.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that would preclude LEAs from using Part B funds for early intervening services, including literacy instruction, that target at-risk limited English proficient students who have not been identified as needing special education or related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarification as to whether ESAs or other public institutions or agencies, in addition to LEAs, have the authority to provide early intervening services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe any clarification is necessary because Sec. 300.226, consistent with section 613(f) of the Act, states that LEAs may use Part B funds to develop and implement coordinated early intervening services.  As defined in Sec. 300.28(b), local educational agency or LEA includes ESAs and any other public institution or agency having administrative control and direction of a public elementary school or secondary school, including a public nonprofit charter school that is established as an LEA under State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters suggested modifying the regulations to permit children age 3 through 21 to receive early intervening services.  The commenters stated that this change would allow schools to provide early academic and behavioral supports to preschool children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Early intervening services may not be used for preschool children.  Section 300.226(a) tracks the statutory language in section 613(f)(1) of the Act, which states that early intervening services are for children in kindergarten through grade 12, with a particular emphasis on children in kindergarten through grade 3.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying in the regulations that early intervening services are not equivalent to early intervention services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe any changes are necessary to the regulations to clarify the difference between early intervening services provided under Part B of the Act and early intervention services provided under Part C of the Act.  Following is a description of the two types of services:</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Early intervening services provided under section 613(f) of the Act are services for children in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on children in kindergarten through grade 3) who have not been identified as needing special education and related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Early intervention services, on the other hand, are services for children birth through age two that are designed to meet the developmental needs of infants and toddlers with disabilities under section 632 in Part C of the Act.  Section 632(5)(A) of the Act defines infant or toddler with a disability as a child under the age of three years who (a) is experiencing developmental delays in one or more of the areas of cognitive development, physical development, communication development, social or emotional development, and adaptive development, or (b) has a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay.  In addition, some States also provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers who are at risk of having a developmental delay.  The Part C regulations will address, in detail, the early intervention services provided under section 632 of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether the reference to scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions in Sec. 300.226(b) means that such interventions must be aligned with recommended practices and peer-reviewed research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.226(b) follows the specific language in section 613(f)(2) of the Act and requires that in implementing coordinated, early intervening services, an LEA may provide, among other services, professional development for teachers and other personnel to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions.  The use of the term scientifically based in Sec. 300.226(b) is intended to be consistent with the definition of the term scientifically based research in section 9101(37) of the ESEA.  Because this definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion of new Sec. 300.35.  Under the definition, scientifically based research must be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal or approved by a panel of independent experts through a comparably rigorous, objective, and scientific review.  We expect that the professional development activities authorized under Sec. 300.226(b)(1) will be derived from scientifically based research.  The statute and regulations do not refer to "recommended practices," which is a term of art that, generally, refers to practices that the field has adopted as "best practices," and which may or may not be based on evidence from scientifically based research.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested including related services personnel, including speech pathologists and school psychologists, in the development and delivery of educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports for teachers and other school staff to enable them to deliver coordinated, early intervening services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  State and local officials are in the best position to make decisions regarding the provision of early intervening services, including the specific personnel to provide the services and the instructional materials and approaches to be used.  Nothing in the Act or regulations prevents States and LEAs from including related services personnel in the development and delivery of educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports for teachers and other school staff to enable them to deliver coordinated, early intervening services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended revising the regulations to allow public agencies to use Part B funds for early intervening services to purchase supplemental instructional materials to support the activities in Sec. 300.226(b). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that supplemental instructional materials may be used, where appropriate, to support early intervening activities.  The Conf. Rpt. in note 269 provides that </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
[E]arly intervening services should make use of supplemental instructional materials, where appropriate, to support student learning.  Children targeted for early intervening services under IDEA are the very students who are most likely to need additional reinforcement to the core curriculum used in the regular classroom.  These are in fact the additional instructional materials that have been developed to supplement and therefore strengthen the efficacy of comprehensive core curriculum.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe the terms "services" and "supports" in Sec. 300.226(b)(2) are broad enough to include the use of supplemental instructional materials.  Accordingly, we believe that it is unnecessary to add further clarification regarding the use of supplemental instructional materials in Sec. 300.226.  Of course, use of funds for this purpose is subject to other requirements that apply to any use of funds, such as the limitation on purchase of equipment in section 605 of the Act and applicable requirements in 34 CFR Parts 76 and 80.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested requiring LEAs to provide parents with written notice regarding their child's participation in early intervening services, the goals for such services, and an opportunity to refuse services.  Some commenters requested requiring LEAs to inform parents of their child's progress in early intervening services at reasonable intervals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.226, consistent with section 613(f) of the Act, gives LEAs flexibility to develop and implement coordinated, early intervening services for children who are not currently receiving special education services, but who require additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a regular education environment.  Early intervening services will benefit both the regular and special education programs by reducing academic and behavioral problems in the regular education program and the number of inappropriate referrals for special education and related services.  It would be overly restrictive and beyond the Department's authority to modify the regulations to include the additional requirements suggested by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that data should be collected regarding the effectiveness of early intervening services.  Several commenters requested requiring LEAs to report to the SEA, and make available to the public, the number of children receiving early intervening services, the length of time the children received the services, the impact of the services, and the amount of Federal Part B funds used for early intervening services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.226(d), consistent with section 613(f)(4) of the Act, requires LEAs that develop and maintain coordinated, early intervening services to annually report to their SEA on the number of children receiving early intervening services and the number of those children who eventually are identified as children with disabilities and receive special education and related services during the preceding two year period (i.e., the two years after the child has received early intervening services).  We believe that these data are sufficient to provide LEAs and SEAs with the information needed to determine the impact of early intervening services on children and to determine if these services reduce the number of referrals for special education and related services.  Requiring LEAs to collect and report data on the implementation of early intervening services beyond what is specifically required in section 613(f)(4) of the Act is unnecessary and would place additional paperwork burdens on LEAs and SEAs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested that the meaning of the terms "subsequently" and "preceding two year period" in Sec. 300.226(d)(2) be clarified. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.226(d)(2), consistent with section 613(f)(4)(B) of the Act, requires LEAs to report on the number of children who are provided early intervening services who subsequently receive special education and related services under Part B of the Act during the preceding two years to determine if the provision of these services reduces the number of overall referrals for special education and related services.  The Department intends for LEAs to report on children who began receiving special education services no more than two years after they received early intervening services.  For the preceding two year period, the LEA would report on the number of children who received both early intervening services and special education services during those two years.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe any changes to the regulations are necessary because Sec. 300.227(b), consistent with section 613(g)(2) of the Act, clearly states that SEAs providing direct special education and related services must do so in accordance with Part B of the Act.  Accordingly, the special education and related services provided under Sec. 300.227 would be subject to the placement requirements in Sec. 300.116 and the LRE requirements in Sec. 300.114 and section 612(a)(5) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that not all student disciplinary records can be transmitted by public agencies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.229 is clear that not all student disciplinary records can be transmitted by public agencies.  Section 300.229(a) provides that public agencies can transmit disciplinary information on children with disabilities only to the extent that the disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children.  Section 300.229(b) specifies the disciplinary information that may be transmitted, which includes a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child.  Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested that the required transmission of student records include both the child's current IEP and any statement of current or previous disciplinary action related to weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury that has been taken against the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is important to clarify that the Act does not require the transmission of student disciplinary information when the child transfers from one school to another.  Rather, section 613(i) of the Act allows each State to decide whether to require its public agencies to include disciplinary statements in student records and transmit such statements with student records when a child transfers from one school to another.  The State's policy on transmitting disciplinary information must apply to both students with disabilities and students without disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.229(b) provides that if a State requires its public agencies to include disciplinary statements in student records, these disciplinary statements may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child; disciplinary actions taken against a child related to weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury also could be included in these descriptions.  If a State adopts such a policy, Sec. 300.229(c) requires that the transmission of any of the child's student records include the child's current IEP and any statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Therefore, with regard to the commenters' request that the transmission of student records include any statement of current or previous disciplinary action related to weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury that has been taken against the child, this information would be transmitted only to the extent that disciplinary statements are included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring that the transmission of a student's records include functional behavioral assessments and behavior intervention plans.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Any existing functional behavioral assessments and behavioral intervention plans would be part of the materials that must be transmitted under Sec. 300.323(g).  In addition, if a State requires student records to include disciplinary information and the child transfers from one school to another, Sec. 300.229(c) requires that the transmission of any of the child's student records include the child's current IEP.  Functional behavioral assessments and behavior intervention plans are not required components of the IEP under Sec. 300.320.  However, if a State considers functional behavioral assessments and behavior intervention plans to be part of a student's IEP, this information would be required to be transmitted when the child transfers from one school to another, consistent with Sec. 300.229(c).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
