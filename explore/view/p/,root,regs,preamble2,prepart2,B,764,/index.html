Free appropriate public education (FAPE) (Sec. 300.101)  <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.101 to ensure that children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement are provided educational services consistent with State academic achievement standards.  One commenter asked whether children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement must continue to be taught by highly qualified teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the concern raised by the commenter is already addressed by this regulation and elsewhere in the regulations and that no changes to Sec. 300.101 are necessary.  Section 300.530(d), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(D) of the Act, clarifies that a child with a disability who is removed from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons, irrespective of whether the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability, must be allowed to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting his or her IEP goals.  As the term "general education curriculum" is used throughout the Act and in these regulations, the clear implication is that there is an education curriculum that is applicable to all children and that this curriculum is based on the State's academic content standards.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from their current placement in public schools must continue to be taught by highly qualified teachers, consistent with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.156 and 300.18.  Private school teachers are not subject to the highly qualified teacher requirements under this part.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested clarifying in Sec. 300.101 that FAPE must be available to children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended including language in Sec. 300.101(a) specifying that children with disabilities expelled or suspended from the general education classroom must be provided FAPE in the least restrictive environment.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department believes it would not be appropriate to include the requested language in this section because services in these circumstances are provided under somewhat different criteria than is normally the case.  Section 300.530 clarifies the procedures school personnel must follow when removing a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from their current placement (e.g., suspension and expulsion).  This includes how decisions are made regarding the educational services the child receives and the location in which they will be provided.  School officials need some reasonable amount of flexibility in providing services to children with disabilities who have violated school conduct rules, and should not necessarily have to provide exactly the same services, in the same settings, to these children.  Therefore, we decline to regulate further in this regard.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters expressed concern that children with disabilities have to fail or be retained in a grade or course in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.  However, to provide additional clarity we will revise paragraph (c)(1) of this section to explicitly state that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.101(c)(1) has been revised to provide that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Limitation--exception to FAPE for certain ages (Sec. 300.102)  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that children with disabilities who do not receive a regular high school diploma continue to be eligible for special education and related services.  One commenter expressed concern that the provision in Sec. 300.102(a)(3)(ii) regarding children with disabilities who have not been awarded a regular high school diploma could result in the delay of transition services in the context of the child's secondary school experience and postsecondary goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.102(a)(3) is sufficiently clear that public agencies need not make FAPE available to children with disabilities who have graduated with a regular high school diploma and that no change is needed to the regulations.  Children with disabilities who have not graduated with a regular high school diploma still have an entitlement to FAPE until the child reaches the age at which eligibility ceases under the age requirements within the State.  However, we have reviewed the regulations and believe that it is important for these regulations to define "regular diploma" consistent with the ESEA regulations in 34 CFR Sec. 200.19(a)(1)(i).  Therefore, we will add language to clarify that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or general educational development (GED) credential.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe Sec. 300.102 could be interpreted to permit public agencies to delay implementation of transition services, as stated by one commenter because transition services must be provided based on a child's age, not the number of years the child has remaining the child's high school career.  Section 300.320(b), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act, requires each child's IEP to include, beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, appropriate measurable postsecondary goals and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (iv) has been added in Sec. 300.102(a)(3) stating that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or GED.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification as to how States should include children with disabilities who require special education services through age 21 in calculating, for adequate yearly progress (AYP) purposes, the percentage of children who graduate with a regular high school diploma in the standard number of years.  The commenter expressed concern that States, in order to comply with their high school graduation rate academic outcome requirements under the ESEA, will change the grade status from 12th grade to 11th grade for those children with disabilities who will typically age out of the public education system under the Act.  The commenter further stated that this will affect the exception to FAPE provisions in Sec. 300.102 for children with disabilities who require special education services through age 21.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The calculation of graduation rates under the ESEA for AYP purposes (34 CFR 200.19(a)(1)(i)) does not alter the exception to FAPE provisions in Sec. 300.102(a)(3) for children with disabilities who graduate from high school with a regular high school diploma, but not in the standard number of years.  The public agency must make FAPE available until age 21 or the age limit established by State law, even though the child would not be included as graduating for AYP purposes under the ESEA.  In practice, though, there is no conflict between the Act and the ESEA, as the Department interprets the ESEA title I regulations to permit States to propose a method for accurately accounting for students who legitimately take longer than the standard number of years to graduate. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
