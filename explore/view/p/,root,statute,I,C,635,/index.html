the provision of early intervention services                 for any infant or toddler with a disability occurs in a                 setting other than a natural environment that is most                 appropriate, as determined by the parent and the                 individualized family service plan team, only when early                 intervention cannot be achieved satisfactorily for the                 infant or toddler in a natural environment.

Policy.--In implementing subsection (a)(9), a State may adopt a policy that includes making ongoing good-faith efforts to recruit and hire appropriately and adequately trained personnel to provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities, including, in a geographic area of the State where there is a shortage of such personnel, the most qualified individuals available who are making satisfactory progress toward completing applicable course work necessary to meet the standards described in subsection (a)(9).

In general.--A statewide system described in section         633 may include a State policy, developed and implemented         jointly by the lead agency and the State educational agency,         under which parents of children with disabilities who are         eligible for services under section 619 and previously received         services under this part, may choose the continuation of early         intervention services (which shall include an educational         component that promotes school readiness and incorporates         preliteracy, language, and numeracy skills) for such children         under this part until such children enter, or are eligible under         State law to enter, kindergarten.
