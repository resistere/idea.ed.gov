(4)  Section 300.300(c)(1), regarding parental consent for reevaluations, has been modified to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to a reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the consent override procedures in Sec. 300.300(a)(3), and the public agency does not violate its obligation under Sec. 300.111 and Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue the evaluation or reevaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(5)  A new Sec. 300.300(d)(4) has been added to provide that if a parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the parent at the parent's expense, does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or a reevaluation, or the parent fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the public agency (A) may not use the consent override procedures (described elsewhere in Sec. 300.300), and (B) is not required to consider the child eligible for services under the requirements relating to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (Sec. Sec. 300.132 through 300.144).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(6)  A new Sec. 300.300(d)(5) has been added to clarify that in order for a public agency to meet the reasonable efforts requirement to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation, initial services, or a reevaluation, a public agency must document its attempts to obtain parental consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.309 (Determining the existence of a specific learning disability) has been revised, as follows:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(1)  Paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.309 has been changed (A) to clarify that the group described in 300.306 may determine that a child has a specific learning disability if the child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of eight areas (e.g., oral expression, basic reading skill, etc.), when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or State-approved grade-level standards; and (B) to add "limited English proficiency" to the other five conditions that could account for the child's learning problems, and that the group considers in determining whether the child has an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(2)  Section 300.309(b) has been changed to clarify (A) that, in order to ensure that underachievement in a child suspected of having an SLD is not due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math, the group must consider, as part of the evaluation described in Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, data that demonstrate that prior to, or as a part of, the referral process, the child was provided appropriate instruction in regular education settings, delivered by qualified personnel, and (B) to replace (in paragraph (b)(1)) the term "high quality research-based instruction" with "appropriate instruction."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.310, regarding Observation, has been revised, as follows:</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

(2)  A new Sec. 300.310(b) has been added to require the eligibility group to decide to (A) use information obtained from an observation in routine classroom instruction and monitoring of the child's performance that was done before the child was referred for an evaluation, or (B) have at least one member of the group described in Sec. 300.306(a)(1) conduct an observation of the child's academic performance in the regular classroom after the child has been referred for an evaluation and parental consent is obtained.  Paragraph (b) of proposed Sec. 300.310 has been redesignated as new Sec. 300.310(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.311 (Written report) has been renamed "Specific documentation for the eligibility determination," and has been revised, as follows:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(1)  Section 300.311(a)(5), regarding whether the child does not achieve commensurate with the child's age, has been modified and expanded to add whether the child  does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards consistent with Sec. 300.309((a)(1), and (A) the child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards consistent with Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i), or (B) the child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade level standards or intellectual development consistent with Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

(4)  A new Sec. 300.311(a)(7) has been added to provide that if the child has participated in a process that assesses the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, the documentation must include the instructional strategies used and the student-centered data collected, and documentation that the child's parents were notified about (A) the State's policies regarding the amount and nature of student performance data that would be collected and the general education services that would be provided, (B) strategies for increasing the child's rate of learning, and (C) the parents' right to request an evaluation.  </p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Section 300.322, regarding parent participation, has been revised to:  (1) include, in Sec. 300.322(d), examples of the records a public agency must keep of its attempts to involve the parents in IEP meetings; (2) add a new Sec. 300.322(e), which requires the public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the parent understands the proceedings of the IEP meeting, including arranging for an interpreter for parents with deafness or whose native language is other than English; and (3) redesignate paragraph (e) as paragraph (f) accordingly.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.323(d) has been revised to require public agencies to ensure that each regular teacher, special education teacher, related services provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for the implementation of a child's IEP, is informed of his or her specific responsibilities related to implementing the child's IEP and the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided for the child in accordance with the child's IEP.  These are the same requirements in current Sec. 300.342(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.323(e), regarding IEPs for children who transfer public agencies, has been revised to:  (1) divide the provision into three separate paragraphs (Sec. 300.323(e), (f), and (g)) for purposes of clarity and improved readability (e.g., transfers within the same State, transfers from another State, and transmittal of records); (2) adopt "school year" in lieu of "academic year" as the term commonly used by parents and public agencies; and (3) adopt other modifiers (e.g., "new" and "previous") to distinguish between States and public agencies that are involved in transfers by children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.324(a)(4), regarding changes to an IEP after the annual IEP meeting for a school year, has been restructured into two paragraphs, and a new paragraph (a)(4)(ii) has been added to require the public agency to ensure that, if changes are made to a child's IEP without an IEP meeting, that the child's IEP Team is informed of the changes.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.324(b), regarding the review and revision of IEPs, has been changed to include a new paragraph (b)(2), to clarify that, in conducting a review of a child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider the same special factors it considered when developing the child's IEP.</p></p>
