Wards of the State (Sec. 300.519(c))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters stated that the requirements for a surrogate parent for public wards of the State (when a judge overseeing a case appoints a surrogate parent) are less stringent than the requirements for surrogate parents for other children.  The commenters stated that the requirements that surrogate parents have no personal or professional interest that conflicts with the interest of the child, and have knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the child, as required in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, should be required for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State.  One commenter recommended that court-appointed surrogate parents should have to meet Federal requirements for surrogate parents, not the requirements promulgated by LEAs.  The commenter stated that courts may have jurisdiction over cases from more than one school district and should not have to apply different standards depending on which school district is involved.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The criteria for selecting surrogate parents in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), which apply to surrogate parents appointed by a public agency for children with disabilities under Part B of the Act, do not apply to the selection of surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State under the laws of the State.  Section 615(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act provides that, in the case of a child who is a ward of the State, a surrogate parent may alternatively be appointed by the judge overseeing the child's care, provided that the surrogate parent is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the child.  We decline to impose additional requirements for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State beyond what is required in the Act, so as to interfere as little as possible with State practice in appointing individuals to act for the child.  However, we would expect that in most situations, the court-appointed individuals will not have personal or professional interests that conflict with the interests of the child and will have the knowledge and skills to adequately represent the interests of the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that if a parent under Sec. 300.30 is known and the child is a ward of the State, the public agency must appoint a surrogate parent only if the public agency determines that a surrogate parent is needed to protect the educational interests of the child.  The commenter stated that the public agency should not appoint a surrogate parent without approval of a court of competent jurisdiction if the parent is the biological or adoptive parent whose rights to make educational decisions for the child have not been terminated, suspended, or limited. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concern is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.30(b)(1) provides that when there is more than one party attempting to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent must be presumed to be the parent, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters noted that the regulations do not protect a child who is a ward of the tribe in the same manner as a child who is a ward of the State.  The commenters stated that this means that American Indian children have less protection than children of other ethnicities and recommended that the regulations clarify that wards of the State include children who are wards of a tribe of competent jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The definition of State in new Sec. 300.40 (proposed Sec. 300.39) is based on section 602(31) of the Act, which does not include an Indian tribe or tribal governing body.  Therefore, the Department does not have the authority to interpret ward of the State to include children who are wards of a tribe of competent jurisdiction.  However this does not relieve States or the BIA of their responsibility to ensure that the rights of a child who is a ward of a tribe are protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent under Sec. 300.519 when no parent can be identified; when the agency cannot, after reasonable efforts, locate a parent; or when the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
