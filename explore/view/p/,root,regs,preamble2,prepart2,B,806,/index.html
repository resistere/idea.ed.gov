Extended school year services (Sec. 300.106)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing Sec. 300.106 because the requirement to provide extended school year (ESY) services to children with disabilities is not required in the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the ESY requirements in Sec. 300.106 should not be included as part of the State eligibility requirements and would be more appropriately included in the definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17 is taken directly from section 602(9) of the Act.  We believe the ESY requirements are appropriately included under the FAPE requirements as a part of a State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act because the right of an individual child with a disability to ESY services is based on a child's entitlement to FAPE.  As a part of the State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act, the State must make FAPE available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandated age ranges.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended removing the word "only" in Sec. 300.106(a)(2) because it is unduly limiting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The inclusion of the word "only" is intended to be limiting.  ESY services must be provided "only" if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual basis, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324, that the services are necessary for the provision of FAPE to the child.  We do not think this language is overly restrictive; instead, we think it is necessary for providing appropriate parameters to the responsibility of the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters suggested revising Sec. 300.106(a)(3)(i) to specifically state that, in addition to particular categories of disabilities, public agencies may not limit ESY services to particular age ranges.  Other commenters proposed adding "preschooler with a disability" to the definition of ESY services in Sec. 300.106(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The revisions recommended by the commenters are not necessary.  Section 300.106(a) clarifies that each public agency must ensure that ESY services are available for children with disabilities if those services are necessary for the children to receive FAPE.  Section 300.101(a) clearly states that FAPE must be available to all children aged 3 through 21, inclusive, residing in the State, except for children ages 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20, or 21 to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, regarding the provision of public education to children of those ages.  We do not believe any further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that language be added to Sec. 300.106(b)(1)(i) to clarify that providing ESY services to a child with a disability beyond the normal school year includes, but is not limited to, before and after regular school hours, on weekends, and during regular school vacations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Typically, ESY services are provided during the summer months.  However, there is nothing in Sec. 300.106 that would limit a public agency from providing ESY services to a child with a disability during times other than the summer, such as before and after regular school hours or during school vacations, if the IEP Team determines that the child requires ESY services during those time periods in order to receive FAPE.  The regulations give the IEP Team the flexibility to determine when ESY services are appropriate, depending on the circumstances of the individual child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language to Sec. 300.106 clarifying that "recoupment and retention" should not be used as the sole criteria for determining the child's eligibility for ESY services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the commenter's suggested change should be made.  The concepts of "recoupment" and "likelihood of regression or retention" have formed the basis for many standards that States use in making ESY eligibility determinations and are derived from well-established judicial precedents.  (See, for example, Johnson v. Bixby Independent School District 4, 921 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir. 1990); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983); GARC v. McDaniel, 716 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir. 1983)).  States may use recoupment and retention as their sole criteria but they are not limited to these standards and have considerable flexibility in determining eligibility for ESY services and establishing State standards for making ESY determinations.  However, whatever standard a State uses must be consistent with the individually-oriented requirements of the Act and may not limit eligibility for ESY services to children with a particular disability category or be applied in a manner that denies children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE access to necessary ESY services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
