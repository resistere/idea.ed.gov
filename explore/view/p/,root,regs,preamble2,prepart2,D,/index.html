Comment:  A few commenters noted that the terms, "consent," "informed consent," "agree," and "agree in writing" are used throughout the regulations and stated that differences between the terms should be clarified.  One commenter recommended that the regulations include the term "informed" every time the term "parental consent" is used. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The use of these terms throughout the regulations is consistent with their use in the Act.  The definition of consent in Sec. 300.9 includes the requirement that a parent be fully informed of all information relevant to the activity for which consent is sought.  The definition also requires that a parent agree in writing to carrying out the activity for which the parent's consent is sought.  Therefore, whenever the term "consent" is used in these regulations, it means that the consent is both "informed" and "written."  Similarly, the terms "consent," "informed consent," "parental consent," and "written informed consent," as used in these regulations, all are intended to have the same meaning.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The meaning of the terms "agree" or "agreement" is not the same as "consent."  "Agree" or "agreement" refer to an understanding between the parent and the LEA about a particular question or issue.  There is no requirement that an agreement be in writing unless specifically stated in the Act and regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify what the required safeguards are if parents elect to receive notices electronically or provide electronic or digital signatures for consents, such as consent for an initial evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.505, consistent with section 615(n) of the Act, permits parents to elect to receive prior written notices, procedural safeguards notices, and due process complaint notices by an electronic mail communication, if the public agency makes that option available.  The Act does not specify documentation requirements if the public agency makes the electronic notice delivery option available to parents, and we believe that this is a matter that is best left to States and LEAs that choose to use the electronic communication option.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, States that wish to utilize electronic or digital signatures for consent may do so if they choose.  Consent under Sec. 300.9(b) requires a parent to understand and agree in writing to the carrying out of the activity for which the parent's consent is sought.  Therefore, States that permit the use of electronic or digital signatures for parental consent would need to take the necessary steps to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards to protect the integrity of the process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">
Parental consent for initial evaluation (Sec. 300.300(a))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C1701%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require a public agency to conduct the following activities to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation:  identify the child's parents and their address and phone number; contact social service providers for children who are wards of the State; provide parents with copies of the Act; and inform parents of the consequences of withholding consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The regulations already provide sufficient safeguards regarding consent, and we believe that the changes requested would be unduly burdensome.  As a matter of practice, public agencies begin the process of obtaining parental consent by identifying the parent and contacting the parent by phone or through written correspondence, or speaking to the parent in parent-teacher conferences.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is necessary to regulate to require public agencies to contact social service agencies to obtain consent for children who are wards of the State because it may not always be necessary or appropriate, for example, when a child who is a ward of the State has a foster parent who can act as a parent, consistent with Sec. 300.30(a)(2).  Additionally, section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act provides that the public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent for children who are wards of the State and not residing with the parent.  Public agencies are in the best position to determine, on a case-by-case basis, when it is necessary to contact social service providers to assist in obtaining parental consent for children who are wards of the State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also do not believe that additional regulations are necessary to require public agencies to inform parents of the consequences of withholding consent for an initial evaluation or to provide parents with copies of the Act.  Section 300.503, consistent with section 615(c)(1) of the Act, already requires that prior written notice be provided to parents before an initial evaluation, which will explain, among other things, why the agency is proposing to conduct the evaluation; a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for proposing to conduct the evaluation; and sources for the parent to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions under the Act.  Additionally, Sec. 300.504(a)(1), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, requires the public agency to provide a copy of the procedural safeguards to parents upon initial referral for an evaluation, which provides information about parents' rights under the Act.  Although we do not believe the recommended requirements should be added to the regulations, we will add the cross-references to the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9, and the requirements for prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice in Sec. Sec. 300.503 and 300.504, respectively, to Sec. 300.300(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added cross-references to Sec. Sec. 300.9, 300.503, and 300.504 in Sec. 300.300(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii) and using the statutory language in section 614(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to require that parental consent for evaluation may not be construed as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is appropriate to use the phrase, "initial provision of services" in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii), rather than the statutory phrase "consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services," in section 614(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to clarify that consent does not need to be sought every time a particular service is provided to the child.  In addition, the distinction between consent for an initial evaluation and consent for initial services is more clearly conveyed in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii) than in the statutory language, and is consistent with the Department's longstanding position that "placement" refers to the provision of special education services, rather than a specific place, such as a specific classroom or specific school.  We, therefore, decline to change the regulation, as requested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify whether the reference to "parent" in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) means "biological or adoptive parent" or anyone who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(2) applies to circumstances in which the child is a ward of the State and is not residing with the child's parents, and requires the public agency to make reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent from the parent for an initial evaluation.  The reference to "parent," in this context, refers to anyone who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30, consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification on the interplay between new Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), regarding circumstances when the public agency is not required to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation of a child who is a ward of the State, and the requirements in Sec. 300.519(c), which require that a surrogate parent be appointed for a child who is a ward of the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II) of the Act, creates an exception to the parental consent requirements for initial evaluations for a child who is a ward of the State who is not residing with the child's parent if the public agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain the parent's consent, but is unable to discover the whereabouts of the parent, the rights of the parent of the child have been terminated under State law, or the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge under State law and consent for the initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)) permits the public agency to proceed with the child's initial evaluation without first obtaining the requisite parental consent only in the circumstances detailed in Sec. 300.300(a)(2).  Therefore, when one or more of the circumstances in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) are met and a surrogate has not yet been appointed, the public agency need not postpone the child's evaluation to await the appointment of a surrogate.  This is appropriate because in situations involving requests for initial evaluations, in most cases a surrogate parent has not yet been appointed and delaying an initial evaluation until after a surrogate is appointed and has given consent may not be in the best interests of the child.  In contrast, in most situations involving consent for reevaluation, a surrogate parent should already have been appointed under Sec. 300.519 if no parent can be identified, the public agency has been unable to locate a parent, the child is a ward of the State or the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth.  Therefore, we do not think it is appropriate to apply the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) to reevaluation situations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Nothing in this section is intended to relieve a public agency of its obligation to ensure that the rights of a child who is a ward of the State are protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 300.519(b) through (h).  Once a surrogate parent is appointed in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 300.519(b) through (h), that person assumes the responsibilities of a parent under the Act, and the public agency must seek consent from that individual. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Moreover, if a child has a foster parent who can act as a parent, as defined in Sec. 300.30(a)(2), or a person such as a grandparent or step-parent who is legally responsible for the child's welfare, and that person's whereabouts are known or the person can be located after reasonable efforts by the public agency, parental consent would be required for the initial evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that the phrase "except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding consent for wards of the State)" in proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(i) may incorrectly convey that a public agency is not required to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent of a child who is a ward of the State, or from a surrogate parent, foster parent, or other person meeting the definition of a parent in Sec. 300.30(a).  Therefore, we will remove the phrase.  To clarify that the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) apply only to initial evaluations, and not reevaluations, we will modify both Sec. Sec. 300.300(a)(2) and (c)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (regarding consent for wards of the State)" in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(i), for clarity.  We have also added introductory language to Sec. 300.300(a)(2) to specify that it applies only to initial evaluations, and we have changed the cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to refer to Sec. 300.300(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations specify the minimum steps that public agencies must take to obtain consent for initial evaluations from parents of children who are wards of the State.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations define "reasonable efforts," as used in new Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i)).  One commenter recommended requiring LEAs to maintain documentation of their efforts to obtain parental consent for initial evaluations, including attempts to obtain consent by telephone calls, visits to the parent's home, and correspondence in the parent's native language.  Several commenters requested that the requirements in current Sec. 300.345(d) be included in new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(A)).  Current Sec. 300.345(d) requires a public agency to document the specific steps it has taken to arrange a mutually convenient time and place for an IEP Team meeting (e.g., detailed records of telephone calls, any correspondence sent to the parents, visits made to the parent's home or place of employment) and it is cross-referenced in current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) to identify documentation of the reasonable measures that an LEA took to obtain consent for a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is important to emphasize that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This includes the parent of a child who is a ward of the State.  Therefore, we will add a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to Sec. 300.300 to make clear that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent whenever a public agency seeks to conduct an initial evaluation of a child to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This requirement applies to all children including children who are wards of the State.  With the addition of this new paragraph, the requirement for public agencies to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation for children who are wards of the State in Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) is no longer necessary and will be removed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also agree with the commenters that a public agency should document and make the same reasonable efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation from a parent, including a parent of a child who is a ward of the State, that are required when a public agency attempts to arrange a mutually convenient time and place for an IEP Team meeting (e.g., detailed records of telephone calls, any correspondence sent to the parents, visits made to the parent's home or place of employment), and will add a new paragraph (d)(5) to make this clear.  We recognize that the statute uses both "reasonable measures" and "reasonable efforts" when referring to a public agency's responsibility to obtain parental consent for an evaluation, initial services, and a reevaluation.  We believe these two phrases, when used in this context, have the same meaning and, therefore, have used "reasonable efforts" throughout the regulations related to parental consent for consistency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to Sec. 300.300 to require a public agency to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation.  We will remove Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) because it is redundant with the new paragraph.  Section 300.300(a)(2) has been reformatted consistent with the removal of paragraph (a)(2)(i).  We also have added a new paragraph (d)(5) to Sec. 300.300 to require a public agency to document its attempts to obtain parental consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters asked whether a public agency must obtain consent for an initial evaluation from the biological or adoptive parent of the child when there is another person who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30.  Another commenter recommended the regulations clarify whether a public agency must seek informed consent for an initial evaluation from a biological or adoptive parent when a surrogate parent has already been appointed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(1) provides that, when more than one party is qualified to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent, when attempting to act as the parent under the Act, must be presumed to be the parent, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a surrogate parent already has been appointed because the public agency, after reasonable efforts, could not locate a parent, the public agency would not have to again attempt to contact other individuals meeting the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30 to seek consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify whether the qualifications of a judge-appointed surrogate parent in Sec. 300.519(c) would apply to new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)), regarding consent for an initial evaluation for a child who is a ward of the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II)(cc) of the Act, which is the basis for new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)), provides that the public agency is not required to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation of a child who is a ward of the State and is not living with the child's parent if the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  This is a special situation, limited only to children who are wards of the State not living with a parent and limited only to the situation of seeking consent for an initial evaluation.  A person appointed under this provision is not a surrogate parent as that term is used in these regulations.  The requirements of Sec. 300.519(c) do not apply to persons authorized to provide consent for initial evaluations under this provision. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is noteworthy that the provision in new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)) is only a limited exception to the requirement to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation.  Most children will not have a surrogate parent already appointed at this stage of their involvement with services under the Act.  However, if a child has a surrogate parent appointed under Sec. 300.519(c), and the rights of that person to make educational decisions for the child have not been subrogated by a judge under State law, the public agency would have to seek informed parental consent from that person.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.300(a)(3) to prohibit a public agency from pursuing an initial evaluation without parental consent.  Another commenter recommended requiring a public agency to use the due process procedures to conduct an initial evaluation if the parent does not provide consent and the public agency believes that the child would not otherwise receive needed services.  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.300(a)(3) is inconsistent with statutory language and opposed language stating that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of a child whose parents have refused to consent or failed to respond to a request for consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(3) is consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act, which states that a public agency may pursue the initial evaluation of a child using the procedural safeguards if a parent does not provide consent or fails to respond to a request to provide consent for an initial evaluation.  Consistent with the Department's position that public agencies should use their consent override procedures only in rare circumstances, Sec. 300.300(a)(3) clarifies that a public agency is not required to pursue an initial evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability if the parent does not provide consent for the initial evaluation.  State and local educational agency authorities are in the best position to determine whether, in a particular case, an initial evaluation should be pursued.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying the parental consent requirements for an initial evaluation.  Many commenters recommended that LEAs maintain documentation that the parent has been fully informed and understands the nature and scope of the evaluation.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require that informed parental consent for an initial evaluation be documented in writing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(I) of the Act, is clear that the public agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8 must obtain consent from the parent of the child before conducting the evaluation.  Consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9, means that the parent has been fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, and understands and agrees in writing to the initial evaluation.  The methods by which a public agency seeks to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation (beyond the requirement that the public agency use the parent's native language or mode of communication) and how a public agency documents its efforts to obtain the parent's written consent are appropriately left to the discretion of SEAs and LEAs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations include language clarifying that a public agency is not in violation of the FAPE requirements if the public agency does not pursue an initial evaluation when the parent refuses to consent or fails to respond to a request for consent.  One commenter recommended adding language to the regulations to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to an initial evaluation, the child would not be considered to be a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While we agree that a public agency would not be in violation of the FAPE requirements for failing to pursue an initial evaluation through due process, we do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary.  The FAPE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.101 through 300.112, consistent with section 612(a) of the Act, apply only to a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8 and section 602(3) of the Act.  A child would not be considered a child with a disability under the Act if the child has not been evaluated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 and determined to have one of the disabilities in Sec. 300.8(a), and because of that disability, needs special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Further, Sec. 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability, for disciplinary purposes, if a parent has not allowed the child to be evaluated or refuses services under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We agree that States and LEAs should not be considered to be in violation of their obligation to locate, identify, and evaluate children suspected of being children with disabilities under Sec. 300.111 and section 612(a)(3) of the Act if they decline to pursue an evaluation (or reevaluation) to which a parent has refused or failed to consent.

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations define "fails to respond" as used in Sec. 300.300(a)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(3), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that if a parent of a child enrolled in public school, or seeking to be enrolled in public school, does not provide consent for an initial evaluation, or the parent "fails to respond" to a request to provide consent, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedural safeguards, if appropriate, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such parental consent.  The meaning of "fails to respond," in this context, is generally understood to mean that, in spite of a public agency's efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation, the parent has not indicated whether the parent consents or refuses consent to the evaluation.  We believe the meaning is clear in the regulations and, therefore, decline to define the phrase in these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations include language to require a public agency to provide the following information (in the parent's native language) to a parent who refuses consent or fails to respond to a request for consent for an initial evaluation:  the reasons why the public agency believes the child may be eligible for special education; confirmation that the requested evaluation and any subsequent special education services will be provided at no cost and scheduled in cooperation with parents with transportation provided; the nature of the evaluations and credentials of evaluators; the types of special education services that the child could receive if eligible; and the risks of delaying an evaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The prior written notice requirements in Sec. 300.503, consistent with section 615(c)(1) of the Act, address many of the concerns raised by the commenter.  Consistent with Sec. 300.503(b) and (c), prior notice must be given to the parents when a public agency proposes to evaluate a child and would explain why the public agency believes the child needs an evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability under the Act; describe each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for proposing that the child needs an evaluation; explain that the parents have protection under the Act's procedural safeguards; provide sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions of the Act; and describe other factors that are relevant to the agency's proposal to conduct the evaluation of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In addition to the prior written notice, Sec. 300.504(a)(1), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents upon an initial referral or parental request for an evaluation.  Consistent with Sec. 300.503(c) and Sec. 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and be provided in the native language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As a matter of practice, public agencies provide parents with general information about the special education and related services that are available to eligible children with disabilities and inform the parent that the public agency's evaluation is provided at no cost.  We believe that this information, along with the information provided in the prior written notice and procedural safeguards notice, will help a parent determine whether there are any risks of delaying an evaluation.  Therefore, we do not believe additional regulations are necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to information regarding an evaluator's credentials, we do not believe it is necessary to require public agencies to provide this information to parents because Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(v) and section 614(b)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act require the public agency to ensure that the evaluation is conducted by trained and knowledgeable personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If transportation to an evaluation outside the school environment is necessary, the public agency would have to provide it, as a part of its obligation to ensure that all eligible children are located, identified, and evaluated.  However, we do not believe that the parents need to be notified of this fact because, in most cases, children can be evaluated at school during the school day and there is no requirement that a parent be present during the evaluation.  Thus, requiring that all parents be notified about transportation to evaluations would be unnecessarily burdensome.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

In addition, a public agency may not initiate a due process hearing to provide special education and related services to a child when a parent refuses to consent to initial services, consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act.

Comment:  One commenter stated that additional documentation is necessary if a parent does not provide consent for initial services and suggested adding language to the regulations to require public agencies to document the steps they have taken to obtain parental consent for initial services and to maintain them in the child's permanent file.  Another commenter recommended requiring that the parent's refusal to consent for initial services occur during a properly convened IEP Team meeting.  The commenter also suggested requiring that the documentation of a parent's refusal to provide consent include evidence that all options waived by the parent have been explained, that the parent has refused services, and the reasons for the parent's refusal.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related services to the child and will make this clear in Sec. 300.300(b).  We noted in our discussion regarding the reasonable efforts that a public agency must make to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, that we added a new paragraph (d)(5) to Sec. 300.300 that provides that to meet the reasonable efforts requirement, a public agency must document its attempts to obtain consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).  We believe a public agency should make these same reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent for initial services, and will include this in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require a public agency to maintain additional documentation, beyond that required in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5), of a parent's refusal to provide consent for initial services or to prescribe where this documentation must be obtained or maintained.  Public agencies understand the importance of properly documenting a parent's refusal to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services and are in the best position to determine any additional documentation that is necessary and where to obtain and maintain such documentation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(2) to Sec. 300.300 to clarify that the public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.  Subsequent paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly.  We also have included a reference to new Sec. 300.300(b)(2) in new Sec. 300.300(d)(5) that requires a public agency to document its attempts to obtain consent using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The language requested by the commenter is not necessary because section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act already provides for situations in which a parent refuses consent for initial services and the child subsequently engages in behavior that violates a code of student conduct.  Section 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, or has refused services under this part.

Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern about new Sec. 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)), which provides that if a parent fails to consent for initial services or refuses to respond to a request for consent, the public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for the child.  A few commenters stated that this should be permitted only when a parent refuses services, but not when a parent fails to respond to a request for consent for initial services.  A few commenters stated that the regulations should be revised to clarify that this applies only to subsequent IEP Team meetings, not the initial IEP Team meeting.  One commenter recommended revising the regulations to require an IEP Team meeting to be held and an IEP developed to provide a basis for informed consent. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)) follows the specific language in section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(III)(bb) of the Act and reflects the new provision in the Act that relieves public agencies of any potential liability for failure to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for a child whose parents have refused consent or failed to respond to a request for consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.  It does not, however, prevent a public agency from convening an IEP Team meeting and developing an IEP for a child as a means of informing the parent about the services that would be provided with the parent's consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We understand the commenters' concern that a parent of a child with a disability who refuses to consent to the provision of special education and related services may not fully understand the extent of the special education and related services their child would receive without the development of an IEP for their child.  However, we do not view the consent provisions of the Act as creating the right of parents to consent to each specific special education and related service that their child receives.  Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.  "Fully informed," in this context, means that a parent has been given an explanation of what special education and related services are and the types of services that might be found to be needed for their child, rather than the exact program of services that would be included in an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended allowing public agencies to use the due process procedures to override a parent's refusal to consent to a reevaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Override of parental refusal to consent to a reevaluation is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.300(c) states that each public agency must obtain informed parental consent in accordance with Sec. 300.300(a)(1) prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability.  Section 300.300(a)(3) allows a public agency to override parental refusal to consent to an initial evaluation by utilizing the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516.  The cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(i) to the provision in Sec. 300.300(a)(1) provides the basis for allowing a public agency to override the parent's refusal of consent to a reevaluation.  However, we believe it is important to state this more directly and will, therefore, add language to Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to a reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have restructured Sec. 300.300(c)(1) and added a new Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(ii) to clarify that a public agency may, but is not required to, pursue a reevaluation using the procedural safeguards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

One commenter suggested that if the requirements in current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) were not retained, the regulations should define reasonable measures as at least three good-faith attempts to contact a parent.  Many commenters stated that current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) must be retained because it is protected by section 607(b) of the Act, which provides that the Secretary may not publish final regulations that would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to children with disabilities in the regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations include language clarifying that a public agency is not authorized to override the lack of parental consent for an initial evaluation for children who are home schooled or placed in a private school by the parents at their own expense.  One commenter recommended removing the phrase "public school or seeking to enroll in public school" in Sec. 300.300(a)(3) to permit a public agency to override lack of parental consent for children who are home schooled or placed in a private school by parents at their own expense.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters who recommended that, for children who are home schooled or placed in a private school by their parents at their own expense, consent override should not be permitted.  We will add a new paragraph (4) to Sec. 300.300(d) to make this clear.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.  In addition, children who do not receive appropriate educational services may develop behavioral problems that have a negative impact on the learning environment for other children.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
By contrast, once parents opt out of the public school system, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children.  In such cases, it would be overly intrusive for the school district to insist on an evaluation over a parent's objection.  The Act gives school districts no regulatory authority over private schools.  Moreover, the Act does not require school districts to provide FAPE to children who are home schooled or enrolled in private schools by their parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Public agencies do have an obligation to actively seek parental consent to evaluate children attending private schools (including children who are home schooled, if a home school is considered a private school under State law) who are suspected of being children with disabilities under the Act, in order to properly identify the number of private school children with disabilities and consider those children as eligible for equitable services under Sec. Sec. 300.132 through 300.144.  However, this obligation does not extend to overriding refusal of parental consent to evaluate parentally-placed private school children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.300(a)(3) provides that a public agency may override parental consent for an initial evaluation only for children who are enrolled in public school or seeking to be enrolled in public school, so we are not making the suggested change in Sec. 300.300(a)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment: Some commenters, including parents, teachers, and State 
educational agencies (SEAs), supported the requirements in proposed 
Sec.  300.300(b)(4) that would allow a parent of a child receiving 
special education and related services to revoke consent for those 
services. Commenters stated that if a parent has the right to initially 
consent to special education and related services, the parent also 
should have the right to revoke consent for special education and 
related services, particularly given that the plain language in Sec.  
300.9(c)(1) states that consent may be revoked at any time. Other 
commenters stated that parents are the ultimate experts on their 
children and have a fundamental right to direct their education. One 
commenter stated that schools should not have the right to force 
evaluations or services on a child through legal processes. Another 
commenter stated that a student should have every right to attempt to 
become independent and take responsibility for his or her academic 
achievement, without the assistance of an individualized education 
program (IEP).
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Some commenters generally supported a parent's right to revoke 
consent, but only if changes were made to proposed Sec.  300.300(b)(4). 
Their recommendations included giving a parent the right to revoke 
consent at any time while still ensuring that the parent receives the 
time and information needed to make informed decisions regarding his or 
her child's continued need for services. Several commenters recommended 
procedures that could be implemented when a parent unilaterally revokes 
consent for special education and related services. For example, 
commenters suggested requiring--that a parent's revocation be in 
writing; a meeting between the parent and the public agency to discuss 
the parent's decision to revoke consent for special education and 
related services; a timeline from the revocation of consent through 
discontinuation of services and a specific deadline for convening a 
meeting with the parent and providing prior written notice to the 
parent; written notice of the receipt of the parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue 
services; and that the parent be given an opportunity to meet with the 
State's Parent Training Information center (PTI) to receive additional 
information concerning the potential impact of the parent's decision. 
Other suggested procedures included requiring a parent to acknowledge 
in writing that the parent has been fully informed of the educational 
services and supports that their child will no longer receive. In 
contrast, a few commenters stated that no additional procedures should 
be required when a parent revokes consent.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We appreciate the commenters' support for this 
provision. We agree with the commenters that revocation of consent for 
special education and related services must be in writing to ensure 
that both the public agency and the parent have documentation that the 
child will no longer receive special education and related services. 
Therefore, we have revised Sec. Sec.  300.9(c)(3) and 300.300(b)(4) to 
require that consent be revoked in writing.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the comments about written notice of the receipt of a 
parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue 
services and the comment concerning an opportunity to meet with the 
State's PTI center to receive additional information about the 
potential effect of the parent's decision, we have not adopted 
additional procedures for parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services because the regulations already provide 
sufficient notice protections to enable parents to understand the 
implications of the decision they are making. To clarify this point, we 
have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to specify that prior written 
notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 be provided to parents before a 
public agency discontinues special education and related services to 
their child. Public agencies, under Sec.  300.503, are required to give 
the parents of a child with a disability written notice that meets the 
requirements in Sec.  300.503(b) within a reasonable time before the 
public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the 
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or 
the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the 
child. Once a public agency receives a parent's written revocation of 
consent for a child's receipt of special education and related 
services, the public agency, under Sec.  300.503, must provide prior 
written notice to the parent regarding the change in educational 
placement and services that will result from the revocation of consent. 
The notice must include, among other matters, information on sources 
for the parents to contact that can assist the parents in understanding 
the requirements of Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations. 
Section 300.503(c)(1)(i) also requires that this prior notice be 
written in language understandable to the general public. It is 
imperative that the public agency provide the required prior notice in 
a meaningful manner. Accordingly, Sec.  300.503(c)(1)(ii) requires that 
any notice required by Sec.  300.503 must be provided in the native 
language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the 
parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. Additionally, if 
the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a 
written language, Sec.  300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to 
take additional measures to communicate the information contained in 
the notice. These measures involve taking steps to ensure that the 
notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in the 
parent's native language or other mode of communication, that the 
parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written 
evidence that the requirements of Sec.  300.503(c) have been met.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the comment about ensuring that the parent receives the 
time and information needed to make informed decisions regarding their 
child's continued need for services, a public agency cannot discontinue 
services until prior written notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 has 
been provided to the parents. Therefore, we expect public agencies to 
promptly respond to receipt of written revocation of consent by 
providing prior written notice to the parents under Sec.  300.503. 
Section 300.503 specifies that, within a reasonable time before a 
public agency discontinues services, the public agency must provide the 
parents of a child with a disability written notice of the proposal to 
discontinue services based on receipt of the parent's written 
revocation of consent. Providing such notice a reasonable time before 
the public agency discontinues services gives parents the necessary 
information and time to fully consider the change and determine if they 
have any additional questions or concerns regarding the discontinuation 
of services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
While the notice required under Sec.  300.503 provides sufficient 
information to parents regarding revocation of consent for special 
education and related services, a State may choose to establish 
additional procedures for implementing Sec.  300.300(b)(4), such as 
requiring a public agency to offer to meet with parents to discuss 
concerns for their child's education. However, the State must ensure 
that any additional procedures are voluntary for the parents, do not 
delay or deny the discontinuation of special education and related 
services, and are otherwise consistent with the requirements under Part 
B of the Act and its implementing regulations. For example, while a 
public agency may inquire as to why a parent is revoking consent for 
special education and related services, a public agency may not require 
a parent to provide an explanation, either orally or in writing, prior 
to ceasing the provision of special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the suggestion that the Department establish a timeline 
from revocation of consent through discontinuation of services with a 
specific deadline for convening a meeting with the parent and providing 
prior written notice to the parent, we expect the discontinuation of 
services to occur in a timely manner. However, we understand that the 
specific timeline may differ, to some extent, due to parent-specific 
factors, such as whether the parent wants to meet with the public 
agency or another entity prior to the discontinuation of services. 
Thus, to provide needed flexibility, we have not mandated a specific 
timeline.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment about ensuring parents acknowledge in 
writing that they have been fully informed of the educational services 
and supports that they are declining, it is the Department's position 
that the prior written notice informs parents of the educational 
services and supports that they are declining and establishes a 
sufficient record that parents have been appropriately informed.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also note that under Sec.  300.504, public agencies must provide 
parents, at least annually, a procedural safeguards notice that 
includes a full explanation of the procedural safeguards available to 
the parents of a child with a disability. This notice must explain the 
requirements in Sec.  300.300, including that a parent has the right to 
revoke consent, in writing, to his or her child's continued receipt of 
special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: We have added the phrase ``in writing'' after the words 
``revokes consent'' in Sec. Sec.  300.9(c)(3) and 300.300(b)(4). We 
also have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to clarify that a public 
agency must provide prior written notice in accordance with Sec.  
300.503 before ceasing the provision of special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Many commenters opposed the requirements in proposed Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) that would allow a parent to revoke consent for special 
education and related services. These commenters stated that the 
decision to terminate services should be made by the IEP Team because 
the IEP Team includes both the parent and professionals. Some 
commenters stated that children cannot be placed unilaterally into 
special education because eligibility for special education and related 
services is determined by a group of qualified individuals and the 
parent; therefore, if a parent believes special education services are 
not needed, the parent should consult with the IEP Team rather than 
making that determination unilaterally.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Other commenters suggested that when a parent believes his or her 
child is not progressing, an IEP Team meeting should be held so that 
the IEP Team, as a whole and not just the parent, can determine whether 
the level of services is appropriate for the child. The commenters 
stated that allowing the IEP Team to determine whether the child needs 
special education and related services, rather than allowing parental 
revocation of consent, would be in the child's best interest.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that revoking consent should be treated 
differently than refusing to provide initial consent because revoking 
consent results in changing the status quo (i.e., terminating services 
that are currently being provided to the child). This commenter argued 
that the party seeking a change in the status quo should bear the 
burden of showing that the change is warranted. One commenter expressed 
concern specifically about a situation in which a parent revokes 
consent for special education and related services for a child placed 
in a residential setting.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter expressed concern that allowing a parent to 
revoke consent goes too far beyond providing for meaningful parental 
participation because it gives the parent a right to veto the IEP Team.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree with the commenters that the IEP Team (defined 
in Sec.  300.23, which includes the child's parents) plays an important 
role in the special education decision-making process. For example, 
through the development, review and revision of the child's IEP, the 
IEP Team determines how to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. However, the IEP Team does not have the authority to 
consent to the provision of special education and related services to a 
child. That authority is given exclusively to the parent under section 
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act. The Secretary strongly believes that a 
parent also has the authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending 
the provision of special education and related services to their child. 
Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of 
special education and related services at any time is consistent with 
the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's 
rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and 
choice in their child's education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We expect that after a parent revokes consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services, the parent will 
continue to work with the child's school to support the child in the 
general education curriculum. Parents of nondisabled children serve as 
partners in their children's education in the same manner as parents of 
children with disabilities.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree that an IEP Team meeting should be convened if any member 
of the IEP Team, including a parent, believes the child is not 
progressing. Section 300.324(b)(1)(i) and (ii)(A) requires each public 
agency to review a child's IEP periodically, but not less than 
annually, and revise the IEP as appropriate to address any lack of 
expected progress. However, the review of a child's IEP by the IEP Team 
does not replace a parent's right to revoke consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services to his or her 
child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the comment that revoking consent should be treated 
differently than refusing to provide initial consent because the parent 
is seeking to terminate special education services that are presently 
provided, thus seeking to change the status quo and the comment 
expressing concern about revoking consent for a child whose current 
placement is in a residential setting, we appreciate that there are 
differences between consent for special education and related services 
and revocation of such consent. However, at their core, both issues 
entail a parent's decision of whether a child will receive special 
education and related services. Thus, section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and 
(ii)(II) of the Act, which provides a parent unilateral authority to 
refuse special education and related services, informs our decision on 
the related issue of revocation of consent for the continued provision 
of special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Lastly, we disagree with the comments that allowing parents to 
revoke consent exceeds the parental participation requirements in Part 
B of the Act. As previously discussed, a parent's right to revoke 
consent is consistent with the parent's right, in section 
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and (ii)(II) of the Act, to determine if his or her 
child should receive special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Many commenters stated that parents may revoke consent for 
various reasons or beliefs that are not in the best interest of the 
child. Commenters provided specific examples such as conflicts between 
the parent and school personnel; an insufficient understanding or 
knowledge of the importance of special education and related services; 
a belief that continued participation in the special education program 
would hinder the child's success in life or stigmatize the child; and 
concerns that the special education program is not appropriate. The 
commenters expressed concern that parental revocation of consent for 
special education and related services could be detrimental to the 
academic future of a child with a disability, as well as the academic 
future and safety of children in the general education classroom.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Other commenters expressed concern that allowing a parent to 
unilaterally revoke consent for the continued provision of special 
education and related services is not in the best interest of the child 
because these children may not receive instruction from trained 
professionals.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: A parent, under section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and 
(ii)(II) of the Act, has the authority to consent to the initial 
provision of special education and related services, and this parental 
right applies regardless of the parent's reasons. As previously 
discussed, the Secretary believes that a parent also should have the 
authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending the provision of 
special education and related services to their child. Allowing parents 
to revoke consent for special education and related services at any 
time is consistent with the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in 
protecting their child's rights and the Department's goal of enhancing 
parent involvement and choice in their child's education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the comments asserting that parental revocation of 
consent for special education and related services could be detrimental 
to the academic future of a child with a disability, the Act presumes 
that a parent acts in the best interest of their child. If a child experiences academic difficulties after a parent revokes consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services, nothing 
in the Act or the implementing regulations would prevent a parent from 
requesting an evaluation to determine if the child is eligible, at that 
time, for special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Safety of all students in the classroom is of primary concern to 
the Secretary. The Department expects that schools will continue to 
maintain the safety of all students in all classrooms regardless of 
whether children are receiving special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not agree with the commenters that students whose parents 
revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services will no longer receive instruction from trained 
professionals. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as 
amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (ESEA), requires that 
all teachers in a State who are teaching core academic subjects be 
``highly qualified.'' Therefore, States are required to ensure that 
students in both general and special education programs are receiving 
instruction in core academic subjects from highly qualified teachers, 
as that term is defined in section 9101 of the ESEA and 34 CFR 200.56.

Comment: A few commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) may result in students removing themselves from services 
when they reach the age of majority. Other commenters asked whether a 
child who reaches the age of majority can hold a school responsible for 
lost services. One commenter suggested adding a new paragraph to Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) that would grant immunity to an LEA if a child with a 
disability attains the age of majority and seeks to sue the LEA for 
failure to make FAPE available because the child's parent revoked 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services. Another commenter asked whether unilaterally withdrawing a 
child with a disability from special education releases the LEA from 
any liability, past or future, with regard to providing FAPE to the 
child and the remedies available for denial of FAPE.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 615(m)(1) of the Act allows, but does not 
require, a State to transfer all rights accorded to parents under Part 
B of the Act to children who have reached the age of majority under 
State law. If State law grants a child who has reached the age of 
majority under State law (except for a child with a disability who has 
been determined to be incompetent under State law) all rights 
previously granted to parents, then the parents' rights are transferred 
to the child as provided in Sec.  300.520(a), enabling that child to 
revoke consent for special education and related services under Sec.  
300.300(b)(4). However, in accordance with section 615(m)(1) of the Act 
and Sec.  300.520(a)(1)(i), the public agency must provide any notice 
required under Part B of the Act to the child and the parents. 
Therefore, the parents would receive prior written notice, consistent 
with Sec.  300.503, of the public agency's proposal to discontinue 
special education and related services based on receipt of the written 
revocation of consent from a child to whom rights transferred under 
Sec.  300.520(a). This parental notice could facilitate discussion 
between the child and parent of the decision to revoke consent and the 
potential ramifications of that decision.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the comments about a student who reaches the age of 
majority holding a school responsible for loss of Part B services, 
Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(iii) provides that, if the parent of a child 
revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special 
education and related services, the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child because of the failure to provide the child with further 
special education and related services. Therefore, granting the public 
agency immunity is not necessary because the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child if the parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services. Revocation of parental consent releases the LEA from 
liability for providing FAPE from the time the parent revokes consent 
for special education and related services until the time, if any, that 
the child is evaluated and deemed eligible, once again, for special 
education and related services.

Comment: Several commenters stated that the right to FAPE is a 
child's right and allowing parents to revoke consent for special 
education and related services undermines that right.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We do not agree with the commenters that Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) undermines a child's right to FAPE. Section 300.101 
requires that FAPE must be available to all children with disabilities 
residing in a State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, except 
that public agencies are not required to serve children aged 3 through 
5 and aged 18 through 21 if serving such children is inconsistent with 
State law, practice or the order of any court with respect to the 
provision of public education to children of those ages. The child's 
parents, under the Act, are afforded rights regarding the provision of 
FAPE to their child, including the right to determine whether their 
child will receive special education and related services. 
Specifically, under section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and (ii)(II) of the 
Act, a parent has the authority to determine whether a public agency 
may begin to provide special education and related services to their 
child. As discussed previously, it is the Department's position that a 
parent also should have the authority to revoke consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services to their 
child. The Act presumes that parents act in the best interest of their 
child. Therefore, affording a parent the right to consent to the 
initial provision of special education and related services or the 
right to revoke consent, in writing, to the continued provision of 
special education and related services is consistent with the Act and 
does not undermine a child's right to FAPE under Sec.  300.101.

Comment: A few commenters expressed concern about how the 
revocation of consent provisions would affect children who live in 
foster homes, or where guardianship is in dispute. Another commenter 
proposed replacing the words ``the parent'' in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) with 
the words ``each parent'' because when custody of a child is in dispute 
the provision should require that each legally responsible parent 
revoke consent before special education and related services are 
discontinued.

Discussion: Certain provisions in the Part 300 regulations, such as 
the definition of parent in Sec.  300.30 and the requirements regarding 
surrogate parents in Sec.  300.519, ensure that a child with a 
disability has an individual who can act as a parent to make 
educational decisions on behalf of the child. Parent, as defined in 
Sec.  300.30, means a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a 
foster parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual 
obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from 
acting as a parent; a guardian generally authorized to act as the 
child's parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the 
child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); an 
individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent 
(including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the 
child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child's welfare. The definition of parent also 
includes a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with 
Sec.  300.519 and section 639(a)(5) of the Act. The duty to appoint a 
surrogate parent under Sec.  300.519 arises when no parent can be 
identified, the public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate 
a parent, the child is a ward of the State, or the child is an 
unaccompanied homeless youth, as defined in section 725(6) of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434(a)(6)).

The language in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) is consistent with other 
regulatory language concerning parental rights in the Part B

the Act apply to both parents, unless a court order or State law 
specifies otherwise. Therefore, we decline to make the change requested 
by the commenter.

Comment: A few commenters questioned whether a parent may revoke 
consent for the continued provision of some services and not others 
and, therefore, require the public agency to continue to provide only 
those services for which the parent has not revoked consent.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent at any time after 
the initial provision of special education and related services to 
revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services to their child in their entirety. Under Sec.  
300.300(b)(1), parental consent is for the initial provision of special 
education and related services generally, not for a particular service 
or services. Once a public agency receives a parental revocation of 
consent, in writing, for all special education and related services for 
a child and provides prior written notice in accordance with Sec.  
300.503, the public agency must, within a reasonable time, discontinue 
all special education and related services to the child. In this 
circumstance, the public agency may not use the procedures in subpart E 
of these regulations, including the mediation procedures under Sec.  
300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec.  300.507 through 
300.516, to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be 
provided to the child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In situations where a parent disagrees with the provision of a 
particular special education or related service and the parent and 
public agency agree that the child would be provided with FAPE if the 
child did not receive that service, the public agency should remove the 
service from the child's IEP and would not have a basis for using the 
procedures in subpart E to require that the service be provided to the 
child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If, however, the parent and public agency disagree about whether 
the child would be provided with FAPE if the child did not receive a 
particular special education or related service, the parent may use the 
due process procedures in subpart E of these regulations to obtain a 
ruling that the service with which the parent disagrees is not 
appropriate for their child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Additionally, under the regulations in Sec.  300.300(d)(2), States 
are free to create additional parental consent rights, such as 
requiring parental consent for particular services, or allowing parents 
to revoke consent for particular services, but in those cases, the 
State must ensure that each public agency in the State has effective 
procedures to ensure that the parents' exercise of these rights does 
not result in a failure to provide FAPE to the child.

Comment: Some commenters asked how proposed Sec.  300.300(b)(4) 
will affect a school district's adequate yearly progress (AYP) 
reporting under the ESEA and whether children who previously received 
special education and related services would be counted in the special 
education subgroup. The commenters requested clarification as to 
whether the student will remain in the students with disabilities 
subgroup if services are discontinued after school has begun but before 
the State assessment is administered and whether or not the State will 
be required to provide accommodations on assessments to the student. 
Another commenter expressed concern that teachers will be blamed if a 
child fails to succeed after a parent revokes consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services because educators 
are ``liable'' for all students under the ESEA. One commenter expressed 
concern about an LEA's and State's ability to accurately track the 
progress of students with disabilities over time, especially if large 
numbers of parents choose to exercise their right to revoke consent. 
Lastly, another commenter expressed concern that a parent who 
unilaterally withdraws his or her child from special education and 
related services may sue an LEA if a student fails to make progress.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive 
special education and related services, the child is considered a 
general education student and will be considered a general education 
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after 
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State 
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general 
education student who has exited special education for accountability 
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to 
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores 
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the 
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the 
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for 
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a 
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related 
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating 
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the 
State may continue to include the child in the students with 
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two 
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no 
longer be required under the IDEA to provide accommodations that were 
previously included in the child's IEP.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the suggestion that teachers are ``liable'' and will be 
blamed if a child fails to succeed after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services, we disagree. Teachers play a 
critical role in ensuring that all children progress academically 
regardless of whether a child receives special education and related 
services. The majority of children who receive special education and 
related services receive their special education services in the 
general education classroom; therefore, general education teachers have 
a vital role in promoting their educational progress. These general 
education teachers will continue to have an important role in fostering 
the educational progress of all children, regardless of whether they 
receive special education and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We disagree that LEAs and States will not have the ability to 
accurately track the progress of students with disabilities over time. 
LEAs currently track the progress of all students through student 
records, report cards, progress reports, and State assessments. 
Students who no longer receive special education and related services 
due to a parent revoking consent will have their progress tracked in 
the same manner as students who do not receive special education and 
related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Lastly, concerning the comment that a parent who revokes consent 
for special education and related services may sue an LEA if their 
child fails to make progress, Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(iii) states that a public agency will not 
be considered in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to 
the child because of the failure to provide the child with further 
special education and related services based on the parent's revocation 
of consent. Additionally, there is no private right of action under the 
ESEA for a parent to sue an LEA if a child fails to make progress.

Comment: One commenter asked if a teacher is required to provide 
the accommodations listed in a child's IEP in the general education 
environment for any child for whom consent for special education and 
related services is revoked. Another commenter expressed concern that 
the children whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services may not receive needed accommodations and 
modifications thereby compromising the child's success in school and 
perhaps in later life.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent in writing under Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) for the continued provision of special education and 
related services, a teacher is not required to provide the previously 
identified IEP accommodations in the general education environment. 
However, general education teachers often provide classroom 
accommodations for children who do not have IEPs. Nothing in Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) would prevent a general education teacher from providing 
a child whose parent has revoked consent for the continued provision of 
special education and related services with accommodations that are 
available to non-disabled children under relevant State standards.

Comment: A few commenters requested that the Department clarify 
that the right of a parent to revoke consent for special education and 
related services does not relieve the LEA of its obligation under child 
find to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, 
including children whose parents revoke consent for special education 
and related services. Other commenters requested clarification as to 
the time frame that applies for an LEA to comply with the child find 
and service obligations for a child who exits special education without 
the agreement of the IEP Team and whether the child should be referred 
for services each school year. One commenter expressed concern that 
allowing revocation of parental consent would potentially create a 
disincentive for general educators to refer students to special 
education because teachers would be reluctant to repeatedly refer a 
student for special education if a parent previously revoked consent 
for services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The child find provisions in section 612(a)(3) of the 
Act and Sec.  300.111 require each State to have in effect policies and 
procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities residing in 
the State and who are in need of special education and related services 
are identified, located, and evaluated. Children who have previously 
received special education and related services and whose parents 
subsequently revoke consent should not be treated any differently in 
the child find process than any other child, including a child who was 
determined eligible and whose parent refused to provide initial consent 
for services. A parent who previously revoked consent for special 
education and related services may continue to refuse services; 
however, this does not diminish a State's responsibility under Sec.  
300.111 to identify, locate and evaluate a child who is suspected of 
having a disability and being in need of special education and related 
services. A public agency must obtain informed written parental 
consent, consistent with Sec.  300.300(a), before conducting an initial 
evaluation. A parent who previously revoked consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services, like any parent of 
a child suspected of having a disability, may refuse to provide consent 
for an initial evaluation.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Concerning the request for clarification of the child find 
timeline, child find is an ongoing process. The Department expects that 
children whose parents revoke consent will be identified, located and 
offered an evaluation in the same manner as any other child if the 
child is suspected of having a disability and being in need of special 
education and related services. Similarly, we do not agree with the 
commenter that general education teachers will not refer children who 
previously received special education and related services. States are 
required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure effective 
child find. Ensuring that general education teachers make appropriate 
referrals of children suspected of having a disability, which would 
include the referral of children whose parents have previously revoked 
consent for such services, is consistent with this responsibility.

Comment: One commenter requested that Sec.  300.300 be amended to 
specifically state that, for discipline purposes, a public agency will 
not consider the child to be a child with a disability if the parent 
refuses consent, fails to respond to a request for consent, or revokes 
consent for special education and related services. Other commenters 
stated that revocation of consent for special education and related 
services should not impact discipline protections for children whose 
parents have revoked consent because the school has prior knowledge 
that the child is a child with a disability and the child has been 
determined eligible for services. The commenters stated that Sec.  
300.534, consistent with section 615(k)(5) of the Act, applies to 
children not yet determined to be eligible for special education and 
related services who have engaged in behavior in violation of a code of 
student conduct. One commenter expressed concern that subjecting 
previously eligible students to general education discipline procedures 
would leave these students without any education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.534 generally provides protections for 
children not yet determined eligible for special education and related 
services in instances when the public agency is deemed to have 
knowledge that a child is a child with a disability before the behavior 
that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred. However, Sec.  
300.534(c)(1)(ii) states that a public agency is not deemed to have 
knowledge under this section if the parent of the child has refused 
services under the regulations implementing Part B of the Act. When a 
parent revokes consent for special education and related services under 
Sec.  300.300(b), the parent has refused services as described in Sec.  
300.534(c)(1)(ii); therefore, the public agency is not deemed to have 
knowledge that the child is a child with a disability and the child may 
be disciplined as a general education student and is not entitled to 
the Act's discipline protections.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not agree that additional clarification of the discipline 
procedures is needed in Sec.  300.300 or with the comment that 
revocation of consent for special education and related services should 
not affect discipline protections because the school has prior 
knowledge that the child has been determined eligible for services. The 
provisions in Sec.  300.534(c), which mirror the language in section 
615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, are clear that once a parent refuses services 
the public agency will not be deemed to have knowledge that the child 
is a child with a disability and the child will be subject to the same 
disciplinary procedures and timelines applicable to general education 
students.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also disagree that previously eligible students who are subject 
to general education discipline procedures will be left without any 
education. Students who are no longer receiving special education and 
related services due to the revocation of parental consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services will be 
subject to the LEA's discipline procedures without the discipline 
protections provided in the Act. However, students will continue to 
receive the full benefit of education provided by the LEA as long as 
they have not committed any disciplinary violations that affect access 
to education (e.g., violations that result in suspension). We expect 
that parents will consider possible consequences of discipline 
procedures when making the decision to revoke consent for the provision 
of special education and related services.

Comment: One commenter asked whether a school will be able to place 
a student with a disability whose parent has revoked consent for 
special education and related services in a general education classroom 
that is co-taught by a special education teacher. Another commenter 
asked if a child must meet all the statewide assessment and credit 
requirements for graduation applicable to students in the general 
education setting if a parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services when the child is a high school senior.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services under Sec.  300.300(b), the child is a general 
education student. Consequently, the child may be placed in any 
classroom where other general education students are placed. If a child 
whose parent has revoked consent is placed in a classroom that is co-
taught by a general education teacher and a special education teacher, 
then that child is placed in the classroom as a general education 
student and should be treated the same as all other general education 
students in that classroom.

High school graduation requirements are within the purview of each

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of

</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: It is inappropriate for school personnel to encourage a 
parent to revoke consent for special education and related services. If 
school personnel believe a child no longer qualifies as a child with a 
disability, Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations provide 
a process for making that determination. Specifically Sec.  300.305(e), 
consistent with section 614(c)(5) of the Act, requires that an LEA 
evaluate a child before determining that the child is no longer a child 
with a disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in 
question and an LEA believes a child may no longer be eligible for 
special education services. A public agency must follow this long-
standing procedure if the agency believes a child should no longer

enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the

Comment: Some commenters expressed concern that allowing parents to 
revoke consent for special education and related services would result 
in parents pulling their children in and out of special education and 
related services. The commenters noted that pulling children in and out 
of special education and related services would have a negative effect 
on student progress, would cause a loss of instructional time, and 
could affect the provision of FAPE. Other commenters expressed concern 
that parents, who previously revoked consent for services, will ask for 
special education and related services when the child has a discipline 
issue or is at risk of not graduating. A few commenters requested that 
there be a limit to how frequently a parent can revoke consent and then 
subsequently request reinstatement in special education for their 
child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) clarifies that parents have the 
right to withdraw their child from special education and related 
services. After revoking consent for his or her child, a parent always 
maintains the right to subsequently request an initial evaluation to 
determine if the child is a child with a disability who needs special 
education and related services. Nothing in the Act or the implementing 
regulations prevents a parent from requesting an evaluation when their 
child has a discipline issue or is at risk of not succeeding in school. 
This is because, consistent with Sec.  300.101, the public agency has 
an affirmative obligation to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. The child's right to have FAPE available does not cease to 
exist upon the revocation of consent. Therefore, a parent may consider 
discipline and graduation requirements when determining whether to 
request special education and related services for their child.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not agree with the commenter that the Department should limit 
how frequently a parent may revoke consent and then subsequently 
request reinstatement in special education services because retaining 
flexibility to address the unique and individualized circumstances 
surrounding each child's education is important. A public agency will 
not be considered in violation of the obligation to make FAPE available 
to the child for failure to provide the child with further special 
education services following a parent's revocation of consent. We 
understand the commenter's concern that placing a child in and out of 
special education services may affect the provision of FAPE; however, a 
public agency is only responsible for providing FAPE during the time 
period that the parent has provided consent for special education and 
related services.

Comment: One commenter expressed concern about potential staffing 
implications, especially for small school districts that may have hired 
a teacher with unique expertise for a child whose parent subsequently 
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: The Department appreciates that a parent's revocation 
of consent could affect staffing at the school and district levels and 
that there may be instances where staff members are no longer providing 
special education and related services. However, such issues should not 
affect a parent's right to revoke consent for special education and 
related services because a parent's right to determine whether his or 
her child will receive special education and related services is 
paramount.

Comment: Some commenters requested that the Department clarify the 
procedures to be followed when a parent provides consent for special 
education and related services after previously revoking consent (re-
enrollment), including whether re-enrollment would be considered an 
initial evaluation that would trigger the 60-day or other State-imposed 
evaluation timeline. Another commenter expressed concern about the expenditure of resources toward a ``new'' initial evaluation and IEP 
for a student for whom consent for special education and related 
services has been revoked and then granted again.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: If a parent who revoked consent for special education 
and related services later requests that his or her child be re-
enrolled in special education, an LEA must treat this request as a 
request for an initial evaluation under Sec.  300.301 (rather than a 
reevaluation under Sec.  300.303). However, depending on the data 
available, a new evaluation may not always be required. An initial 
evaluation, under Sec.  300.305, requires a review of existing 
evaluation data that includes classroom based, local, or State 
assessments, and classroom based observations by teachers and related 
services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the 
child's parents, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether 
the child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec.  300.8, and 
the educational needs of the child. Therefore, a public agency may not 
always have to expend resources on a ``new'' initial evaluation.

Comment: A few commenters argued that the Department does not have 
the authority to issue regulations that allow a parent to revoke 
consent for special education and related services. One commenter 
argued that there is no statutory language in section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii) 
of the Act that authorizes a parent to revoke consent once services 
have been provided. Other commenters argued that the Department does 
not have the authority to regulate in this manner because doing so 
violates the requirements of section 607 of the Act, which prohibits 
the adoption of any regulation that procedurally or substantively 
lessens the protections provided to children with disabilities as 
embodied in the regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 unless the 
regulation ``reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress in 
legislation.'' These commenters noted that the current regulations 
(i.e., without provisions permitting the parent to revoke consent) are 
designed to safeguard the rights of the child, not the unilateral 
preferences of the parent.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, although 
section 614(a)(1)(D) of the Act does not explicitly state that parents 
have the right to revoke consent for special education and related 
services, the parent's right to revoke consent for special education 
and related services at any time is consistent with the Act's emphasis 
on the role of parents in protecting their child's rights and the 
Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and choice in their 
child's education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also disagree that allowing a parent to revoke consent for the 
provision of special education and related services under Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) procedurally or substantively lessens protections 
provided to children with disabilities as embodied in regulations in 
effect on July 20, 1983. As previously stated in response to other 
comments, a parent is recognized under the Act as the party responsible 
for protecting the child's interest in obtaining appropriate 
educational services. It is the Department's position that the 
protections provided to children with disabilities are enlarged rather 
than lessened by amending the regulations to provide that a parent's 
decision to revoke consent for the continued provision of special 
education and related services cannot be challenged by the public 
agency. Furthermore, the change reflected in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) is 
consistent with the legislative changes made to the Act in 2004, which 
included adding to section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act the 
requirement that parental consent be obtained before the public agency 
begins to provide special education and related services to their 
child. In our view, the better reading of the Act, especially in light 
of the Department's long-standing regulatory definition of ``consent,'' 
which has included the concept that consent can be revoked at any time, 
is that a parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of 
services cannot be challenged by a public agency any more than a 
parent's refusal to provide consent for the initial provision of 
special education and related services can be.

Comment: One commenter suggested that allowing parents to 
discontinue special education and related services without a

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter that allowing a parent 
to revoke consent for special education and related services is 
inconsistent with the requirements in section 614(c)(5) of the Act. 
Section 614(c)(5) of the Act requires that an LEA evaluate a child 
before determining that the child is no longer a child with a 
disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in question and 
the LEA believes the child may no longer be eligible for special 
education services. Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent to revoke 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services and does not trigger an LEA's obligation to conduct an 
evaluation for a child that is receiving services before determining 
that a child is no longer a child with a disability. If a parent 
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services for his or her child, the public agency is not 
determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability as 
contemplated by section 614(c)(5) of the Act and Sec.  300.305(e). 
Instead, the public agency is discontinuing the provision of special 
education and related services pursuant to the decision of the parent 
and there is no obligation for the LEA to evaluate the child.

Comment: Some commenters requested that the final regulations 
provide dispute resolution options for public agencies when a parent 
revokes consent for special education and related services. The 
commenters cited various reasons as to why dispute resolution options 
should be included in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) such as: The ability to 
strike a suitable balance among the interests of the public agency, 
parent, and child with a disability; the need for proposed Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) to be consistent with section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 
Sec.  300.507, providing that a parent or a public agency may file a 
due process complaint on any matter relating to the identification, 
evaluation or educational placement of a child with a disability, or 
the provision of FAPE to the child; and the ability of a public agency 
to determine that a child is no longer a child with a disability.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Lastly, some commenters requested that public agencies be allowed 
to initiate the mediation process when a parent revokes consent, while 
another commenter stated that public agencies should, at least, be able 
to offer mediation and that parents can refuse to participate, at their 
sole discretion.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: While the dispute resolution mechanisms in section 615 
of the Act generally are appropriate to resolve disputes between a 
parent and the public agency, it is the Department's position that they 
are not appropriate when a parent revokes consent for all special 
education and related services. Section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 
Sec.  300.507 allow a parent or public agency to file a due process 
complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, and 
educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of FAPE to the child. However, section 
614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act does not allow an LEA to use the due 
process procedures under section 615 of the Act, including mediation, 
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of 
services. If an LEA cannot use the due process procedures in section 
615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 to override a parent's 
refusal to provide initial consent for services, then an LEA also 
should not be allowed to use these due process procedures to override a 
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of services. 
As discussed throughout this preamble, the Secretary believes that 
protecting the interest of parents to make the decision as to whether 
or not their child receives special education and related services is 
consistent with the intent of the Act.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree that the application of the due process procedures to 
disputes between parents and public agencies generally balances the 
interests of public agencies, parents, and children. However, as 
evidenced by section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act, which prohibits 
LEAs from using the due process procedures under section 615 of the Act 
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of 
services, a public agency's right to use the due process procedures in 
section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 is not absolute. 
Similarly, a public agency should not have the ability to override a 
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of special 
education services and related services.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Moreover, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested that 
allowing a parent to revoke consent will affect a public agency's 
ability to determine that a child is no longer a child with a 
disability. If a public agency believes a child is no longer a child 
with a disability then, as required in Sec.  300.305(e), a public 
agency must evaluate the child before making that determination. If the 
parent disagrees with the eligibility determination, then the parent 
may challenge the decision using the due process procedures in section 
615 of the Act.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Lastly, mediation, pursuant to Sec.  300.506(a), may be used to 
resolve any disputes under Part B of the Act and its implementing 
regulations before a parent revokes consent for the continued provision 
of special education and related services. However, for the same 
reasons that mediation is not allowed when a parent refuses to provide 
initial consent for services, mediation is not appropriate once a 
parent revokes consent for the provision of special education and 
related services.

Comment: One commenter expressed concern that allowing a parent to 
remove their child from special education and related services will 
affect LEAs' and SEAs' ability to meet their State Performance Plans 
(SPP) and the Annual Performance Report (APR) targets for graduation in 
Indicator 1 and the targets for the participation and performance of 
children with disabilities on statewide assessments in Indicator 3. The 
commenter also expressed concern about the potential failure of 
students with disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special 
education and related services to participate fully in post-school 
opportunities, reflected in Indicators 13 and 14, regarding secondary 
transition and post-school outcomes, respectively.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 616(a)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
monitor the States, and the States to monitor LEAs, using quantifiable 
indicators in the following priority areas: The provision of FAPE in 
the LRE; the State's exercise of general supervisory authority; and 
disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special 
education and related services to the extent the representation is the 
result of inappropriate identification. As required by the Act, the 
Secretary established, with broad stakeholder input, 20 indicators. 
States established rigorous targets for each indicator and developed 
activities to improve performance to meet those targets in their SPPs. 
States report to the Department in their APR on their performance in 
meeting their targets.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Generally, if a parent revokes consent for his or her child to 
receive special education and related services, the child is no longer 
required to be included in calculations for children with disabilities 
for indicators in the SPP/APR. States may choose to handle students 
whose parents revoke consent to the continued provision of special 
education and related services in graduation rate calculations for 
purposes of the SPPs/APRs in the same way that they treat other 
students who exit from special education and related services prior to 
graduation. Additionally, students whose parents revoke consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services are no 
longer children with disabilities whose participation in post-school 
opportunities would be tracked by the SPP/APR Indicators 13 and 14.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that teachers and related services providers be included as individuals who can refer a child for an initial evaluation.  A few commenters requested clarification as to whether States can authorize other individuals who are acting on behalf of a public agency (e.g., family court, probation officers, staff from other public agencies) to refer a child for an initial evaluation, and whether individuals responsible for protecting the welfare of a child who are not acting on behalf of an SEA or LEA, such as physicians and social workers, can refer a child for an initial evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614 (a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an SEA, other State agency, or LEA shall conduct a full and individual evaluation of a child before the provision of special education and related services.  In Sec. 300.301(a), we interpret this language as requiring public agencies, as that term is defined in Sec. 300.33, to conduct evaluations, because those are the only agencies in the State responsible for providing FAPE to eligible children.  The same language is used in section 614(a)(1)(B) of the Act to describe the agencies that may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if a child is a child with a disability.  We similarly interpret this language to be referring to the entities that are public agencies under Sec. 300.33.  Therefore, Sec. 300.301(b) states that either a parent or a public agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation.  The language does not include employees of SEAs or LEAs (e.g., teachers and related services providers), unless they are acting for the SEA or LEA, or of other State agencies (e.g., probation officers, social workers, or staff from State agencies that are not public agencies as defined in Sec. 300.33).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The requirements in Sec. 300.301(b) pertain to the initiation of an evaluation under Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.305 and should not be confused with the State's child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 and section 612(a)(3) of the Act.  The child find requirements permit referrals from any source that suspects a child may be eligible for special education and related services.  Child find activities typically involve some sort of screening process to determine whether the child should be referred for a full evaluation to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  Therefore, persons such as employees of the SEA, LEA, or other public agencies responsible for the education of the child may identify children who might need to be referred for an evaluation.  However, it is the parent of a child and the public agency that have the responsibility to initiate the evaluation procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 and section 614 of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that the regulations should clarify that the 60-day timeframe in Sec. 300.301(c) to complete an evaluation does not begin if a parent requests an initial evaluation, the LEA denies the request, and the parent challenges the LEA's decision in a due process hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the regulations already address the commenters' concern.  Section 300.301(b) provides that a parent may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability.  If the public agency agrees to conduct the evaluation, Sec. 300.304(a) requires the public agency to provide notice to the parents, in accordance with Sec. 300.503, that describes any evaluation procedures that the agency proposes to conduct.  The public agency must obtain informed consent for the evaluation, consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.9 and 300.300, prior to conducting the evaluation.  The 60-day timeframe begins when the public agency receives the consent for evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If, however, the public agency does not suspect that the child has a disability and denies the request for an initial evaluation, the public agency must provide written notice to the parents, consistent with Sec. 300.503(b) and section 615(c)(1) of the Act, which explains, among other things, why the public agency refuses to conduct an initial evaluation and the information that was used as the basis to make that decision.  The parent may challenge such a refusal by requesting a due process hearing, but the timeline for conducting the evaluation does not begin prior to parental consent for evaluation.  A parent would not be able to give consent under this part without knowing what specific evaluation procedures the public agency is proposing to conduct.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The regulations are sufficiently clear on this point.  Section 300.503(a), consistent with section 615(b)(3) of the Act, provides that a public agency may refuse to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child, if the public agency provides written notice.  This includes situations in which a public agency wishes to deny a parent's request for an initial evaluation.  The written notice must meet the requirements in Sec. 300.503(b).  Thus, for situations in which a public agency wishes to deny a parent's request for an initial evaluation, the written notice would provide, among other things, an explanation of why the public agency refuses to conduct an initial evaluation and the information that was used to make that decision.

Section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act requires an initial evaluation to be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation or, if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within that timeframe.

A significant number of commenters recommended that if a State establishes its own timeframe within which an evaluation must be conducted, that the timeframe be less, but not more, than 60 days.  Several commenters recommended that if a State has its own timeframe for evaluation, the timeframe should be reasonable and "reasonable" should be defined.  Some commenters recommended that if a State's timeframe is greater than 60 days, the Department should provide guidance to the State and to parents in that State.

The Department declines to require that a State-established timeframe be less than 60 days or to place additional requirements on States with timeframes of greater than 60 days because the Act gives States the authority to establish different timeframes and imposes no restrictions on State exercise of that authority.

One commenter recommended that public agencies provide consent forms to parents promptly after a referral for evaluation has been made so that the child's evaluation is not delayed.  A few commenters asked how promptly an LEA must seek parental consent following a referral for evaluation, and whether an LEA can wait until September to obtain consent if a referral is made in June or July.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We cannot change the timeframe for an initial evaluation specified in section 614(a)(1)(C) of the Act.  Section 614(a)(1)(C) of the Act requires that an initial evaluation be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the timeframe established by the State.  Section 300.323(c) is a longstanding requirement that a meeting be held to develop the child's IEP within 30 days of determining that a child needs special education and related services.  We decline, however, to specify the timeframe from referral for evaluation to parental consent, or the timeframe from the completion of an evaluation to the determination of eligibility, as we are not in a position to determine the maximum number of days that should apply to these periods in all circumstances.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, it has been the Department's longstanding policy that evaluations be conducted within a reasonable period of time following the agency's receipt of parental consent, if the public agency agrees that an initial evaluation is needed to determine whether a child is a child with a disability.  Likewise, the Department believes that eligibility decisions should be made within a reasonable period of time following the completion of an evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The child find requirements in Sec. 300.111 and section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act require that all children with disabilities in the State who are in need of special education and related services be identified, located, and evaluated.  Therefore, it would generally not be acceptable for an LEA to wait several months to conduct an evaluation or to seek parental consent for an initial evaluation if the public agency suspects the child to be a child with a disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If it is determined through the monitoring efforts of the Department or a State that there is a pattern or practice within a particular State or LEA of not conducting evaluations and making eligibility determinations in a timely manner, this could raise questions as to whether the State or LEA is in compliance with the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the total timeframe from referral to IEP development, this will vary based on a number of factors, including the timing of parental consent following referral for an evaluation and whether a State establishes its own timeframe to conduct an initial evaluation.

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended that an initial evaluation be conducted in an expedited timeframe for children who are homeless or in the custody of a child welfare agency.

Discussion:  Congress recognized the unique problems homeless children face and included several new provisions in the Act to ensure that homeless children and youth with disabilities have access to the same services and supports as all other children with disabilities.  The Department recognizes that the high mobility rates of some homeless children with disabilities (as well as other children, including some children who are in the custody of a State child welfare agency) pose unique challenges when a child is referred for an evaluation, but moves to another district or State before an evaluation can be initiated or completed.  In such cases, the Department believes it is important that the evaluations be completed as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the date on which the child was first referred for evaluation in any LEA.  However, the high mobility rate of these children and their potential range of evaluation needs means that any specific expedited timeframe could be both too long to ensure that all children are evaluated before they move, and too short to be reasonable in all circumstances.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from establishing its own policies to address the needs of homeless children, including adopting a timeframe for initial evaluations that is less than 60 days.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters requested clarification regarding whether the 60-day timeframe for initial evaluations could be extended by mutual agreement between the parent and the public agency.  A few commenters asked whether the 60-day timeframe could be extended for reasons other than the exceptions listed in Sec. 300.301(d), and whether a State could include other exceptions in its State policies and procedures.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Congress was clear in limiting the exceptions to the 60-day timeframe to the situations in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in the regulations other exceptions, such as permitting a parent and a public agency to mutually agree to extend the 60-day timeframe or to include exceptions to the timeframe, that would be in addition to those in the Act and listed in Sec. 300.301(d).  However, the Act gives States considerable discretion with a State-adopted timeframe.  A State could adopt a timeframe of 60 days or some other number of days, with additional exceptions.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A number of comments were received requesting clarification on the provision in Sec. 300.301(d)(1), which allows an extension of the 60-day or State-established timeframe to complete an initial evaluation if the parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the child for an evaluation.  A few commenters asked whether the exception applies when a child is not available because of absences on the days the evaluation is scheduled.  Several commenters stated that "produce" does not necessarily mean the child's physical presence in school.  Other commenters requested that the regulations define "repeatedly fails" and "refuses to produce" so that LEAs do not have to engage in exhaustive efforts to obtain access to the child to complete the evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that an LEA must document that it has made several attempts to address the parent's concerns and clarify any confusion the parent may have about the evaluation, as well as address issues that make it difficult for the parent to bring the child to a scheduled evaluation, such as lack of transportation and childcare.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.301(d) follows the specific language in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act.  We do not believe it is appropriate or reasonable to define "repeatedly fails" or "refuses to produce" because the meaning of these phrases will vary depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  For example, situations in which a child is absent on the days the evaluation is scheduled because the child is ill would be treated differently than if a parent repeatedly fails to keep scheduled appointments.  Similarly, situations in which a parent fails to keep scheduled appointments when a public agency repeatedly schedules the evaluation to accommodate the parent's schedule would be treated differently than situations in which a public agency makes no attempt to accommodate a parent's schedule.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to clarify that an LEA must document that it has made several attempts to address a parent's concerns and issues about the evaluation.  As a matter of practice, LEAs attempt to address parent's concerns and issues prior to scheduling an evaluation because repeated cancellations of appointments or repeated failures to produce the child for an evaluation are costly in terms of staff time and effort.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended that there be an exception to the 60-day timeframe when a child transfers to a new school before an evaluation is completed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The exception referred to by the commenters is already in the regulations.  Section 300.301(d)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers to a new school before an evaluation is completed, if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  While the exception to the 60-day timeframe, as stated in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, only applies when a child transfers to a school located in another public agency, we do not believe the language in paragraph (d)(2), as proposed in the NPRM, is necessarily clear on this matter.  We, therefore, have added language in paragraph (d)(2) to provide additional clarity.  We believe it is important that it is understood that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency.  When a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency, we expect that an initial evaluation will be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the State-established timeframe.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language to Sec. 300.301(d)(2) to clarify that the exception to the 60-day or State-established timeframe only applies when a child transfers to a new school located in another public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several comments were received on the provision in new Sec. 300.301(e) (proposed Sec. 300.301(d)(2)(ii)) that allows an exception to the 60-day or State-established timeframe, only if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure a prompt completion of the evaluation and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  One commenter stated that schools would be unable to meet the 60-day timeframe for children who transfer from another public agency if the new public agency has not been notified of the evaluation timeframe.  Another commenter recommended that exceptions to the 60-day timeframe should not be permitted because the term "sufficient progress" is not defined.  A few commenters requested that the regulations define "sufficient progress."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter stated that there might be legitimate reasons for not completing an evaluation within the 60-day timeframe, such as differences in the assessment instruments used in the previous and new public agency, and requested that the regulations provide guidance on how a public agency should determine if appropriate progress is being made.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended that if there is no date certain when an evaluation must be completed when a child transfers public agencies, the new public agency should conduct an evaluation within 60 days of the enrollment date of the child; make reasonable efforts to obtain evaluation information from the previous public agency; and consider any available evaluation information from the previous public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended requiring the new public agency to contact the previous public agency within five days to request a report of any actions taken to transfer the child's records, copies of completed evaluations, a copy of the child's file, and an estimate as to when the information will be sent.  The commenter stated that public agencies should be required to keep records of such attempts to inform parents of all actions through written communication.  The commenter stated that if the information is not received within 15 days, the new public agency should be required to begin a new evaluation and complete it within the 60-day or State established timeframe.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The exceptions to the 60-day or State-established timeframe must be permitted because they are statutory.  Section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, which is incorporated in Sec. 300.300(d)(2), provides that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply if a child enrolls in a school served by the public agency after the relevant timeframe has begun, and prior to a determination by the child's previous public agency as to whether the child is a child with a disability.  The exception applies only if the subsequent public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and subsequent public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to define the phrase "sufficient progress" because the meaning will vary depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  As one commenter noted, there may be legitimate reasons for not completing the evaluation within the 60-day timeframe, such as differences in assessment instruments used in the previous and new public agencies, and the length of time between a child leaving one school and enrolling in the next school.  Therefore, we believe that whether a new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of an evaluation is best left to the discretion of State and local officials and parents to determine.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It would be over-regulating to specify the number of days within which a new public agency must request a child's records from the previous public agency or to require the new public agency to document its attempts to obtain the records and keep parents informed of all actions through written communication.  We note, however, that Sec. 300.304(c)(5), consistent with section 614(b)(3)(D) of the Act, requires each public agency to ensure that the evaluations of children with disabilities who transfer from one school district to another school district in the same school year are coordinated with the children's prior and subsequent schools, as necessary, and as expeditiously as possible, to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Additionally, new Sec. 300.323(g) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(2)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires the new school in which the child enrolls to take reasonable steps to promptly obtain the child's records (including the IEP and supporting documents and any other records relating to the provision of special education or related services to the child) from the previous public agency in which the child was enrolled.  The previous public agency in which the child was enrolled must also take reasonable steps to promptly respond to the request from the new public agency.  We believe that these requirements will help to ensure that a child's records are promptly received by the new public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Act does not require the evaluation of a child who is transferring to a new school to be completed within 60 days of the enrollment date of the child, as recommended by one commenter, and we do not believe that such a requirement should be included in the regulations.  The completion of evaluations for children who transfer to another school are subject to multiple factors and we decline to regulate on a specific timeframe that would apply in all circumstances.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended sanctions against a new public agency that fails to make an effort to complete an evaluation of a child who transfers to another school that was begun by a previous public agency.  The commenter stated that the previous public agency should also be sanctioned for failure to cooperate with a new public agency or for otherwise impeding the ability of the new public agency to complete the evaluation promptly.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As part of its general supervisory responsibilities in Sec. 300.149 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, each SEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of Part B of the Act are followed, including the requirements for children who transfer from one public agency to another public agency within the school year.  Whether sanctions against a particular LEA are appropriate should be determined by the SEA in the first instance, as they are in the best position to determine what sanctions, technical assistance, or combination of the two are likely to lead to future compliance.  For that reason, we decline to regulate with more specificity in this area.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Screening for instructional purposes is not evaluation (Sec. 300.302)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C1866%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification on the difference between screening and evaluation and recommended that the regulations include specific examples of what constitutes screening, including testing instruments that are appropriate to be used for screening to determine appropriate instructional strategies.  Many commenters recommended permitting States to determine the screening process for identifying appropriate instructional strategies.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that "screening" is too loosely defined and may be confused with State regulations that require screening for a child's entrance into school.  The commenter recommended that the regulations address issues such as the need for parental consent prior to screening and a timeframe for screening subsequent to a request.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An "evaluation," as used in the Act, refers to an individual assessment to determine eligibility for special education and related services, consistent with the evaluation procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311.  "Screening," as used in Sec. 300.302 and section 614(a)(1)(E) of the Act, refers to a process that a teacher or specialist uses to determine appropriate instructional strategies.  Screening is typically a relatively simple and quick process that can be used with groups of children.  Because such screening is not considered an evaluation under Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 to determine eligibility for special education services, parental consent is not required.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.302 does not address screening for a child's entrance into school under a State's rules.  Screening required under a State's rules for a child's entrance into school is the responsibility of the State and is not within the purview of the Act.  We believe that the provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, regarding evaluations, and Sec. 300.302, regarding screening for instructional purposes, are clear, and therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to add language to the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We decline to provide specific examples of testing instruments to determine appropriate instructional strategies because this will vary based on the age of the child and the subject matter, and is best left to State and local officials to determine.  Likewise, the process for screening, including the timeframe to complete the screening process, is a decision that is best left to State and local officials to determine, based on the instructional needs of the children.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether the provisions in Sec. 300.302, regarding screening, apply to a child with a disability, as well as a child who has not been identified as a child with a disability.  One commenter noted that Sec. 300.302 refers to screening of a child by a teacher or a specialist and asked who would be considered a specialist.  Another commenter requested clarification regarding the term "instructional strategies for curriculum implementation," as used in Sec. 300.302.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.302, consistent with section 614(a)(1)(E) of the Act, states that the screening of a child by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies is not considered an evaluation for purposes of determining eligibility for special education and related services.  This applies to a child with a disability, as well as a child who has not been identified as a child with a disability.  Such screening, therefore, could occur without obtaining informed parental consent for screening.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe the determination of who is considered a "specialist" should be left to the discretion of the public agency and should not be specified in the regulations.  The term, "instructional strategies for curriculum implementation" is generally used to refer to strategies a teacher may use to more effectively teach children. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that requires a State to, or prohibits a State from, developing and implementing policies that permit screening children to determine if evaluations are necessary.  However, screening may not be used to delay an evaluation for special education and related services.  If a child is referred for an evaluation to determine eligibility for special education and related services, the public agency must implement the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 and adhere to the 60-day or the State-established timeframe to complete the evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Reevaluations (Sec. 300.303)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C1880%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying that a parent is not required to provide a reason for requesting a reevaluation.  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require a public agency to provide prior written notice if a parent requests a reevaluation within a year and the public agency refuses the request.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.303(b), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation may occur if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  There is no requirement that a reason for the reevaluation be given and we agree that a reevaluation cannot be conditioned on the parent providing a reason for requesting a reevaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.303(b), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B) of the Act, provides that a reevaluation may occur not more than once a year and must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise.  If a parent requests more than one reevaluation in a year and the public agency does not believe a reevaluation is needed, we believe the regulations are clear that the public agency must provide the parents with written notice of the agency's refusal to conduct a reevaluation, consistent with Sec. 300.503 and section 615(c)(1) of the Act.  We do not believe additional regulations are necessary to address this specific instance of a public agency's refusal to initiate a reevaluation and the written notice requirements in Sec. 300.503.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested clarification regarding whether an evaluation that assesses skills that were not previously assessed in the same related services area would be considered an evaluation or reevaluation.  One commenter, asked, for example, if a speech-language evaluation was conducted to assess a child's speech impairment one year, would an evaluation the following year to assess the child's language abilities be considered an evaluation or reevaluation?</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An initial evaluation of a child is the first complete assessment of a child to determine if the child has a disability under the Act, and the nature and extent of special education and related services required.  Once a child has been fully evaluated, a decision has been rendered that a child is eligible for services under the Act, and the required services have been determined, any subsequent evaluation of a child would constitute a reevaluation.  In the example provided by the commenter, the second evaluation would be considered a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that reevaluations be required at least once every three years because a child's mental and physical profile changes in three years, and thus, so would the child's educational needs.  Another commenter recommended requiring LEAs to inform parents that information from the most recent evaluation, which could be three or more years old if the parent agrees that a reevaluation is unnecessary, will be used in the development of a child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended an accountability process for LEAs that do not conduct reevaluations at least every three years.  The commenters recommended requiring LEAs to report to the State the number of children with disabilities who qualified for, but were not given a three-year reevaluation; provide prior written notice to parents if the LEA determines that a three-year reevaluation is not necessary, including the justification for such determination; and inform the parent in writing in the parent's language that a three-year reevaluation will be conducted if the parent disagrees with the LEA's determination.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended requiring an LEA that does not conduct a reevaluation at least once every three years to justify the reasons in writing, especially if there is evidence that the child is not meeting the State's academic achievement standards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, requires a reevaluation to occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	It would be overly burdensome to require an LEA to report to the State the number of children with disabilities who qualified for, but were not given a three-year reevaluation.  Similarly, it would be overly burdensome to require LEAs to inform parents that information from the most recent evaluation will be used to develop a child's IEP or to justify to the parent in writing the LEA's reasons for not conducting a reevaluation every three years if the parent and the agency have already agreed that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a parent requests a reevaluation and the public agency disagrees that a reevaluation is needed, the public agency must provide prior written notice to the parent, consistent with Sec. 300.503, that explains, among other things, why the agency refuses to conduct the reevaluation and the parent's right to contest the agency's decision through mediation or a due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In situations where a public agency believes a reevaluation is necessary, but the parent disagrees and refuses consent for a reevaluation, new Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(ii) is clear that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the consent override procedures described in Sec. 300.300(a)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended the following requirements for the reevaluation of a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities who is assessed based on alternate achievement standards:  (a) prohibiting the public agency from automatically determining that a three-year reevaluation is not needed; (b) requiring the public agency to consider whether the child has been correctly identified to be assessed against alternate achievement standards; and (c) requiring a review of evaluation data to determine whether the child is, to the extent possible, being educated in the general curriculum and assessed with instruments aligned with that curriculum.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe changes to the regulations are necessary to address the commenter's concerns.  The Act does not include any special requirements for the reevaluation of a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities who is assessed against alternate achievement standards.  It would be inconsistent with the individualized evaluation and reevaluation procedures in section 614(b) and (c) of the Act for a public agency to automatically determine that reevaluations are unnecessary for a specific group of children.  In determining whether a reevaluation is needed, the parent and the public agency must consider the child's educational needs, which may include whether the child is participating in the general education curriculum and being assessed appropriately.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that parents have the right to prevent the over-testing of their child and that the requirements for reevaluations do not diminish the rights of parents to make decisions regarding the reevaluation.  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require States to establish additional procedural safeguards to ensure that parents who agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary are aware of the implications of their decision.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the requirements for reevaluations in Sec. 300.303 diminish the rights of parents.  As stated in Sec. 300.303, consistent with section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a parent can request a reevaluation at any time, and can agree with the public agency to conduct a reevaluation more frequently than once a year.  Likewise, a parent and a public agency can agree that a reevaluation is not necessary.  We believe that in reaching an agreement that a reevaluation is unnecessary, as provided for in Sec. 300.303(b), the parent and public agency will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of conducting a reevaluation, as well as what effect a reevaluation might have on the child's educational program.  Therefore, we do not agree with the commenter that additional procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure that parents who agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary are aware of the implications of their decision.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested that the opportunity to waive a reevaluation occur only after the IEP Team has reviewed extant data to determine whether additional data are needed to determine the child's eligibility and the educational needs of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The review of existing data is part of the reevaluation process.  Section 300.305(a), consistent with section 614(c)(1) of the Act, is clear that, as part of any reevaluation, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, must review existing evaluation data, and on the basis of that review, and input from the child's parents, identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether the child continues to have a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the opportunity for a parent and the public agency to agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary occurs before a reevaluation begins.  It would be inconsistent with the Act to implement the commenters' recommendation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that waiving a three-year reevaluation must not be adopted as routine agency policy or practice and should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations require the LEA to offer parents a reevaluation at least annually when a parent agrees that a three-year reevaluation is not needed.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that a reevaluation may be warranted more than once a year if the child's condition changes or new information becomes available that has an impact on the child's educational situation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language clarifying that waiving three-year reevaluations must not be a routine agency policy or practice because the regulations are clear that this is a decision that is made individually for each child by the parent of the child and the public agency.  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  When a parent and a public agency agree that a three-year reevaluation is unnecessary, there is no requirement that the public agency offer the parent a reevaluation each year.  We do not believe that it is necessary to have such a requirement because if parents who have waived a three year reevaluation later decide to request an evaluation, they can do so.  Also, public agencies have a continuing responsibility to request parental consent for a reevaluation if they determine that the child's educational or related services needs warrant a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe additional regulations are needed to clarify that a reevaluation can occur more than once a year.  Section 300.303(b)(1), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, already provides that a reevaluation can occur more than once a year if the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is needed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  An agreement between a parent and a public agency is not the same as parental consent in Sec. 300.9.

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that when a parent obtains an independent educational evaluation (IEE) and provides new information to the public agency, a reevaluation could be conducted more than once a year so that the public agency can verify the results of the IEE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The changes recommended by the commenter are unnecessary.  Section 300.303(b)(1), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, is clear that a reevaluation can be conducted more than once a year if the parent and the public agency agree that it is necessary.  Therefore, in the situation presented by the commenter, if the results of an IEE provide new information that the public agency and the parent agree warrant a reevaluation, the parent and the public agency could agree to conduct a reevaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the requirement for prior written notice to parents in Sec. 300.304(a) is satisfied if the public agency notifies the parent of the type(s) of assessment(s) that will be conducted.  One commenter stated that the prior written notice requirements for evaluations should be satisfied if the public agency notifies the parent of the type(s) of assessment(s) that will be conducted, the method(s) of assessment, and the persons who will conduct the assessment(s).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inconsistent with the Act for a public agency to limit the contents of the prior written notice in the manner requested by the commenters.  In addition to describing the evaluation procedures the agency proposes to use, as required in Sec. 300.303(a), section 615(c)(1) of the Act requires the prior written notice to include an explanation of why the agency proposes to evaluate the child; a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for requesting the evaluation; a statement that the parents have protection under the procedural safeguards of the Act, and if this notice is not an initial referral for evaluation, the means by which a copy of the procedural safeguards can be obtained; sources for the parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions of the Act; a description of other options that were considered and why these reasons were rejected; and a description of other factors that are relevant to the agency's proposal to request consent for an evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether the "procedure" referred to in Sec. 300.304(b)(2) is the same as the "measure or assessment" referred to in section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act.

Discussion:  Section 300.304(b)(2), as proposed, states that the public agency may not use any single "procedure" as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability and for determining an appropriate educational program for the child.  Section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act states that in conducting an evaluation, the LEA must not use any single "measure or assessment" as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for the child.  We agree that the statutory language should be used in Sec. 300.304(b)(2) because use of the term "procedure," rather than "measurement or assessment," could be confusing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Adding the word "always" to Sec. 300.304(b) would not change the requirements for conducting an evaluation consistent with Sec. 300.304(b).  The regulation already requires a public agency to conduct the evaluation in accordance with Sec. 300.304(b)(1) through (b)(3) and there are no exceptions to that requirement.

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations define "technically sound instruments" and "relative contribution" in Sec. 300.304(b)(3).  Another commenter recommended that the instruments used in reevaluations to determine whether the child continues to have a disability should be based on scientific research methods.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(b)(3) follows the specific language in section 614(b)(2)(C) of the Act and requires that the evaluation of a child use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical and developmental factors.  "Technically sound instruments" generally refers to assessments that have been shown through research to be valid and reliable.  Therefore, it would be redundant to add language requiring that instruments used in reevaluations be based on scientific research methods, as recommended by one commenter.  The phrase "relative contribution," as used in Sec. 300.304(b)(3), generally means that assessment instruments that allow the examiner to determine the extent to which a child's behavior is a result of cognitive, behavioral, physical, or developmental factors may be used in evaluating a child in accordance with Sec. 300.304.  Because the meaning of "relative contribution" is context specific, we do not believe it should be defined in these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe that the clarification requested by the commenter is necessary.  The Act and these regulations recognize that some assessments may be biased and discriminatory for children with differences in language and socialization practices.  Section 614(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act requires that assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under the Act are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis.  Additionally, in interpreting evaluation data for the purpose of determining eligibility of a child for special education and related services, Sec. 300.306(c) requires each public agency to draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent input, teacher recommendations, as well as information regarding a child's physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior.  We believe that these provisions provide adequate protection for the concerns raised by the commenter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that a public agency should not use the "not clearly feasible" exception in Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(ii) to improperly limit a child's right to be evaluated in the child's native language or other mode of communication.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(c)(1)(ii), consistent with section 614(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, requires that assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child be provided and administered in the child's native language or other mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do, unless it is clearly not feasible to so provide or administer.  We agree that this provision should not be improperly used to limit evaluations in a child's native language, but we do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary or that it would prevent inappropriate application of the existing rule.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

This is not an exhaustive list of areas that must be assessed.  Decisions regarding the areas to be assessed are determined by the suspected needs of the child.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the evaluation report include a description of the extent to which an assessment varied from standard conditions because there are few assessments that produce valid and reliable information for English language learners suspected of having a disability.  Several commenters stated that it is standard practice for professionals administering assessments to include information in their reports when assessments are conducted using nonstandard conditions.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require all evaluation reports to clearly indicate the language or other mode of communication used in assessing a child and a determination of whether using such language or other mode of communication yielded accurate information.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As stated by several commenters, it is standard test administration practice to include in the evaluation report the extent to which an assessment varied from standard conditions, including the language or other mode of communication that was used in assessing a child.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations require public agencies to provide parents with evidence that the assessments to be used are reliable and valid for their particular use, as well as assurances that the assessments will be administered in the child's primary language or mode of communication.

To require public agencies to provide all parents with the specific information recommended by the commenters would be burdensome for public agencies, and could be overwhelming for some parents, and therefore, we decline to add such a requirement to the regulations.

In addition, Sec. 300.306(b), consistent with section 614(b)(5) of the Act, states that a child must not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math, or limited English proficiency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, states that one of the purposes of a reevaluation is to determine the educational needs of the child, including whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the child's IEP goals and to participate in the general education curriculum.  Thus, if a reevaluation is requested to determine the child's educational needs when the child's continued eligibility is not in question, the public agency must either conduct the reevaluation or provide notice to the parents as to why the public agency believes a reevaluation is unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The phrase, "qualified professionals, as appropriate" is used to provide flexibility for public agencies to include other professionals who may not be a part of the child's IEP Team in the group that determines if additional data are needed to make an eligibility determination and determine the child's educational needs.

Comment:  One commenter stated that the heading for Sec. 300.305(e), "Evaluations before change in placement" should be changed because the regulations that follow do not deal with changes in placement.  Another commenter requested clarification regarding the meaning of the term "placement."  The commenter stated that Sec. 300.305(e) uses the term to mean that special education services are no longer required, but that this is not the meaning when used in the context of alternative educational placements.  The commenter also asked whether moving a child from a self-contained classroom to a resource room is a change of placement. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the heading for Sec. 300.305(e) should be changed to more accurately reflect the requirements in this subsection.  We will, therefore, change the heading to "Evaluations before change in eligibility," which is consistent with the heading in section 614(c)(5) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the commenter's question about whether moving a child from a self-contained classroom to a resource room would be a change of placement, we believe that it would be, as it would change the child's level of interaction with his or her nondisabled peers.  However, as noted previously, the term "change of placement" should not have been used in connection this regulation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In the example provided by the commenter, generally, if a child is moved from a self-contained classroom to a resource room, it is likely that the child's current IEP cannot be implemented in the resource room, because the educational program in the resource room is likely to be substantially and materially different than the educational program in the self-contained classroom or the educational program in the resource room would change the level of interaction with nondisabled peers.  Therefore, this situation would likely be a change of placement under the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the heading "Evaluations before change in placement" in Sec. 300.305(e) and replaced it with "Evaluations before change in eligibility" for clarity and consistency with the heading in section 614(c)(5) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended that evaluations for other institutions (e.g., vocational rehabilitation agencies, colleges and universities) should be required before a child graduates from secondary school with a regular diploma or exceeds the age limit for FAPE.  However, a number of commenters disagreed and stated that public agencies should not be required to conduct evaluations that will be used to meet the entrance or eligibility requirements of another institution or agency.  One commenter requested clarification regarding whether schools must provide updated evaluations for college testing and admissions purposes and recommended including language in the regulations that explicitly states that public agencies are not required to conduct tests that are needed for admission to postsecondary programs.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that LEAs have responsibility for providing the postsecondary services that are included in the summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

	A number of commenters provided recommendations on the information that should be included in the summary of a child's academic and functional performance required in Sec. 300.305(e)(3).  Commenters suggested that the summary report should include information about the child's disability; the effect of the disability on the child's academic and functional performance (sufficient to establish eligibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, if appropriate); any needed modifications or adaptations essential to the child's success; the child's most recent evaluations by professionals, including the child's academic achievement and functional performance levels; assistive technology and other supports used by the child; and any modifications and supports that would facilitate the child's successful transition to postsecondary education or employment.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the regulations should require public agencies to conduct evaluations for children to meet the entrance or eligibility requirements of another institution or agency because to do so would impose a significant cost on public agencies that is not required by the Act.  While the requirements for secondary transition are intended to help parents and schools assist children with disabilities transition beyond high school, section 614(c)(5) in the Act does not require a public agency to assess a child with a disability to determine the child's eligibility to be considered a child with a disability in another agency, such as a vocational rehabilitation program, or a college or other postsecondary setting.  The Act also does not require LEAs to provide the postsecondary services that may be included in the summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance.  We believe it would impose costs on public agencies not contemplated by the Act to include such requirements in the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It would be inconsistent with the Act to require public agencies to conduct evaluations for children who are exiting the school system because they exceed the age for eligibility under State law.  Section 300.305(e)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(5)(B)(i) of the Act, is clear that an evaluation in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311 is not required before the termination of a child's eligibility under the Act due to graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma or due to exceeding the age eligibility for FAPE under State law.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The Act does not otherwise specify the information that must be included in the summary and we do not believe that the regulations should include a list of required information.  Rather, we believe that State and local officials should have the flexibility to determine the appropriate content in a child's summary, based on the child's individual needs and postsecondary goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.305(e)(2) specifically states that a public agency does not need to evaluate a child with a disability who graduates with a regular diploma.  In addition, as noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, we have clarified in Sec. 300.101(a)(3)(iv) that a regular diploma does not include alternate degrees, such as a general educational development (GED) credential.  We do not believe that any further clarification with respect to the definition of "regular diploma" is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require public agencies to provide parents with copies of all evaluations at no cost.  However, another commenter stated that evaluations are often lengthy and requested clarification as to whether public agencies must provide copies of evaluations to parents at no cost.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.306(a)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(4)(B) of the Act, requires that a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility be given to the parent.  We have added language to Sec. 300.306(a)(2) to clarify that the public agency must provide these copies at no cost to the parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to providing parents with copies of all evaluations, Sec. 300.501(a), consistent with section 615(b)(1) of the Act, affords parents an opportunity to inspect and review all education records with respect to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child, and the provision of a FAPE to the child.  Specific procedures for access to records are contained in the confidentiality provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.613 requires a public agency to permit a parent to inspect and review any education records relating to their child that are collected, maintained, or used by the agency under the Act.  The right to inspect and review records includes the right to a response from the agency to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of the records; the right to request that the agency provide copies of the records containing the information if failure to provide those copies would effectively prevent the parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the records; and the right to have a representative of the parent inspect and review the records.  To the extent that the commenters may have been concerned about free copies of evaluation documents that would not be provided under the above regulations, we decline to regulate further, as we believe that the cited provisions adequately balance the interests of the parents for free copies and the public agencies in controlling costs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that parents receive evaluation reports prior to an IEP Team meeting because the reports may have information that parents need to participate in making decisions about the IEP.  The commenter stated that, if parents receive reports at meetings, rather than before the meetings, they cannot be active participants.  Another commenter stated that parents should be provided with copies of documents related to the determination of eligibility at least five days prior to the eligibility determination meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not establish a timeline for providing a copy of the evaluation report or the documentation of determination of eligibility to the parents and we do not believe that a specific timeline should be included in the regulations because this is a matter that is best left to State and local discretion.  It is, however, important to ensure that parents have the information they need to participate meaningfully in IEP Team meetings, which may include reviewing their child's records.  Section 300.613(a) requires a public agency to comply with a parent request to inspect and review existing education records, including an evaluation report, without unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IEP, and in no case more than 45 days after the request has been made.  This includes the right to a response from the public agency to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of records, consistent with Sec. 300.613(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	While it would be appropriate for parents to review documents related to the determination of eligibility prior to the eligibility determination, there is no requirement that eligibility be determined at an IEP Team meeting and it would not be appropriate for a public agency to provide documentation of the determination of eligibility prior to discussing a child's eligibility for special education and related services with the parent.  Section 300.306(a)(1) and section 614(b)(4)(A) of the Act require that a group of qualified professionals and the parent determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  Therefore, providing documentation of the eligibility determination to a parent prior to a discussion with the parent regarding the child's eligibility would indicate that the public agency made its determination without including the parent and possibly, qualified professionals, in the decision.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A number of commenters recommended other factors that should be ruled out before a child is determined to be a child with a disability.  Many commenters stated that a child should not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of instruction in English language development or lack of access to State content standards.  A few commenters expressed concern regarding subjective judgments about the definition of "appropriate instruction."  One commenter stated that determining the quality of reading instruction that children received in the past might be difficult, if not impossible, especially when children are referred for an evaluation after they enter middle school or are highly mobile.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that a child should not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of access to State content standards, and we believe this is implicit in section 614(b)(5) of the Act, which states that a child must not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading (including the essential components of reading instruction, as defined in the ESEA) or lack of instruction in math.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
During the Department's internal review of these regulations, we noted that, while Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) refers to lack of "appropriate" instruction in reading, there is no similar qualifier for math.  We believe it is equally important that a child not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor is the lack of "appropriate" instruction in math.  Therefore, we will revise Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(ii) to make this clear.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are unclear what the commenter means by lack of instruction in English language development.  However, if a child's low achievement is a result of limited English proficiency or lack of access to instruction in reading, the child must not be determined to be a child with a disability, consistent with section 614(b)(5) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Whether a child has received "appropriate instruction" is appropriately left to State and local officials to determine.  While information regarding the quality of instruction a child received in the past may be helpful in determining whether a child is eligible for special education services, it is not essential.  Schools, however, must ensure that the determinant factor in deciding that a child is a child with a disability is not a lack of appropriate instruction in reading and math. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters supported proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1), which allowed States to prohibit LEAs from using a severe discrepancy between IQ and achievement (discrepancy models) to determine eligibility under the specific learning disability (SLD) category.  However, many commenters supported the use of discrepancy models and requested that the regulations allow discrepancy models to continue to be used.  Numerous commenters stated that Sec. 300.307(a)(1) exceeds statutory authority and that LEAs should be permitted to use discrepancy models.  Many commenters cited Conf. Rpt. 108-779 and stated that Congress did not intend to prohibit LEAs from using discrepancy models.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department agrees that proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1) should be removed.  We believe this will improve the clarity of the regulations and make it easier for parents and professionals to understand.  With respect to permitting LEAs to use discrepancy models, even with the removal of Sec. 300.307(a)(1), States are responsible for developing criteria to determine whether a child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8 and section 602(3) of the Act, including whether a particular child meets the criteria for having an SLD.  Under section 614(b)(6) of the Act, States are free to prohibit the use of a discrepancy model.  States, including States that did not use a discrepancy model prior to the Act, are not required to develop criteria that permit the use of a discrepancy model.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed Sec. 300.307(a)(1) and redesignated the subsequent provisions in Sec. 300.307.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters stated that response to intervention (RTI) should be considered one component of the evaluation process and not the sole component.  Another commenter stated that neither a discrepancy model nor an RTI model alone can correctly identify children with SLD and that other data are needed, such as informal and formal assessments, histories, and observations.  One commenter stated that all relevant and available evaluation data, such as the nature and type of evaluation, evaluator qualifications, and outcome data should be considered.  One commenter recommended that RTI be tied to the general evaluation procedures.  Another commenter recommended referencing the evaluation procedures in Sec. 300.309 to clarify that RTI must be used as one component of the evaluation process to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  Several commenters stated that relying solely on an RTI model would result in larger numbers of children being identified with an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consistent with Sec. 300.304(b) and section 614(b)(2) of the Act, the evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability, including an SLD, must include a variety of assessment tools and strategies and cannot rely on any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining eligibility for special education and related services.  This requirement applies to all children suspected of having a disability, including those suspected of having an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
To simplify new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) and remove unnecessary repetition, we will:  (a) remove the phrase "as part of the evaluation procedures described in Sec. 300.304;" and (b) replace "process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention" with "process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention."  Section 300.311(a)(7) will also be revised, consistent with this language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended changing new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) to require that State criteria "may" rather than "must" permit a process that determines if a child responds to research-based intervention in order to be consistent with section 614(b)(6)(B) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Making the requested change to new Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) would be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 614(b)(6)(B) of the Act gives LEAs the option of using a process that determines if a child responds to research-based interventions.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations include a statement that discrepancy models have been discredited and that there is no evidence that they can be applied in a valid and reliable manner.  Several commenters recommended that the Department urge States, at least through guidance, to eliminate provisions under State laws that permit the use of discrepancy models.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to add language in the regulations discouraging the use of discrepancy models to identify children with SLD.  We removed current Sec. 300.541(a)(2), which required States to use a discrepancy model to determine whether a child has an SLD, because section 614(b)(6) of the Act now specifies that an LEA shall not be required to consider a severe discrepancy in determining whether a child has an SLD.  New Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) requires States to permit the use of a process that examines whether the child responds to scientific, research-based interventions as part of the information reviewed to determine whether a child has an SLD.  The regulations reflect the Department's position on the identification of children with SLD and our support for models that focus on assessments that are related to instruction and promote intervention for identified children.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that any guidance the Department issues on RTI models should emphasize that RTI represents a shift in how children are identified for special education services and not just an additional task that special education teachers must do. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consensus reports and empirical syntheses indicate a need for major changes in the approach to identifying children with SLD.  Models that incorporate RTI represent a shift in special education toward goals of better achievement and improved behavioral outcomes for children with SLD because the children who are identified under such models are most likely to require special education and related services.  We will consider addressing this issue in future guidance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Discrepancy models are not essential for identifying children with SLD who are gifted.  However, the regulations clearly allow discrepancies in achievement domains, typical of children with SLD who are gifted, to be used to identify children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters opposed the use of RTI models to determine whether a child has an SLD, stating that there is a lack of scientific evidence demonstrating that RTI models correctly identify children with SLD.  One commenter stated that RTI is a subjective method of determining whether treatment is effective and is not a treatment itself.  A few commenters requested additional research demonstrating the efficacy of the wide-scale use of RTI models.  Some commenters stated that research on the use of RTI models has been conducted only in the area of reading in the primary grades and pointed to the lack of scientific data on achievement gains or long-term success.  One commenter stated that there is no evidence that RTI is effective for non-native speakers of English and minority populations.  Another commenter stated that RTI would fail to identify young children with SLD.  One commenter stated that when a child fails to respond to an intervention, it is unclear why the child failed (e.g., inappropriate intervention, ineffective teaching, unreasonable expectations).  One commenter stated that longitudinal data are needed to determine if children who succeed in an RTI process later become eligible under the category of SLD based on reading fluency and comprehension difficulties, or difficulties in other academic areas, such as mathematics problem-solving or written expression.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act requires that LEAs be permitted to use a process that determines if a child responds to research-based interventions.  Further, there is an evidence base to support the use of RTI models to identify children with SLD on a wide scale, including young children and children from minority backgrounds.  These include several large-scale implementations in Iowa (the Heartland model; Tilly, 2002); the Minneapolis public schools (Marston, 2003); applications of the Screening to Enhance Equitable Placement (STEEP) model in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arizona (VanDerHeyden, Witt, and Gilbertson, in press); and other examples (NASDE, 2005).1  While it is true that much of the research on RTI models has been conducted in the area of reading, 80 to 90 percent of children with SLD experience reading problems.  The implementation of RTI in practice, however, has included other domains.  RTI is only one component of the process to identify children in need of special education and related services.  Determining why a child has not responded to research-based interventions requires a comprehensive evaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about how LEAs will conduct evaluations for children suspected of having an SLD who attend private schools because requiring an RTI process could become entangled with the private school's instructional practices.  The commenter recommended clarifying that child find does not require an LEA to use RTI to identify children with SLD who are attending private schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation.  A public agency must use a variety of data gathering tools and strategies even if an RTI process is used.  The results of an RTI process may be one component of the information reviewed as part of the evaluation procedures required under Sec. Sec. 300.304 and 300.305.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b), consistent with section 614(b)(2) of the Act, an evaluation must include a variety of assessment tools and strategies and cannot rely on any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining eligibility for special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that adoption of new procedures for evaluating children suspected of having an SLD should not penalize or declassify children who under prior procedures were found to have an SLD.  The commenter recommended using the requirements in Sec. 300.305, rather than data from a child's response to a scientific, research-based intervention process, to consider whether a child continues to have an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The results of an RTI process may be one component of the information reviewed as part of the reevaluation process.  It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child continues to have a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
States that change their eligibility criteria for SLD may want to carefully consider the reevaluation of children found eligible for special education services using prior procedures.  States should consider the effect of exiting a child from special education who has received special education and related services for many years and how the removal of such supports will affect the child's educational progress, particularly for a child who is in the final year(s) of high school.  Obviously, the group should consider whether the child's instruction and overall special education program have been appropriate as part of this process.  If the special education instruction has been appropriate and the child has not been able to exit special education, this would be strong evidence that the child's eligibility needs to be maintained.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.307(a)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(4)) recognizes that there are alternative models to identify children with SLD that are based on sound scientific research and gives States flexibility to use these models.  For example, a State could choose to identify children based on absolute low achievement and consideration of exclusionary factors as one criterion for eligibility.  Other alternatives might combine features of different models for identification.  We believe the evaluation procedures in section 614(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Act give the Department the flexibility to allow States to use alternative, research-based procedures for determining whether a child has an SLD and is eligible for special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department does not support the use of identification procedures that are not based on scientific research.

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern about allowing States to decide on the approach to determining whether a child has an SLD, and requested the Department develop criteria to be used across the nation.  However, numerous commenters supported the development of State criteria and requiring public agencies to use the State criteria to determine whether a child has an SLD.  Many commenters stated that this requirement is necessary to prevent inconsistent eligibility requirements among LEAs in a State.  Other commenters stated that the requirement exceeds statutory authority and that LEAs should be allowed to make decisions about the criteria and methods to identify children with SLD. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department believes that eligibility criteria must be consistent across a State to avoid confusion among parents and school district personnel.  The Department also believes that requiring LEAs to use State criteria for identifying children with disabilities is consistent with the State's responsibility under section 612(a)(3) of the Act to locate, identify, and evaluate all eligible children with disabilities in the State.  We believe this provides the Department with the authority to require a public agency to use State criteria in determining whether a child has an SLD, consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested requiring States to adopt and implement only one model to determine whether a child has an SLD.  However, several commenters requested that States and LEAs have the flexibility to use more than one model.  One commenter noted that States need flexibility to determine eligibility criteria until there is greater understanding of the effectiveness of evidence-based protocols in identifying children with SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that would require a State to use one model of identification to identify a child with an SLD.

Group members (Sec. 300.308)  <a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2075%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested an explanation of the use of "group members" rather than "team members" to describe the group that determines whether a child suspected of having an SLD is a child with a disability.  One commenter stated that the eligibility determination is an IEP Team function and, therefore, using the term "group members" is inappropriate.  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.308 is confusing because the group seems to be the same as the IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The change from "team members" to "group members" was made in the 1999 regulations to distinguish this group from the IEP Team, because the team of qualified professionals and the parent in Sec. 300.306(a)(1) that makes the eligibility determination does not necessarily have the same members as an IEP Team.  In some States, this group of professionals may have the same individuals as the IEP Team, but in other States, this is not the case.  We inadvertently referred to "team members" in 300.309(a)(2)(ii) and, therefore, will change this to "group."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed "team members" to "group" in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) to be consistent with Sec. 300.306(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that the requirements for the qualifications of the group members in proposed Sec. 300.308(a) are unnecessary and should be removed because they are not included in the Act, are overly prescriptive, and add another set of procedural requirements.  On the other hand, a number of commenters recommended additional or different qualifications that should be required of the group members in Sec. 300.308.  Several commenters recommended that the group members be qualified to conduct assessments in the area of "cognition" rather than "intellectual development" to ensure that specific cognitive abilities are assessed, rather than global intellectual abilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters recommended that proposed Sec. 300.308(a)(2), requiring group members to apply "critical analysis" to the data, be changed to require group members to apply "clinical" analysis to the data.  One commenter stated that clinical analysis should be defined and suggested a definition that includes professional judgment informed by empirical research, training, and experience, and guided by interpretation of patterns in evaluation findings from a number of sources (e.g., test scores; interviews; work samples; observational data; and information from parents, school personnel, and other related services providers).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended requiring evaluations to be completed by certified speech-language pathologists and school psychologists to ensure that qualified professionals conduct the assessments.  One commenter recommended that the examples of the areas for diagnostic assessments be preceded by "such as" to avoid a misinterpretation that a speech-language pathologist, for example, is mandated to participate in every SLD determination.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters agreed with the professional competencies for the group members described in Sec. 300.308(a).  However, one commenter stated that "collectively qualified" is too broad a term and should be more narrowly defined.  Another commenter stated that there is no way to ensure that the group members possess the necessary expertise unless there is a mechanism to determine whether the group members have the specified competencies in proposed Sec. 300.308(a).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter stated that, although professionals from more than one discipline may be qualified to administer certain assessments, they do not bring the same expertise to the process.  One commenter asked if a special education teacher, a regular education teacher, and parent were all that would be necessary if they collectively met the competency requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters stated that the list of professionals in proposed Sec. 300.308(b) for the eligibility group should be removed and decisions about group members left to schools and districts.  Other commenters stated that the requirements for the eligibility group should be the same as those for the group that determines the eligibility of children suspected of all other disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Many commenters recommended that additional or different professionals should be included in the group.  Numerous commenters recommended including speech-language pathologists in the group because of their expertise in reading and conducting individual diagnostic assessments in the areas of speech and language.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters stated that a school psychologist should be a required member of the group, rather than listed as "if appropriate."  One of these commenters stated that, even if school psychologists are no longer required to administer assessments to determine whether there is a discrepancy between the child's achievement and ability, school psychologists conduct assessments related to cognitive functioning, behavior, and other issues that may affect a child's learning. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerous commenters recommended requiring the special education teacher who is part of the eligibility group to have expertise in the area of SLD.  However, one commenter stated that it is unnecessary for a special education teacher to be part of the group because the teacher would not have any instructional experience with the yet-to-be identified child and nothing in the Act requires special education teachers to possess any diagnostic expertise in the area of SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that the group include a teacher with experience in teaching children who are failing or at-risk for failing, in addition to a general education and special education teacher.  Several commenters recommended adding a reading specialist as a required member.  A few commenters recommended including a social worker as a required member, stating that it is important that one of the members examine the child's home and community environment to rule out environmental and economic factors as a primary source of the child's learning difficulties.  Another commenter recommended adding a guidance counselor as a required member.  One commenter recommended including a school nurse and stated that a school nurse can contribute information about educationally relevant medical findings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that a reading teacher and an educational therapist should always be included in the group.  A few commenters were not familiar with the role of an educational therapist and requested a definition or elimination of the term from the list of "other professionals."  One commenter stated that two of the three professionals listed as "other professionals" (school psychologist, reading teacher, educational therapist) are not credentialed and questioned why they were included in the group.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended adding the concept of psychological processing disorders to the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.  Several commenters noted that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not fully address the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), which includes a processing disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes.  Several commenters stated that, without requiring documentation of a basic psychological processing disorder, the number of children identified with SLD will significantly increase and the use of assessment tools that have the potential to significantly guide instruction will decrease.  Several commenters stated that failure to consider individual differences in cognitive processing skills reverses more than 20 years of progress in cognitive psychology and developmental neuroscience.  One commenter stated that identifying a basic psychological processing disorder would help ensure that children identified with an SLD are not simply victims of poor instruction.  One commenter stated that the shift away from requiring diagnostic assessments in the area of cognition would make it conceptually impossible to document that a child has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes, as required in the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department does not believe that an assessment of psychological or cognitive processing should be required in determining whether a child has an SLD.  There is no current evidence that such assessments are necessary or sufficient for identifying SLD.  Further, in many cases, these assessments have not been used to make appropriate intervention decisions.  However, Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits, but does not require, consideration of a pattern of strengths or weaknesses, or both, relative to intellectual development, if the evaluation group considers that information relevant to an identification of SLD.  In many cases, though, assessments of cognitive processes simply add to the testing burden and do not contribute to interventions.  As summarized in the research consensus from the OSEP Learning Disability Summit (Bradley, Danielson, and Hallahan, 2002), "Although processing deficits have been linked to some SLD (e.g., phonological processing and reading), direct links with other processes have not been established.  Currently, available methods for measuring many processing difficulties are inadequate.  Therefore, systematically measuring processing difficulties and their link to treatment is not yet feasible....Processing deficits should be eliminated from the criteria for classification...." (p. 797).3  Concerns about the absence of evidence for relations of cognitive discrepancy and SLD for identification go back to Bijou (1942;4 see Kavale, 2002)5.  Cronbach (1957)6 characterized the search for aptitude by treatment interactions as a "hall of mirrors," a situation that has not improved over the past few years as different approaches to assessment of cognitive processes have emerged (Fletcher et al., 2005; Reschly and Tilly, 1999)7.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to define "intellectual development" in these regulations.  Intellectual development is included in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) as one of three standards of comparison, along with age and State-approved grade-level standards.  The reference to "intellectual development" in this provision means that the child exhibits a pattern on strengths and weaknesses in performance relative to a standard of intellectual development such as commonly measured by IQ tests.  Use of the term is consistent with the discretion provided in the Act in allowing the continued use of discrepancy models. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  As indicated above, an assessment of intra-individual differences in cognitive functions does not contribute to identification and intervention decisions for children suspected of having an SLD.

Comment:  Several commenters expressed support for the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and stated that the first element of determining eligibility for an SLD is a finding that the child does not achieve commensurate with the child's age in one or more of the eight areas when provided with learning experiences appropriate to the child's age.  However, several commenters requested requiring that eligibility determinations for an SLD include evidence that the child's achievement level is not commensurate with the child's age and ability (emphasis added).  One commenter indicated that knowledge of a child's ability level is important to ensure that a determination is not based on deficits in areas not related to cognitive processing (e.g., lack of opportunity to learn, social or emotional disturbances), and to prevent misdiagnosis of children with mental retardation and SLD.  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.309(a)(1) would allow any child who failed to achieve commensurate with his or her age to be considered to have an SLD, and this will increase the number of children referred for special education and related services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters expressed concern that the eligibility determination for SLD is based on whether the child achieves commensurate with his or her age because current practice uses normative data that are based on grade level.  These commenters recommended clarifying that grade level or classmate performance should also be considered.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The first element in identifying a child with SLD should be a child's mastery of grade-level content appropriate for the child's age or in relation to State-approved grade-level standards, not abilities.  This emphasis is consistent with the focus in the ESEA on the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards for all children.  State-approved standards are not expressed as "norms" but represent benchmarks for all children at each grade level.  The performance of classmates and peers is not an appropriate standard if most children in a class or school are not meeting State-approved standards.  Furthermore, using grade-based normative data to make this determination is generally not appropriate for children who have not been permitted to progress to the next academic grade or are otherwise older than their peers.  Such a practice may give the illusion of average rates of learning when the child's rate of learning has been below average, resulting in retention.  A focus on expectations relative to abilities or classmates simply dilutes expectations for children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We will modify Sec. 300.309(a)(1) to clarify that, as a first element in determining whether a child has an SLD, the group must determine that the child does not demonstrate achievement that is adequate for the child's age or the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas listed in Sec. 300.309(a)(1).  The reference to "State-approved grade-level standards" is intended to emphasize the alignment of the Act and the ESEA, as well as to cover children who have been retained in a grade, since age level expectations may not be appropriate for these children.  The reference to "instruction" will be added to emphasize that children may not be identified as having SLD if there is no documentation of appropriate instruction, consistent with the Act and the ESEA.  Consistent with this change, we will add a reference to "State-approved grade-level standards" in Sec. Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii).  We will also combine proposed Sec. 300.311(a)(5) and (6) into Sec. 300.311(a)(5) to ensure consistency with the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters expressed support for including reading fluency in the list of areas to be considered when determining whether a child has an SLD.

Discussion:  No assessment, in isolation, is sufficient to indicate that a child has an SLD.

Many commenters stated that the word "or" instead of "and" should be used between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii), because otherwise a child could be identified with an SLD because he or she failed to meet passing criteria on a State assessment, and failure to make sufficient progress on a State-approved assessment alone is not grounds for a determination that a child has an SLD.

Discussion:  We do not agree that "and" should be used instead of "or" between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii), because this would subject the child to two different identification models.  We agree that failing a State assessment alone is not sufficient to determine whether a child has an SLD.  However, failing a State assessment may be one factor in an evaluation considered by the eligibility group.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the evaluation must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant information about the child.  Further, Sec. 300.304(b)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act, is clear that determining eligibility for special education and related services cannot be based on any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree that Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) could be stated more clearly and will rewrite it to state that the eligibility group can determine that a child has an SLD if the child meets the criteria in Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age and State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of an SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested a definition of "State-approved results."

Furthermore, as stated in Sec. 300.101, the fact that a child is advancing from grade to grade does not make a child with a disability ineligible for special education and related services.  However, consistent with Sec. 300.8, the group making the eligibility determination must conclude both that the child has an SLD and, that, because of that disability, the child needs special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested more detail and specific guidelines on RTI models, such as information on who initiates the RTI process and who should be involved in the process; how one ensures there is a strong leader for the RTI process; the skills needed to implement RTI models; the role of the general education teacher; how to determine that a child is not responsive to instruction, particularly a child with cultural and linguistic differences; the number of different types of interventions to be tried; the responsibility for monitoring progress; the measurement of treatment integrity; and ways to document progress.  One commenter stated that it is imperative that the regulations allow the flexibility necessary to accommodate the array of RTI models already in use.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters requested that the Department define and set a standard for responsiveness that calls for demonstrated progress and improvement in the rate of learning, to indicate that a child can function in the classroom.  Several commenters stated that there would be a dramatic increase in the number of children identified with an SLD without a clearly defined system in place.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There are many RTI models and the regulations are written to accommodate the many different models that are currently in use.  The Department does not mandate or endorse any particular model.  Rather, the regulations provide States with the flexibility to adopt criteria that best meet local needs.  Language that is more specific or prescriptive would not be appropriate.  For example, while we recognize that rate of learning is often a key variable in assessing a child's response to intervention, it would not be appropriate for the regulations to set a standard for responsiveness or improvement in the rate of learning. As we discussed earlier in this section, we do not believe these regulations will result in significant increases in the number of children identified with SLD. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that, without additional clarity, eligibility criteria will vary substantially among States and that States will have definitions that are suited to their individual preferences, rather than a universal sense of what constitutes eligibility under SLD based on the research and national standards of professional practice.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  State eligibility criteria must meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.111 and LEAs must use these State-adopted criteria.  We believe that, although these provisions allow States some flexibility in how children with SLD are identified, the requirements in these provisions will ensure that SLD criteria do not vary substantially across States. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Department agrees that it is important to identify children with SLD early and to provide the necessary instruction and supports to avoid referrals to special education.  The extent to which States involve other interested parties (e.g., disability groups, parent groups) in the design or development of such a system is a decision that should be made by each State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that professional development requirements to implement RTI models should be incorporated into the regulations so RTI models are not haphazardly implemented.  One commenter stated that before RTI can be used systematically as part of the special education identification process, school districts must have administrative support at all levels, ongoing professional development for all staff, and coordination with institutions of higher education.  Several commenters recommended encouraging States to develop efficient, collaborative evaluation systems.  One commenter recommended requiring regular education teachers to address the needs of children with different learning styles, identify early and appropriate interventions for children with behavioral challenges, and understand and use data and assessments to improve classroom practices and learning.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that administrative support, professional development, and coordination with teacher training programs would be helpful in the effective implementation of RTI models.  We also agree that efficient and collaborative evaluation systems should be developed, and that all teachers, including regular education teachers, should be trained to address the needs of children with different learning styles, identify early and appropriate interventions for children with behavioral challenges, and understand and use data and assessments to improve classroom practices and learning.  However, professional development requirements are a State responsibility, consistent with Sec. 300.156 and section 612(a)(14) of the Act, and it would be inappropriate for the Department to include specific professional development requirements in these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that if a State prohibits the use of a discrepancy model, there would not be sufficient time or funds necessary to effectively train staff.  Several commenters asked that there be a transition period so that personnel can be adequately trained in RTI or other forms of assessment and observation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary for these regulations to require a transition period for implementing RTI models, particularly because there are many schools and districts currently implementing RTI models.  Under the requirements in section 614(b)(6) of the Act, which took effect July 1, 2005, States should have developed mechanisms to permit LEAs to use RTI models.  States may need to make adjustments based on these final regulations.  Nothing in these regulations requires an LEA to drop current practices in favor of a new model with no transition.  Obviously, a plan would need to be developed when changing to an RTI model, including strategies for implementation and professional development.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters stated that the use of RTI models would be costly, requiring massive staff training and resources.  Many commenters recommended ways in which the Department could support States in improving identification and interventions for children with SLD.  Commenters' recommendations included the following:  long-term, Statewide pilot studies on assessments and interventions for children with SLD; methods to increase the use of RTI; guidance on establishing appropriate timelines for instructional interventions; and information on new scientifically based approaches to identifying children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department recognizes the need for technical assistance and training to implement RTI models and is directing technical assistance funds under Part D of the Act, administered by the Department's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), toward this effort.  OSEP plans to develop and disseminate an RTI resource kit and devote additional resources to technical assistance providers to assist States in implementing RTI models.  OSEP will also continue to identify and develop model RTI implementation sites and evaluate SLD identification models in math and reading.  In addition, the Comprehensive Center on Instruction, jointly funded by OSEP and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), will provide technical assistance to States on RTI implementation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters supported examining the pattern of strengths and weaknesses in determining whether a child is considered to have an SLD.  A number of commenters stated that it is important that groups use a process to determine whether a child responds to scientific, research-based interventions, as well as consider relevant, empirically validated patterns of strengths and weaknesses in achievement, performance, or both, relative to intellectual development.  One commenter stated that "pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance" in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) is insufficiently defined and without a clearer definition of "pattern," schools will continue the wait-to-fail model.  One commenter recommended clarifying the meaning of "weakness," stating that weakness does not mean failure, and that there may be specific actions that could address weaknesses in performance that would result in failure if left alone.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Patterns of strengths and weaknesses commonly refer to the examination of profiles across different tests used historically in the identification of children with SLD.  We believe that the meaning of "pattern of strengths and weaknesses" is clear and does not need to be clarified in these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters stated that using a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in a child's performance to identify a child with an SLD could be misinterpreted to identify children, other than children with disabilities, who are underperforming due to cultural factors, environmental or economic disadvantage, or low effort.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.309(a)(3) is clear that children should not be identified with SLD if the underachievement is primarily the result of a visual, hearing, or motor disability; mental retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors; or environmental or economic disadvantage.  The eligibility group makes the determination after the evaluation of the child is completed.  Therefore, we believe that there is minimal risk that a child who is underachieving due to these factors will be identified as having an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended using "cognitive ability" in place of "intellectual development" because "intellectual development" could be narrowly interpreted to mean performance on an IQ test.  One commenter stated that the term "cognitive ability" is preferable because it reflects the fundamental concepts underlying SLD and can be assessed with a variety of appropriate assessment tools.  A few commenters stated that the reference to identifying a child's pattern of strengths and weaknesses that are not related to intellectual development should be removed because a cognitive assessment is critical and should always be used to make a determination under the category of SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the term "intellectual development" is the appropriate reference in this provision.  Section 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits the assessment of patterns of strengths and weakness in performance, including performance on assessments of cognitive ability.  As stated previously, "intellectual development" is included as one of three methods of comparison, along with age and State-approved grade-level standards.  The term "cognitive" is not the appropriate reference to performance because cognitive variation is not a reliable marker of SLD, and is not related to intervention.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter reviewed the list of factors in Sec. 300.309(a)(3) that must be ruled out as primary reasons for a child's performance and asked whether children with other health impairments (OHI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or speech impairments would overlap with the SLD definition.  Several commenters noted that many children with hearing, visual, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; or emotional disturbances (ED) also have concomitant learning disabilities that go unidentified, and that these children end up with lower academic and functional achievement levels than they should because an important contributing factor to their learning problems has not been addressed.  Several commenters recommended adding language to the regulations stating that a child with a disability other than an SLD may also be identified with an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Children with one of the disabilities in Sec. 300.8 should be identified as a child with a disability using the category that is most appropriate for the child.  Some children may be identified under other disability categories, such as OHI, TBI, ED, or speech impairment, and may also have low achievement and even meet SLD criteria.  Services must meet the child's needs and cannot be determined by the child's eligibility category.  We believe it is unnecessary to add language regarding SLD as a concomitant disability. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked what kind of assessment identifies culture as a primary cause of academic performance deficits and recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.309(a)(3)(iv) unless there are objective methods to determine whether a child's low performance is a result of cultural factors.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The identification of the effect of cultural factors on a child's performance is a judgment made by the eligibility group based on multiple sources of information, including the home environment, language proficiency, and other contextual factors gathered in the evaluation.  The Department believes that the identification of children with SLD will improve with models based on systematic assessments of a child's response to appropriate instruction, the results of which are one part of the information reviewed during the evaluation process to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  States and public agencies must follow the evaluation procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.304 and 300.305 and section 614(b) of the Act, including using assessments and other evaluation materials that do not discriminate on a racial or cultural basis, consistent with Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(i) and section 614(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that limited English proficiency be among the factors that the eligibility group must rule out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.306(b)(1)(iii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(C) of the Act, is clear that a child must not be identified as a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is limited English proficiency.  However, we agree that it is important to re-emphasize this requirement in Sec. 300.309 and will add this to the list of factors that the eligibility group must rule out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (vi) to Sec. 300.309(a)(3) to include "limited English proficiency" in the list of factors that must be ruled out as a primary factor affecting a child's performance before determining that a child is eligible for special education services under the category of SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters supported the requirement in Sec. 300.309(b)(1) for data demonstrating that a child suspected of having an SLD has been provided with high-quality, research-based instruction in regular education settings delivered by qualified personnel.  Several commenters stated that this requirement should apply to all children and asked why this requirement is confined to only children suspected of having SLD.  One commenter stated that if schools would use proven best practices, there would be fewer children in need of special education in the later grades.  However, one commenter stated that it is incorrect to assume that any child who is not responding to interventions must have an SLD when there are a myriad of reasons why children may not be responding to instruction.  One commenter recommended adding "to the extent practicable" to acknowledge that scientific research-based interventions are not available in many areas, particularly in mathematics.  One commenter recommended decreasing the emphasis on research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Sections 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, specifically state that children should not be identified for special education if the achievement problem is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or mathematics.  This issue is especially relevant to SLD because lack of appropriate instruction in these areas most commonly leads to identifying a child as having an SLD.  All children should be provided with appropriate instruction provided by qualified personnel.  This is an important tenet of the Act and the ESEA.  Both the Act and the ESEA focus on doing what works as evidenced by scientific research and providing children with appropriate instruction delivered by qualified teachers.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  We received a number of comments concerning the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction provided by qualified personnel.  One commenter stated that it would be difficult for rural school districts to meet this requirement because of staffing requirements in the regular education setting.  Several commenters stated that the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority and should be removed, because it provides a basis for challenging any determination under the category of SLD.  One commenter asked for clarification regarding the legal basis for providing high-quality, research-based instruction if the child is not determined eligible for special education.  Another commenter stated that attorneys will read Sec. 300.309(b) as providing a legal entitlement to ESEA, research-based instruction and data-based documentation for every child considered for eligibility under the category of SLD, and that when this standard is not met, will bring the matter to a due process hearing and request compensatory education. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerous commenters requested a definition of high-quality, research-based instruction.  One commenter asked who validates that the research meets the highest quality.  Another commenter asked that the regulations specify how much research a program must undergo before it is deemed to be research-based.  One commenter stated that the Department must address how States determine whether a child has been provided with a high-quality, research-based instructional program; whether appropriate classroom interventions were delivered; and whether an intervention has been successful.  One commenter stated that the absence of additional clarification would result in great disparity in States' policies and lead to inappropriate interventions and procedures.  One commenter recommended that there be evidence that the instruction is effective for the child's age and cultural background.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended that children who are not progressing because they have not received research-based instruction by a qualified teacher should immediately receive intensive, high-quality, research-based instruction by qualified personnel.  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.309(b) restricts referrals to only those children who have received high-quality, research-based instruction from qualified teachers.  One commenter stated that a child's eligibility to receive special education services under the category of SLD appears to be contingent on the LEA's commitment to providing effective regular education services by qualified staff, and, as such, a child with an SLD is held hostage by a system that is not working.  One commenter asked whether the eligibility group can make a determination that a child has an SLD in the absence of a child's response to high-quality research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that the lack of research-based instruction by a qualified teacher should not limit a child's eligibility for services.  Another commenter recommended clarifying that a child should not be found ineligible under the category of SLD because the child either did not respond to a scientific, research-based intervention during a truncated evaluation, or because the child was not provided an opportunity to respond to such an intervention.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Watering down a focus on appropriate instruction for any children, including children with disabilities or children living in rural areas would be counter to both the Act and the ESEA.  However, we agree that the requirement for high quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority.  The Act indicates that children should not be eligible for special education if the low achievement is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  Therefore, we will change the regulations to require that the eligibility group consider evidence that the child was provided appropriate instruction and clarify that this means evidence that lack of appropriate instruction was the source of underachievement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The eligibility group should not identify a child as eligible for special education services if the child's low achievement is the result of lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  Eligibility is contingent on the ability of the LEA to provide appropriate instruction.  Determining the basis of low achievement when a child has been given appropriate instruction is the responsibility of the eligibility group.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Whether a child has received "appropriate instruction" is appropriately left to State and local officials to determine.  Schools should have current, data-based evidence to indicate whether a child responds to appropriate instruction before determining that a child is a child with a disability.  Children should not be identified as having a disability before concluding that their performance deficits are not the result of a lack of appropriate instruction.  Parents of children with disabilities have due process rights that allow them to file a complaint on any matter that relates to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of their child with a disability, and the provision of FAPE to their child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised the introductory material in Sec. 300.309(b) to emphasize that the purpose of the review is to rule out a lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math as the reason for a child's underachievement.  We have also revised Sec. 300.309(b)(1) to refer to appropriate instruction rather than high-quality, research-based instruction, and removed the cross reference to the ESEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that many reading programs claim to be research-based, but lack credible evidence of the program's effectiveness.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Programs that claim to be research-based, but which are not based on sound scientific research, should not be considered research-based instruction by a State or LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked what criteria should be used to determine that the child was provided with appropriate high quality, research-based instruction, especially when the child has been home schooled or attends a private school.  One commenter asked about children referred for evaluation from charter schools and expressed concern that these children would not be eligible under the category of SLD because they did not have instruction delivered by qualified personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As part of the evaluation, the eligibility group must consider whether the child received appropriate instruction from qualified personnel.  For children who attend private schools or charter schools or who are home-schooled, it may be necessary to obtain information from parents and teachers about the curricula used and the child's progress with various teaching strategies.  The eligibility group also may need to use information from current classroom-based assessments or classroom observations.  On the basis of the available information, the eligibility group may identify other information that is needed to determine whether the child's low achievement is due to a disability, and not primarily the result of lack of appropriate instruction.  The requirements for special education eligibility or the expectations for the quality of teachers or instructional programs are not affected, and do not differ, by the location or venue of a child's instruction. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested a definition of "qualified personnel."  One commenter stated that teachers should be trained to deliver the program of instruction and simply saying they should be highly qualified is not sufficient.  One commenter recommended removing the phrase "qualified personnel" in Sec. 300.309(b)(1), because it is likely to be interpreted to mean that instruction must be delivered by highly qualified teachers, as defined in the ESEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.156 and section 614(a)(14) of the Act are clear that each State is responsible for establishing and maintaining personnel qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including that those personnel have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  Consistent with Sec. 300.18 and section 602(10) of the Act, a public school teacher, including a special education teacher, who teaches core academic subjects must meet the highly qualified teacher standards under the Act.  The term that is used in Sec. 300.309(b)(1), "qualified personnel," does not, and should not be interpreted to, require that private school teachers be "highly qualified" to deliver the instruction discussed in Sec. 300.309(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether the regulations require an LEA to provide high-quality, research-based instruction in the regular education setting prior to, or as part of, the referral process before the group can determine whether a child has an SLD.  One commenter recommended that research-based interventions occur prior to a referral to special education.  Several commenters stated that an evaluation to assess all areas of suspected disability should follow an assessment of a child's response to instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  What is important is that the group making the eligibility decision has the information that it needs to rule out that the child's underachievement is a result of a lack of appropriate instruction.  That could include evidence that the child was provided appropriate instruction either before, or as a part of, the referral process.  Evidence of appropriate instruction, including instruction delivered in an RTI model, is not a substitute for a complete assessment of all of the areas of suspected need.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended reinforcing the role of parents in determining whether a child has an SLD by adding language to Sec. 300.309(b) stating that the child's parents and the group of qualified professionals must consider whether the child is a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4)(A) of the Act, is clear that the parent of the child is included in eligibility determinations.

Discussion:  Data-based documentation refers to an objective and systematic process of documenting a child's progress.  This type of assessment is a feature of strong instruction in reading and math and is consistent with Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii) and section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, that children cannot be identified for special education if an achievement problem is due to lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters supported requiring data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals to be provided to parents during the time the child is receiving instruction.  One commenter emphasized the importance of documenting that the interventions used are data based and implemented with fidelity.  One commenter stated that data-based documentation should be provided to all parents of children with disabilities, not just children suspected of having SLD.  However, several commenters stated that requiring data-based documentation of repeated assessments is an additional bureaucratic requirement that is overly prescriptive and costly, and will require additional paperwork.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that one of the most important aspects of good teaching is the ability to determine when a child is learning and then to tailor instruction to meet the child's individual needs.  Effective teachers use data to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of a particular instructional strategy or program.  A critical hallmark of appropriate instruction is that data documenting a child's progress are systematically collected and analyzed and that parents are kept informed of the child's progress.  Assessments of a child's progress are not bureaucratic, but an essential component of good instruction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended removing the requirement for data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals because it would make it impossible to determine eligibility if a child is new to a school district and district personnel do not have a child's records with such information.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe removing the requirement is the appropriate solution to the commenter's problem.  States will need to adopt criteria for determining how to provide such data for children new to a district.  Children should not be identified as having SLD if there is no evidence of appropriate instruction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.309(b)(2), requiring parents to be informed of their child's repeated failure to perform well on assessments, could be interpreted to refer to the assessments under the ESEA and that this would mean that a child must perform poorly over a period of several school years to be considered for eligibility under the category of SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While the results of a child's performance on assessments under the ESEA may be included as data documenting a child's progress, relying exclusively on data from Statewide assessments under the ESEA would likely not meet the requirement for repeated assessments at "reasonable intervals," as required by these regulations.  It is possible that a State could develop other assessments tied to the State approved test that would meet these requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters asked how long an intervention should continue before determining a child has not made adequate progress and a referral for an evaluation to determine eligibility for special education is made.  Several commenters recommended that if a child is not making progress within 45 days, an evaluation should take place.  Other commenters recommended a time limit of 90 days.  One commenter recommended the regulations include a range of active intervention days, not just a waiting period, within which the IEP Team expects to notice a change, and recommended between 45-75 school days.  One commenter suggested 6-10 weeks as an appropriate period of time.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended requiring States to establish reasonable time limits for decision making.  Several commenters recommended requiring the IEP Team and the parents to agree on an appropriate period of time.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that unless a timeline is specified in the regulations, there would be different standards occurring throughout the country.  A few commenters expressed concern that if time limits were not clarified, school districts and parents would interpret the timelines differently, which would result in contentious situations and litigation.  One commenter stated that a parent could sue for compensatory services if, after requesting an evaluation, the LEA requires an assessment of how the child responds to high quality research-based instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that the lack of a specific timeline means that an evaluation could be indefinitely delayed and children denied services.  Several commenters recommended adding language to the regulations to ensure that RTI models could not be used to delay an evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability, access to special education and related services, or protections under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition to requesting a definition of an "appropriate period of time," a few commenters requested a definition of "adequate progress" and recommended adding language to require States to define "adequate progress."  One commenter stated that a child's rate of learning needs to be examined carefully.  One commenter offered a definition of a "developmentally appropriate rate" as the time or the number of repetitions required to have at least 85 percent of children at the same age or grade level acquire and retain the particular skill or academic levels, as established by research or by experience with the delivery of that curriculum or program. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Instructional models vary in terms of the length of time required for the intervention to have the intended effect on a child's progress.  It would not be appropriate for the Department to establish timelines or the other requirements proposed by the commenters in Federal regulations, because doing so would make it difficult for LEAs to implement models specific to their local school districts.  These decisions are best left to State and local professionals who have knowledge of the instructional methods used in their schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Department believes that good instruction depends on repeated assessments of a child's progress.  This allows teachers to make informed decisions about the need to change their instruction to meet the needs of the child, and also provides parents with information about their child's progress so that they can support instruction and learning at home.  Parents should be informed if there are concerns about their child's progress and should be aware of the strategies being used to improve and monitor their child's progress.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We understand the commenters' requests for more specific details on timelines and measures of adequate progress.  However, as noted above, these decisions are best left to professionals who have knowledge about the instructional models and strategies used in their States and districts.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We also understand the commenters' concerns that the requirements in Sec. 300.309(b) may result in untimely evaluations or services and that parents must be fully informed about the school's concerns about their child's progress and interventions provided by the school.  Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We will also add a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to ensure that the parents of a child suspected of having an SLD who has participated in a process that evaluates the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, are notified about the State's policies regarding collection of child performance data and the general education services that will be provided; strategies to increase their child's rate of learning; and their right to request an evaluation at any time.  If parents request an evaluation and provide consent, the timeframe for evaluation begins and the information required in Sec. 300.309(b) must be collected (if it does not already exist) before the end of that period.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have combined proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revised the new paragraph (c) in Sec. 300.309 to require the public agency to promptly request parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided appropriate instruction, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We also have added a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to require that the eligibility report include evidence that when a child has participated in an RTI process, the parents were informed of State policies regarding child performance data that would be collected and the general education services that would be provided; strategies to support the child's rate of learning; and a parent's right to request an evaluation at any time.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended clarifying when parental consent for evaluation should be obtained and when the 60-day timeline to complete an evaluation begins.  Several commenters recommended ensuring that the 60-day timeline for evaluation applies regardless of the evaluation model used.  One commenter asked how scientific research-based interventions could be completed within a 60-day evaluation timeline.  One commenter stated that 60 days may not be enough time to appropriately determine whether a child responds to instruction, particularly for children who have not had exposure to such interventions (e.g., children entering the public school system for the first time).  One commenter asked if the intent of the regulations is to allow a determination that a child has an SLD to take place outside the timeline for an initial evaluation, and stated that without clarification of the intersection between an RTI process (that may, by definition, require additional time beyond that which is permitted for an evaluation) and the required period of time for an initial assessment, the regulations would cause confusion and result in improper evaluations and eligibility determinations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters recommended that the regulations address the need for an extension of the timeline and allow States to set an alternative timeline without a written agreement.  Several commenters requested adding a provision for an extended timeline, with parental consent, in exceptional circumstances.  Several commenters stated that the language regarding an extension of timelines is confusing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.309(c), as revised, clarifies that if a child has not made adequate progress after an appropriate period of time, a referral for an evaluation must be made.  As required in Sec. 300.301(c), the initial evaluation must be conducted within 60 days of receiving consent for an evaluation (or if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be completed, within that timeframe).  Models based on RTI typically evaluate the child's response to instruction prior to the onset of the 60-day period, and generally do not require as long a time to complete an evaluation because of the amount of data already collected on the child's achievement, including observation data.  RTI models provide the data the group must consider on the child's progress when provided with appropriate instruction by qualified professionals as part of the evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.309(b)(1) requires that the eligibility group consider data on the child's progress when provided with appropriate instruction by qualified professionals as part of this evaluation.  These data, along with other relevant information, will assist the eligibility group in determining whether the child's low achievement is attributable to a lack of appropriate instruction.  As required in Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) and (ii), consistent with section 614(b)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, a child cannot be identified as a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Based on their review of the existing data, and input from the child's parents, the eligibility group must decide, on a case-by-case basis, depending on the needs of the child and the information available regarding the child, what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  If the eligibility group determines that additional data are needed and that these data cannot be obtained within the 60-day timeframe (or the timeframe established by the State), new Sec. 300.309(c) (proposed Sec. 300.309(d)) allows the extension of the timeframe with mutual written agreement of the child's parent and the eligibility group.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that the regulations appear to set up a separate process and procedure for the evaluation and identification of children with SLD, and then impose the timeframe and procedures that apply to the evaluation of all other disability categories.  One commenter stated that the timeframe for evaluating children with SLD is less stringent than for other disability categories and is, therefore, discriminatory.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Although there are additional criteria and procedures for evaluating and identifying children suspected of having SLD, the group must also comply with the procedures and timelines that apply to all evaluations, including evaluations for SLD.  Evaluation of children suspected of having SLD must follow the same procedures and timeframes required in Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.306, in addition to those in Sec. Sec. 300.307 through 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended removing the observation requirements in Sec. 300.310, stating that they are costly and overly prescriptive and have no statutory basis.  One commenter stated that the requirements for determining eligibility under the category of SLD are so specific that the observation requirements are unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The observation requirements for children suspected of having SLD have been in the regulations since before 1983.  Important information can be obtained about a child through observation in the classroom, or for a child less than school age, in an environment appropriate for a child of that age.  Objective observations are essential to assessing a child's performance and should be a part of routine classroom instruction and are not costly or overly prescriptive.  We believe the observation requirements are an important matter to regulate clearly.  We will, therefore, change Sec. 300.310(a) through Sec. 300.310(c) to clearly state that the public agency must ensure appropriate observation and documentation of the child's academic performance and behavior in the areas of difficulty to determine whether a child has an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed Sec. 300.310(a) through Sec. 300.310(c) to clearly state the observation requirements in determining whether a child has an SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters supported requiring a member of the group to be trained in observation.  Many commenters requested clarification regarding what it means to be trained in observation.  One commenter stated that there are no established training protocols or uniform professional standards for conducting an observation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the requirement for an individual to be trained in observation is unclear and should be removed.  States are responsible for determining specific personnel qualification requirements, and, for the reasons stated under Sec. 300.308, States and LEAs should determine appropriate group membership.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "trained in observation" from Sec. 300.310(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that the public agency should determine the most appropriate individual to conduct the observation.  One commenter recommended specifying a reading specialist to conduct the observation when the child's learning problems involve reading.  Another commenter stated that the observer should not be limited to a member of the eligibility group.  One commenter stated that it is not necessary to obtain parental consent for the observation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The person conducting the observation should be a member of the eligibility group because information from the observation will be used in making the eligibility determination.  If information is available from an observation conducted as part of routine classroom instruction that is important for the eligibility group to consider, the eligibility group should include the person who conducted that routine classroom.  This will eliminate redundant observations and save time and resources.  Parental consent is not required for observations conducted as part of routine classroom instruction and monitoring of the child's performance before the child is referred for an evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If an observation has not been conducted, or additional observation data are needed, the decision as to which person should conduct the observation is best left to members of the eligibility group, based on the type of information that is needed to make the eligibility determination and identify the child's needs.  Parental consent is required for observations conducted after the child is suspected of having a disability and is referred for an evaluation.  We will revise Sec. 300.310 to clarify the different ways in which observation data may be obtained and to clarify that parental consent is required for observations conducted after the child is suspected of having a disability and is referred for an evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised Sec. 300.310 to specify in paragraph (a) that the public agency must ensure that the child is observed in the child's learning environment.  A new Sec. 300.310(b) has been added to require the eligibility group to use the information obtained from the routine classroom observation or conduct a new observation and to require parental consent for observations conducted after the child is suspected of having a disability and is referred for an evaluation.  Proposed Sec. 300.310(b) has been redesignated as new Sec. 300.310(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clear guidance about the working relationship between the special education teacher and the general education teacher in conducting an observation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We decline to provide specific guidance on the working relationship between the special education teacher and the general education teacher in conducting an observation because this relationship will necessarily vary depending on how classrooms are structured and teacher responsibilities assigned.  Such decisions are best made at the local level.  Generally, we would expect that the child's general education teacher would have data from routine classroom instruction and would work with the other members of the eligibility group to determine what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether a child has an SLD.  A special education teacher who is experienced in working with children with SLD, for example, might have suggestions on ways to structure a particular observation session to obtain any additional information that is needed, and may be able to assist the general education teacher in gathering the data.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Observation data will generally be a part of the existing data reviewed for any child suspected of having a disability.  Section 300.305(a)(1) requires the eligibility group for any child suspected of having a disability to review existing evaluation data, including classroom-based observations and observations by teachers and related services providers.  We do not believe that requiring an observation of children suspected of other disabilities is necessary, however, as identification of those other disabilities is not always as dependent on classroom performance and behavior as is identification of children with SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters supported the requirements for the written report, stating that they provide a useful framework for practitioners.  However, several commenters stated that the requirements for the written report should be removed because they go beyond the requirements of the Act and impose additional procedural and paperwork burdens for school personnel.  Several commenters stated that the report is much more detailed than the evaluation and eligibility report for children with other disabilities, and stated that this could discourage schools from evaluating children suspected of having SLD.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(b)(4)(B) of the Act requires the public agency to provide a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility to the parents for all children evaluated under the Act.  Section 300.311 specifies the content for the evaluation report for children suspected of having SLD.  States and LEAs have more discretion over the specific content of an evaluation report for children suspected of having a disability under the other disability categories.  Therefore, whether the SLD evaluation report is more detailed or burdensome than other evaluation reports would depend on State and local requirements.  We believe that the elements of the report specified in Sec. 300.311 provide important checks to prevent misidentification and ensure that children who actually have SLD are identified.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The information required in the written report in Sec. 300.311 is a part of the documentation of eligibility required in Sec. 300.306(a)(2).  Section 300.306(b) and (c) lists the requirements for eligibility determinations for all children suspected of having a disability, including children suspected of having SLD.  Section 300.311 provides specific elements that must be addressed in the report for children suspected of having SLD.  Two separate reports are not necessary as long as the information in Sec. 300.311 is included in the documentation of the eligibility determination in Sec. 300.306(a)(2).  We agree that this should be clarified.

Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (6) to Sec. 300.311(a) to require the written report to include a statement on the effects of cultural factors, limited English proficiency, environmental, or economic disadvantage.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested clarification of what happens if a group member disagrees with the report and agreement is never reached.

Discussion:  The eligibility group should work toward consensus, but under Sec. 300.306, the public agency has the ultimate responsibility to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  Parents and school personnel are encouraged to work together in making the eligibility determination.  If the parent disagrees with the public agency's determination, under Sec. 300.503, the public agency must provide the parent with prior written notice and the parent's right to seek resolution of any disagreement through an impartial due process hearing, consistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.503 and section 615(b)(3) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.320 refer to a "student with a disability" instead of a "child with a disability."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The words "child" and "student" are used interchangeably throughout the Act.  The regulations follow the statutory language whenever possible.  In Sec. 300.320, we used the term "child with a disability," consistent with section 614(d) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations include a definition of "functional" as it is used, for example, in "functional performance" in Sec. 300.320(a)(1) and "functional goals" in Sec. 300.320(a)(2).  Some commenters suggested defining "functional" as the acquisition of essential and critical skills needed for children with disabilities to learn specific daily living, personal, social, and employment skills, or the skills needed to increase performance and independence at work, in school, in the home, in the community, for leisure time, and for postsecondary and other life long learning opportunities.  One commenter recommended that the regulations include examples of functional skills and how functional skills should be measured.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to include a definition of "functional" in these regulations because we believe it is a term that is generally understood to refer to skills or activities that are not considered academic or related to a child's academic achievement.  Instead, "functional" is often used in the context of routine activities of everyday living.  We do not believe it is necessary to include examples of functional skills in the regulations because the range of functional skills is as varied as the individual needs of children with disabilities.  We also decline to include examples of how functional skills are measured because this is a decision that is best left to public agencies, based on the needs of their children.  However, it should be noted that the evaluation procedures used to measure a child's functional skills must meet the same standards as all other evaluation procedures, consistent with Sec. 300.304(c)(1).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.320(a) to state that "an IEP includes" rather than "an IEP must include" in order to reflect the specific language in section 614(d) of the Act.  The commenter stated that use of the word "must" limits the contents of an IEP to the items listed in Sec. 300.320(a).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The word "must" is used in Sec. 300.320(a) to clarify that an IEP is required to include the items listed in Sec. 300.320(a).  We believe it is important to retain this language in Sec. 300.320(a).  Under section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, section 614 of the Act cannot be interpreted to require content in the IEP beyond that which is specified in the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The word "appropriate" in these regulations does not have a different meaning from its common usage.  Generally, the word "appropriate" is used to mean "suitable" or "fitting" for a particular person, condition, occasion, or place. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring the IEP to include a statement of the relevant social and cultural background of a child and how those factors affect the appropriate participation, performance, and placement of the child in special education.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act precludes the Department from interpreting section 614 of the Act to require public agencies to include information in a child's IEP other than what is explicitly required in the Act.  Therefore, we cannot require the IEP to include the statement requested by the commenters.  However, a child's social or cultural background is one of many factors that a public agency must consider in interpreting evaluation data to determine if a child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8 and the educational needs of the child, consistent with Sec. 300.306(c)(1)(i).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that adapted physical education should be part of a child's IEP.  Another commenter recommended that travel training be required in the IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The definition of special education in new Sec. 300.39 (proposed Sec. 300.38) includes adapted physical education and travel training.  We do not believe adapted physical education and travel training should be mandated as part of an IEP because, as with all special education and related services, each child's IEP Team determines the special education and related services that are needed to meet each child's unique needs in order for the child to receive FAPE.  In addition, section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act prohibits the Department from interpreting section 614 of the Act to require public agencies to include information in a child's IEP that is not explicitly required under the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that requires new tools or the same tools and materials used by nondisabled children to be used with children with disabilities or be specified in children's IEPs.  Therefore, we cannot make the requested change because section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act prohibits the Department from interpreting section 614 of the Act to require public agencies to include information in a child's IEP that is not explicitly required under the Act.  Each child's IEP Team determines the special education and related services, as well as supplementary aids, services, and supports that are needed to meet the child's needs in order to provide FAPE consistent with Sec. 300.320(a)(4) and section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  "Academic achievement" generally refers to a child's performance in academic areas (e.g., reading or language arts, math, science, and history).

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that not every child requires a functional performance statement or functional annual goals.  Some commenters stated that requiring functional assessments for all children places an unnecessary burden on an LEA, does not add value for every child, and creates a potential for increased litigation.  One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.320(a)(1), regarding the child's present levels of performance, and Sec. 300.320(a)(2), regarding measurable annual goals, clarify that functional performance and functional goals should be included in a child's IEP only if determined appropriate by the child's IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations require a child's present levels of performance to be aligned with the child's annual goals.  Another commenter stated that the content of the IEP should be aligned with the State's core curriculum content standards and the knowledge and skills needed for children with disabilities to become independent, productive, and contributing members of their communities and the larger society.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The IEP Team's determination of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum is a primary consideration in the development of the child's annual IEP goals.  Section 300.320(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(aa) of the Act, requires the statement of a child's present levels of performance in the IEP to include how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum.  This directly corresponds with the provision in Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i)(A) and section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa) of the Act, which requires the IEP to include measurable annual goals designed to meet the child's needs that result from the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.  We do not believe further clarification is needed regarding the alignment of a child's present levels of performance with the child's annual goals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the alignment of the IEP with the State's content standards, Sec. 300.320(a)(1)(i) clarifies that the general education curriculum means the same curriculum as all other children.  Therefore, an IEP that focuses on ensuring that the child is involved in the general education curriculum will necessarily be aligned with the State's content standards.  Congress acknowledged, in section 601(c)(5)(A) of the Act, that ensuring access to the general education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible, is also effective in preparing children with disabilities to lead productive and independent adult lives.  We do not believe further clarification is necessary to address the commenters' concerns.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarification as to whether IEP goals must be specific to a particular discipline (e.g., physical therapy goals, occupational therapy goals).

One commenter recommended clarifying that an IEP Team is permitted, under certain circumstances, to write goals that are intended to be achieved in less than one year.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(2)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, requires the IEP to include measurable annual goals.  Further, Sec. 300.320(a)(3)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the Act, requires the IEP to include a statement of how the child's progress toward meeting the annual goals will be measured.  The Act does not require goals to be written for each specific discipline or to have outcomes and measures on a specific assessment tool.  Furthermore, to the extent that the commenters are requesting that we mandate that IEPs include specific content not in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, under section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I), we cannot interpret section 614 to require that additional content.

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring related services in every child's IEP.  The commenters stated that related services are necessary to enhance the overall health and well-being of the child to prevent secondary conditions; ensure that the child progresses towards independent functioning and community integration; increase the child's ability to function and learn in his or her educational environment; develop social interaction skills to enhance a child's ability to communicate, build relationships, and reinforce other positive behavior skills; and further advance the child's ability to complete his or her own educational requirements and goals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  To require related services for every child with a disability would be inconsistent with the concept of individualization that has been part of the Act since its inception in 1975.  Related services are only required to the extent that such services are necessary to enable the child to benefit from special education.  Related services, as with any other service in an IEP, are determined on an individual basis by the child's IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters opposed the removal of benchmarks and short-term objectives as required components of the IEP and recommended that States and LEAs be permitted to require benchmarks and short-term objectives for all children with disabilities.  Many commenters recommended that the regulations allow the IEP Team to determine whether to include short-term objectives in a child's IEP to measure progress in functional areas that are not measurable through other means.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Benchmarks and short-term objectives were specifically removed from section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act.  However, because benchmarks and short-term objectives were originally intended to assist parents in monitoring their child's progress toward meeting the child's annual goals, we believe a State could, if it chose to do so, determine the extent to which short-term objectives and benchmarks would be used.  However, consistent with Sec. 300.199(a)(2) and sections 608(a)(2) and 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, a State that chooses to require benchmarks or short-term objectives in IEPs in that State would have to identify in writing to the LEAs located in the State and to the Secretary that such rule, regulation, or policy is a State-imposed requirement, which is not required by Part B of the Act or the Federal regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters supported the requirement in Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(ii) for benchmarks or short-term objectives to be developed for children who take alternate assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards.  However, a few commenters stated that limiting short-term objectives to children who take alternate assessments is not acceptable because the one percent limit on the percentage of children who may take alternate assessments is arbitrary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement to develop short-term objectives or benchmarks covers all children with disabilities who are assessed using alternate assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards, consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the Act.  The one percent cap referred to by the commenter is not a limit on the number of children who may take an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.  Rather, it is a limit on the number of proficient and advanced scores that may be included in calculating adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the ESEA, consistent with 34 CFR Sec. 200.13(c)(1)(ii).

Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(2)(ii) requires benchmarks or short-term objectives only for children with disabilities who take alternate assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards.

Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(2)(ii), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the Act, requires an IEP to include benchmarks or short-term objectives for children with disabilities who take an alternate assessment aligned to alternate achievement standards.  This would apply to preschool children and children with disabilities in kindergarten through grade two only if these children are assessed in a State or districtwide assessment program and the State has opted to develop an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.  Under title 1 of the ESEA, States are only required to assess children in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school, so it is unlikely that even States that choose to develop alternate achievement standards will include this age population in a Statewide assessment program or develop an alternate achievement standard for these children. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(16)(C)(ii) of the Act requires alternate assessments to be aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and academic achievement standards, and if the State has adopted alternate academic achievement standards permitted under 34 CFR Sec. 200.1(d), to measure the achievement of children with disabilities against those standards.  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act requires the IEP to include a statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals, designed to meet the child's needs that result from the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.  However, there is nothing in the Act that requires a child's IEP goals to be aligned with the State's alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.

Discussion:  The requirement in current Sec. 300.350(a)(1), regarding a public agency's responsibility to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability in accordance with the child's IEP, is unnecessary, because entitlement to FAPE under the Act includes the provision of special education and related services in accordance with an IEP.  Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) in current Sec. 300.350, regarding accountability for a child achieving his or her goals, are unnecessary because other Federal laws, such as title I of the ESEA, already provide sufficient motivation for agency effort to assist children with disabilities in making academic progress.  Current Sec. 300.350(c), regarding the rights of parents to invoke due process procedures if a parent feels that efforts are not being made to achieve the IEP goals, is unnecessary because it merely provides explanatory information regarding the due process procedures for parents and children that are available in Sec.

Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(4) incorporates the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act, which requires that special education and related services and supplementary aids and services be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.  The Act does not refer to "evidenced-based practices" or "emerging best practices," which are generally terms of art that may or may not be based on peer-reviewed research.  Therefore, we decline to change Sec. 300.320(a)(4) in the manner suggested by the commenters.  The phrase "to the extent practicable," as used this context, generally means that services and supports should be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent that it is possible, given the availability of peer-reviewed research.  We do not believe further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended clear guidance on the responsibilities of States, school districts, and school personnel to provide special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are based on peer-reviewed research.  One commenter requested clarification that the requirement for special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services to be based on peer-reviewed research does not mean that the service with the greatest body of research is the service necessarily required for FAPE.  Another commenter requested that the regulations clarify that the failure of a public agency to provide special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services based on peer-reviewed research, does not result in a denial of FAPE, and that the burden of proof is on the moving party when the denial of FAPE is at issue.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act requires special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services, to be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.  States, school districts, and school personnel must, therefore, select and use methods that research has shown to be effective, to the extent that methods based on peer-reviewed research are available.  This does not mean that the service with the greatest body of research is the service necessarily required for a child to receive FAPE.  Likewise, there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the failure of a public agency to provide services based on peer-reviewed research would automatically result in a denial of FAPE.  The final decision about the special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are to be provided to a child must be made by the child's IEP Team based on the child's individual needs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment regarding the burden of proof when the denial of FAPE is at issue, we have addressed this issue in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart E.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended including a construction clause in the regulations to clarify that no child should be denied special education and related services, or supplementary aids and services, based on a lack of available peer-reviewed research on a particular service to be provided.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the recommended construction clause is necessary.  Special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services based on peer-reviewed research are only required "to the extent practicable."  If no such research exists, the service may still be provided, if the IEP Team determines that such services are appropriate.  A child with a disability is entitled to the services that are in his or her IEP whether or not they are based on peer-reviewed research.  The IEP Team, which includes the child's parent, determines the special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are needed by the child to receive FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the reference to "peer-reviewed research" does not require an IEP to include instructional methodologies.  However, a few commenters recommended that the regulations require all elements of a program provided to a child, including program methodology, to be specified in the child's IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that requires an IEP to include specific instructional methodologies.  Therefore, consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, we cannot interpret section 614 of the Act to require that all elements of a program provided to a child be included in an IEP.  The Department's longstanding position on including instructional methodologies in a child's IEP is that it is an IEP Team's decision.  Therefore, if an IEP Team determines that specific instructional methods are necessary for the child to receive FAPE, the instructional methods may be addressed in the IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations require programs provided to a child with a disability to be research-based with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While the Act clearly places an emphasis on practices that are based on scientific research, there is nothing in the Act that requires all programs provided to children with disabilities to be research-based with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child where not practicable.  We do not believe the recommended change should be made because, ultimately, it is the child's IEP Team that determines the special education and related services that are needed by the child in order for the child to receive FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  It is not necessary to refer to assistive technology devices in Sec. 300.320(a)(4).  Section 300.324(a)(2)(v), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(v) of the Act, already requires the IEP Team to consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Participation with nondisabled children (Sec. 300.320(a)(5))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2402%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended that Sec. 300.320(a)(5), regarding the participation of children with disabilities with nondisabled children, follow the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(V) of the Act and use the term "regular class" instead of "regular educational environment."  One commenter stated that parents, school staff, and the community consider the "regular class" to be the place where a child's nondisabled peers go to school, while "regular educational environment" is interpreted to be anywhere in the school, such as down the hallway, in a separate wing of the school, or across the lunch room.  One commenter stated that the term "regular education environment" could be interpreted to mean only special classes such as art, music, and gym.  A few commenters recommended defining "regular education environment" to mean the participation of children with disabilities with their nondisabled peers in the regular classroom and other educational settings, including nonacademic settings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that use of the term "regular educational environment" may be misinterpreted.  Therefore, we will revise Sec. 300.320(a)(5) to require the IEP to include an explanation of the extent, if any, to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in the regular class. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(5) follows the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(V) of the Act and applies to all children with disabilities covered by Part B of the Act, which includes preschool children under section 619 of the Act.

Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring parents to be informed in writing of the consequences of their child taking an alternate assessment, including any effect on the child's eligibility for graduation with a regular high school diploma.  The commenters stated that providing this information to parents is particularly important in States that require passing a State exam in order to obtain a regular high school diploma.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(16) of the Act requires that the State, (or, in the case of a districtwide assessment, the LEA) develop and implement guidelines for the participation of children with disabilities in alternate assessments, including alternate assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards permitted under 34 CFR 200.1(d).  Section 200.6(a)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of the ESEA title I regulations requires States to inform parents that their child's achievement will be measured against alternate achievement standards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We acknowledge that these requirements do not specifically require a public agency to inform parents of any potential consequences of a child participating in an alternate assessment.  The commenters' recommendation will be considered along with other comments we have received in response to the NPRM proposing changes to Sec. 300.160, which was published in the Federal Register on December 15, 2005 (70 FR 74624).

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the Act requires that the IEP include a statement of any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic and functional performance of the child on State and districtwide assessments.  The requirements in proposed Sec. 300.160, published in the Federal Register on December 15, 2005, provide additional information about accommodations and the participation of children with disabilities in State and districtwide assessments.

Comment:  One commenter recommended changing the word "must" in Sec. 300.320(a)(6)(ii) to state that if an IEP Team determines that the child will take an alternate assessment, the IEP "will" include a statement of why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment.  The commenter stated that "will" is less coercive and more in line with the consensus decision-making model of IEP Team meetings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Generally, we have used the word "must" for regulations that describe what a public agency must do and the word "will" when referring to what the IEP Team has determined a child will do.  While we understand the commenter's concern, we believe it is unnecessary to change Sec. 300.320(a)(6)(ii).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.320(a)(6) clarify that a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities, who has been determined by the IEP Team to be unable to make progress toward the regular achievement standards even with the best instruction, will be taught and assessed based on alternate achievement standards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to require a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities to be taught and assessed based on alternate achievement standards.  Consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb) of the Act, the child's IEP Team is responsible for determining the particular assessment that is appropriate for a child.  Under Sec. 200.1(d) of the ESEA title I regulations, a State is permitted, but not required, to adopt alternate achievement standards and develop an alternate assessment based on those standards for children with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  There is no requirement under the Act or the ESEA that a State develop an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.320(a)(6) should include information about alternate assessments because there will be children who will not be successful with generic accommodations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(16)(C) of the Act provides information regarding alternate assessments and the requirements for alternate assessments under the Act.

Comment:  One commenter suggested revising Sec. 300.320(a)(6)(i), which requires the IEP to include a statement of any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to "measure" the academic and functional performance of the child on State and districtwide assessments.  The commenter recommended revising the statement to require the IEP to include a statement of any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to allow the child to "participate" in assessments.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  To change the regulation in the manner suggested by the commenter would be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.320(a)(6)(i) reflects the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the Act and requires accommodations that are necessary to measure a child's performance.  Accommodations that allow a child to "participate" in assessments could include accommodations that invalidate the child's test score, thereby resulting in an assessment that does not "measure" a child's performance. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Initiation, frequency, location, and duration of services (Sec. 300.320(a)(7))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2429%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that the term "duration" in Sec. 300.320(a)(7), regarding services and modifications in the IEP, refers to the length of a particular service session and not the entire IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The meaning of the term "duration" will vary, depending on such things as the needs of the child, the service being provided, the particular format used in an IEP, and how the child's day and IEP are structured.  What is required is that the IEP include information about the amount of services that will be provided to the child, so that the level of the agency's commitment of resources will be clear to parents and other IEP Team members.  The amount of time to be committed to each of the various services to be provided must be appropriate to the specific service, and clearly stated in the IEP in a manner that can be understood by all involved in the development and implementation of the IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Act does not require the IEP to include information about the specific person(s) providing the services.

Transition services (Sec. 300.320(b))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2436%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters disagreed with changing the age at which transition services must be provided to a child with a disability from 14 years to 16 years.  One commenter recommended that transition services begin at age 13.  Another commenter recommended that transition services begin before high school, because if there is a choice of high schools, transition goals may be a determining factor in the selection process.  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that States may continue to begin transition services with the first IEP after the child turns age 14.  Some commenters recommended that transition begin two to four full school years before the child is expected to graduate because some children may exit school at age 17.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerous commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that States have discretion to require transition services to begin before age 16 for all children in the State.  However, a few commenters recommended removing the phrase "or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team" in Sec. 300.320(b) because the language is not in the Act and promotes additional special education services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended that the regulations require transition planning to begin earlier than age 16 if necessary for the child to receive FAPE.  Other commenters recommended clarifying that, in order for transition services to begin by age 16, transition assessments and other pre-planning needs that would facilitate movement to post-school life must be completed prior to the child's 16th birthday.  One commenter recommended requiring transition planning to begin no later than the child's freshman year in high school and that this planning include selecting assessment instruments and completing assessments that will lead to the development of transition goals and objectives in the child's IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act requires that transition services begin no later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16.  Because IEP Team decisions must always be individualized, we have included the phrase "or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team" in Sec. 300.320(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Act does not require transition planning or transition assessments, as recommended by some commenters.  Therefore, consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, we cannot interpret section 614 of the Act to require that IEPs include this information because it is beyond what is specifically required in the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Department believes that a State could require transition services, if it chose to do so, to begin before age 16 for all children in the State.  However, consistent with Sec. 300.199(a)(2) and section 608(a)(2) of the Act, a State that chooses to require transition services before age 16 for all children would have to identify in writing to its LEAs and to the Secretary that such rule, regulation, or policy is a State-imposed requirement that is not required by Part B of the Act and Federal regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that Sec. 300.320(b) clarify that the child is a participating IEP Team member and that the IEP Team is required to consider the child's preferences in developing transition goals and services. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The clarification requested is not needed because Sec. 300.321(b)(1) already requires the public agency to invite a child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting, if a purpose of the meeting is to consider the child's postsecondary goals and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.  In addition, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting.  We believe that this is sufficient clarification that, for the purposes mentioned by the commenter, the child is a participating IEP Team member. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify whether "transition assessments" are formal evaluations or competency assessments.  One commenter stated that transition assessments should be different for a college-bound child with a disability than for a child with severe disabilities whose future is a group home.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the requested clarification is necessary because the specific transition assessments used to determine appropriate measurable postsecondary goals will depend on the individual needs of the child, and are, therefore, best left to States and districts to determine on an individual basis.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarification of the term "postsecondary goals."  Another commenter recommended defining "postsecondary goals" in the definition section of these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to include a definition of "postsecondary goals" in the regulations.  The term is generally understood to refer to those goals that a child hopes to achieve after leaving secondary school (i.e., high school).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16 years of age, section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII)(aa) of the Act requires a child's IEP to include measurable postsecondary goals in the areas of training, education, and employment, and, where appropriate, independent living skills.  Therefore, the only area in which postsecondary goals are not required in the IEP is in the area of independent living skills.  Goals in the area of independent living are required only if appropriate.  It is up to the child's IEP Team to determine whether IEP goals related to the development of independent living skills are appropriate and necessary for the child to receive FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations retain the requirement in current Sec. 300.347(b)(1) that requires IEPs to include a statement of the transition service needs of the child under applicable components of the child's IEP that focus on the child's courses of study (such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a vocational education program).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement referred to by the commenter is already in the regulations.  Section 300.320(b)(2) includes a reference to "courses of study" as part of transition services, consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII)(bb) of the Act.  The examples in current Sec. 300.347(b)(2) (i.e., advanced placement course or a vocational education program) are not included in Sec. 300.320(b)(2) because we do not believe they are necessary to understand and implement the requirement. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations explicitly require transition services to include vocational and career training through work-study and documentation of accommodations needed in the workplace.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not require IEPs to include vocational and career training or documentation of workplace accommodations.  Consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, we cannot interpret section 614 of the Act to require IEPs to include information beyond what is specifically required in the Act.

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that schools can use funds provided under Part B of the Act to support children in transitional programs on college campuses and in community-based settings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the clarification requested by the commenters is necessary to add to the regulations because, as with all special education and related services, it is up to each child's IEP Team to determine the special education and related services that are needed to meet each child's unique needs in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, if a child's IEP Team determines that a child's needs can best be met through participation in transitional programs on college campuses or in community-based settings, and includes such services on the child's IEP, funds provided under Part B of the Act may be used for this purpose.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended more accountability for transition services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act contains significant changes to the monitoring and enforcement requirements under Part B of the Act.  Section 300.600, consistent with section 616(a) of the Act, requires the primary focus of monitoring to be on improving educational results and functional outcomes for children with disabilities.  The provisions in section 616(a) and (b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act set forth the responsibility of States to monitor the implementation of the Act, enforce the Act, and annually report on performance of the State and each LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.600(c), consistent with section 616(a)(3) of the Act, requires States to measure performance in monitoring priority areas using quantifiable indicators and such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance.  Section 300.601 reflects statutory language in section 616(b) of the Act and requires States to have a performance plan that evaluates their efforts to implement the requirement and purposes of the Act.  Transition services are specifically being addressed in State performance plans.

A few commenters recommended that a recreation therapist or specialist be included on the IEP Team.  Other commenters stated that a practitioner skilled in assistive technology should be included.

Some commenters stated that individuals from the child welfare system should be included as members of the IEP Team and should be invited to attend IEP Team meetings when the purpose of the meeting is to consider transition services for a child who is a ward of the State or in the custody of the child welfare agency.

Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to require that individuals with specific professional knowledge or qualifications attend all IEP Team meetings.

Section 300.321(a)(6), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(vi) of the Act, already allows other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child, including related services personnel, as appropriate, to be included as members of a child's IEP Team at the discretion of the parent or the agency.  Therefore, we decline to make the changes recommended by the commenters.  However, it should be noted that if a public agency wishes to invite officials from another agency, such as officials of the child welfare agency that are not representing the child, the public agency must obtain parental consent for the individual to participate in the IEP Team meeting because confidential information about the child from the child's education records would be shared at the meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Act does not require an IEP Team manager as a part of the IEP Team.  While having one individual manage the provision of services under the IEP might be a good practice in particular circumstances, we decline to require IEP Team managers for all IEPs because, in many cases, it would be unnecessary.  In addition, to ensure that all IEP Team members are aware of their responsibilities regarding the implementation of a child's IEP, Sec. 300.323(d) requires that the child's IEP be accessible to each regular education teacher, special education teacher, related services provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Sec. 300.114 through 300.120, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, are clear that each public agency must ensure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who are nondisabled.

This is not a new requirement.  The same requirement is in current Sec. 300.344(a)(3).  As noted in Attachment I of the March 12, 1999 final regulations, the special education teacher or provider who is a member of the child's IEP Team should be the person who is, or will be, responsible for implementing the IEP.  For example, if the child's disability is a speech impairment, the special education teacher or special education provider could be the speech language pathologist.

A public agency may determine which specific staff member will serve as the agency representative in a particular IEP Team meeting, so long as the individual meets these requirements.

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that IEP Team meetings are being used by parent advocates to train parents of other children, and by attorneys to train their associates about the school's IEP process.  In order to prevent this, these commenters stated that the regulations should identify the specific knowledge and expertise that an individual must have to be included on an IEP Team.

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(B)(vi) of the Act allows other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child to be included on a child's IEP Team.  Section 300.321(c) provides that the determination of the knowledge or special expertise of these individuals must be made by the party (parents or public agency) who invited the individual to be a member of the IEP Team.  We continue to believe that this determination is best left to parents and the public agency.  We also believe that it would be inappropriate to regulate on the specific knowledge and expertise that an individual must have to be included on an IEP Team because it would be burdensome for both parents and public agencies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Additionally, nothing in the Act prevents parents from consenting to have an observer who is not a member of the IEP Team present at the meeting, as the parent can consent to the sharing of confidential information about the child.

Discussion:  We do not believe that the additional clarification requested by the commenters is necessary.  Section 614(d)(1)(B)(vii) of the Act clearly states that the IEP Team includes the child with a disability, whenever appropriate.  Generally, a child with a disability should attend the IEP Team meeting if the parent decides that it is appropriate for the child to do so.  If possible, the agency and parent should discuss the appropriateness of the child's participation before a decision is made, in order to help the parent determine whether or not the child's attendance would be helpful in developing the IEP or directly beneficial to the child, or both.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Further, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.

Discussion:  We believe that, although not specified in the Act, the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b) are necessary to assist children with disabilities to successfully transition from high school to employment, training, and postsecondary education opportunities.  We believe it is critical for children with disabilities to be involved in determining their transition goals, as well as the services that will be used to reach those goals.  Section 300.321(b), therefore, requires the public agency to invite the child to attend IEP Team meetings in which transition goals and services will be discussed.  If the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The involvement and collaboration with other public agencies (e.g., vocational rehabilitation agencies, the Social Security Administration) can be helpful in planning for transition and in providing resources that will help children when they leave high school.  We believe that children with disabilities will benefit when transition services under the Act are coordinated with vocational rehabilitation services, as well as other supports and programs that serve all children moving from school to adult life.

Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) for parental consent (or consent of a child who has reached the age of majority) before inviting personnel from participating agencies to attend an IEP Team meeting because it is burdensome, may reduce the number of agencies participating in the IEP Team meeting, and may limit the options for transition services for the child.  The commenters stated that this consent is unnecessary under FERPA, and inconsistent with Sec. 300.321(a)(6), which allows the parent or the agency to include other individuals in the IEP Team who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.321(b)(3) was included in the regulations specifically to address issues related to the confidentiality of information.  Under section 617(c) of the Act the Department must ensure the protection of the confidentiality of any personally identifiable data, information, and records collected or maintained by the Secretary and by SEAs and LEAs pursuant to Part B of the Act, irrespective of the requirements under FERPA.  We continue to believe that a public agency should be required to obtain parental consent (or the consent of a child who has reached the age of majority) before inviting representatives from other participating agencies to attend an IEP Team meeting, consistent with Sec. 300.321(b)(3).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) are inconsistent with Sec. 300.321(a)(6).  Section 300.321(a)(6) permits other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child to attend the child's IEP Team meeting at the discretion of the parent or the public agency.  It is clear that in Sec. 300.321(b)(3), the individuals invited to the IEP Team meeting are representatives from other agencies who do not necessarily have special knowledge or expertise regarding the child.  In these situations, we believe that consent should be required because representatives of these agencies are invited to participate in a child's IEP Team meeting only because they may be providing or paying for transition services.  We do not believe that representatives of these agencies should have access to all the child's records unless the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) gives consent for such a disclosure.  Therefore, we believe it is important to include the requirement for consent in Sec. 300.321(b)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing the phrase, "to the extent appropriate" in Sec. 300.321(b)(3) and requiring public agencies to invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services to the IEP Team meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the recommended change because the decision as to whether to invite a particular agency to participate in a child's IEP Team meeting is a decision that should be left to the public agency and the parent (or the child with a disability who has reached the age of majority).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii), which requires the public agency to take steps to ensure the participation of invited agencies in the planning of any transition services when the agencies do not send a representative to the IEP Team meeting.  These commenters stated that the participation of other agencies is vital to ensuring that the child receives the necessary services.  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that, aside from inviting other agencies to attend a child's IEP Team meeting, public agencies have no obligation to obtain the participation of agencies likely to provide transition services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act has never given public agencies the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services for a child with a disability, including when the requirements in Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) were in effect.  Without the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services, public agencies have not been able to meet the requirement in current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) to "ensure" the participation of other agencies in transition planning.  Therefore, while we believe that public agencies should take steps to obtain the participation of other agencies in the planning of transition services for a child, we believe it is unhelpful to retain current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  We received many comments from individuals expressing concern about allowing IEP Team members to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations require all IEP Team members to attend all IEP Team meetings without exception.  One commenter stated that excusing members from attending IEP Team meetings interrupts the flow of the meeting and takes away time from discussing the child's needs.  Another commenter expressed concern that the integrity of the IEP Team meeting process depends on a discussion to determine the services that are necessary to meet the child's unique needs, and that the richness of this discussion may be diminished if IEP Team members are allowed to be excused too frequently and the IEP Team must rely on written input.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters recommended that the regulations acknowledge that, in most circumstances, interactive discussion in IEP Team meetings is preferable to written input.  Many commenters requested that the multidisciplinary scope of the IEP Team meeting be maintained.  One commenter stated that written input from an excused IEP Team member is not sufficient and will be burdensome for both the writer and the readers.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act allows a parent of a child with a disability and the LEA to agree that the attendance of an IEP Team member at an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, is not necessary under certain conditions.  Allowing IEP Team members to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting is intended to provide additional flexibility to parents in scheduling IEP Team meetings and to avoid delays in holding an IEP Team meeting when an IEP Team member cannot attend due to a scheduling conflict.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters stated that the excusal provisions in Sec. 300.321 should be optional for States and that States should be allowed to require that all IEP Team members attend each IEP Team meeting.  Several commenters recommended allowing States to determine the circumstances or conditions under which attendance at the IEP Team meeting is not required.  A few commenters recommended clarifying whether a State must have policies and procedures to excuse IEP Team members.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, a State must allow a parent and an LEA to agree to excuse a member of the IEP Team.  Section 300.321(e) reflects this requirement and we do not have the authority to make this optional for States.  We also do not have the authority to allow a State to restrict, or otherwise determine, when an IEP Team member can be excused from attending a meeting, or to prohibit the excusal of an IEP Team member when the LEA and parent agree to the excusal.  Whether a State must have policies and procedures to excuse IEP Team members from attending an IEP Team meeting will depend on whether such policies and procedures are required by a State to implement this statutory requirement.  However, every State must allow a parent and an LEA to agree to excuse an IEP Team member from attending an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether the excusal agreement must meet the standard for informed consent.  Some commenters stated that Congress intended excusal agreements to mean informed written consent.  Other commenters stated that parents, not the public agency, can provide consent and therefore, only parents should be allowed to provide consent for excusing IEP Team members from IEP Team meetings.  A few commenters recommended simplifying Sec. 300.321(e) by eliminating the different procedures for different types of excusals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Whether a parent must provide consent to excuse a member of the IEP Team from attending an IEP Team meeting depends on whether the member's area of the curriculum or related services is being modified or discussed at the IEP Team meeting.  We cannot eliminate the different procedures for different types of excusals because section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act clearly differentiates between circumstances in which parental consent is required and when an agreement is required to excuse an IEP member from attending an IEP Team meeting. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If the member's area is not being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, provides that the member may be excused from the meeting if the parent and LEA agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary.  An agreement is not the same as consent, but instead refers to an understanding between the parent and the LEA.  Section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act specifically requires that the agreement between a parent and an LEA to excuse a member's attendance at an IEP Team meeting must be in writing.  If, however, the member's area is being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(2), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires the LEA and the parent to provide written informed consent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether parents must be provided any information when asked to excuse IEP Team members.  A few commenters recommended that the request for an excusal include the reason for the request to excuse a member of the IEP Team, that it be written in the chosen language of the parent, and accompanied by written evaluations and recommendations of the excused IEP Team member.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended that no IEP Team member should be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting until the parent is informed about the purpose of the meeting for which the public agency proposes to excuse the IEP Team member; the IEP Team member's name and position; the reason(s) the public agency wants to excuse the IEP Team member; the parent's right to have the IEP Team member present; and the parent's right to discuss with the IEP Team member any issues in advance of the meeting so the parent is adequately informed.  The commenters stated that this notice should be included in any statement of parent's rights that is distributed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerous commenters recommended that the regulations include specific language to clarify that, before agreeing to excuse an IEP Team member, serious consideration must be given to determining if written input will be sufficient to thoroughly examine what services are needed and whether changes to the current IEP are necessary.  A few commenters recommended that parents be informed of the roles and responsibilities of the excused member prior to giving consent for the excusal.  Some commenters stated that parents must understand that they have the right to disagree and not excuse a member of the IEP Team who the parents believe may be essential to developing or revising an IEP.  One commenter recommended that the written agreement be required to include information that the parent was informed of the parent's right to have all IEP Team members present.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended permitting States to establish additional procedural safeguards that guarantee that parents who consent to excuse an IEP member from a meeting do so freely and are aware of the implications of their decisions.  Some commenters expressed concern that a parent could be pressured to agree to excuse an IEP Team member for what, in reality, are economic or staffing reasons.  One commenter stated that parents should have the right to consent to excusal only after conferring with the individual to be excused.  Some commenters recommended that parents be informed that they have a legal right to require an IEP Team member to participate in the meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters expressed concern that the permission to excuse IEP Team members from attending IEP Team meetings will be abused, particularly with language-minority parents who are often misinformed or misled by school districts.  Some commenters stated that parents do not understand the roles of the various members and could easily be pressured into excusing vital members of the IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended that the regulations include requirements to guard against excessive excusals.  Some commenters stated that an LEA that routinely prevents general or special education teachers, or related services providers, from attending IEP Team meetings using the excusal provisions should be subject to monitoring and review.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  When an IEP Team member's area is not being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, provides that the member may be excused from the meeting if the parent and LEA agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary.  We believe it is important to give public agencies and parents wide latitude about the content of the agreement and, therefore, decline to regulate on the specific information that an LEA must provide in a written agreement to excuse an IEP Team member from attending the IEP Team meeting when the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	When an IEP Team member's area is being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(2), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires the LEA and the parent to provide written informed consent.  Consistent with Sec. 300.9, consent means that the parent has been fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, and understands that the granting of consent is voluntary and may be revoked at any time.  The LEA must, therefore, provide the parent with appropriate and sufficient information to ensure that the parent fully understands that the parent is consenting to excuse an IEP Team member from attending an IEP Team meeting in which the member's area of the curriculum or related services is being changed or discussed and that if the parent does not consent the IEP Team meeting must be held with that IEP Team member in attendance.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that these requirements are sufficient to ensure that the parent is fully informed before providing consent to excuse an IEP Team member from attending an IEP Team meeting in which the member's area of the curriculum will be modified or discussed, and do not believe that it is necessary to include in the regulations the more specific information that commenters recommended be provided to parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also do not believe it is necessary to add a regulation permitting States to establish additional procedural safeguards for parents who consent to excuse an IEP Team member, as recommended by one commenter, because we believe the safeguard of requiring consent will be sufficient to prevent parents from feeling pressured to excuse an IEP Team member.  Furthermore, parents who want to confer with an excused team member may ask to do so before agreeing or consenting to excusing the member from attending the IEP Team meeting, but it would be inappropriate to add a regulation that limited parent rights by requiring a conference before the parent could agree or consent to the excusal of an IEP Team member.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the recommendation that the notice state that the parent has a legal right to require an IEP Team member to participate in an IEP Team meeting, it is important to emphasize that it is the public agency that determines the specific personnel to fill the roles for the public agency's required participants at the IEP Team meeting.  A parent does not have a legal right to require other members of the IEP Team to attend an IEP Team meeting.  Therefore, if a parent invites other public agency personnel who are not designated by the LEA to be on the IEP Team, they are not required to attend.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
An LEA may not routinely or unilaterally excuse IEP Team members from attending IEP Team meetings as parent agreement or consent is required in each instance.  We encourage LEAs to carefully consider, based on the individual needs of the child and the issues that need to be addressed at the IEP Team meeting whether it makes sense to offer to hold the IEP Team meeting without a particular IEP Team member in attendance or whether it would be better to reschedule the meeting so that person could attend and participate in the discussion.  However, we do not believe that additional regulations on this subject are warranted.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	An LEA that routinely excuses IEP Team members from attending IEP Team meetings would not be in compliance with the requirements of the Act, and, therefore, would be subject to the State's monitoring and enforcement provisions.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested clarification on whether excusals from IEP Team meetings apply to only regular education teachers, special education teachers, and related services providers, or to all individuals whose curriculum areas may be discussed at an IEP Team meeting.  One commenter recommended clarifying that all IEP Team members, as defined in Sec. 300.321, must be represented at the IEP Team meeting unless excused by the parents and the LEA. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter stated that Sec. 300.321(e) can be read to require that each individual invited to the IEP Team meeting by the parent or the public agency (who has knowledge or special expertise) must attend the meeting unless the parent and the agency agree in writing that they need not attend.  The commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that the attendance of the other individuals invited to attend the IEP Team meeting by the parent and public agency is discretionary and that no waiver is needed to hold the IEP Team meeting without them.  The commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.321(e)(1) to refer to "mandatory" members of the IEP Team.  Another commenter expressed concern that it is not possible to pre-determine the areas of the curriculum that may be addressed at an IEP Team meeting, and recommended that excusals be permitted only for the IEP Team members identified by the public agency in Sec. 300.321(a). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that the regulations allow teachers with classroom responsibilities to attend an IEP Team meeting for 15 to 20 minutes and leave the meeting when necessary.  Some commenters requested clarification regarding situations in which there is more than one regular education teacher at an IEP Team meeting and whether one or both teachers must have a written excusal to leave before the end of an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that it is unclear whether consent must be obtained if a speech pathologist or occupational therapist cannot attend a meeting because speech pathologists and occupational therapists are not required members of an IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that the excusals from IEP Team meetings apply to the members of the IEP Team in paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) in Sec. 300.321, that is, to the regular education teacher of the child (if the child is, or may be participating in the regular education environment); not less than one special education teacher of the child (or where appropriate, not less than one special education provider of the child); a representative of the public agency who meets the requirements in Sec. 300.321(a)(4); and an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results.  We do not believe it is necessary to require consent or a written agreement between the parent and the public agency to excuse individuals who are invited to attend IEP Team meetings at the discretion of the parent or the public agency because such individuals are not required members of an IEP Team.  We will add new language to Sec. 300.321(e) to clarify the IEP Team members for whom the requirements regarding excusals apply. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to situations in which there is more than one regular education teacher, the IEP Team need not include more than one regular education teacher.  The regular education teacher who serves as a member of a child's IEP Team should be a teacher who is, or may be, responsible for implementing a portion of the IEP so that the teacher can participate in discussions about how best to instruct the child.  If the child has more than one regular education teacher responsible for carrying out a portion of the IEP, the LEA may designate which teacher or teachers will serve as the IEP member(s), taking into account the best interest of the child.  An LEA could also agree that each teacher attend only the part of the meeting that involves modification to, or discussion of, the teacher's area of the curriculum.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.321(a)(3) requires the IEP Team to include not less than one special education teacher or where appropriate, not less than one special education provider of the child.  As explained earlier, a special education provider is a person who is, or will be, responsible for implementing the IEP.  Therefore, if a speech pathologist, occupational therapist, or other special education provider, other than the child's special education teacher is on the IEP Team, written consent from the parent would be required for the speech pathologist, occupational therapist, or other special education provider to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, when the IEP Team meeting involves a modification to, or discussion of, the IEP Team member's related service or area of the curriculum.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.321(e)(1) to refer to paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5), and a reference to paragraph (e)(1) in Sec. 300.321(e)(2) to clarify the IEP Team members for whom a parent and public agency must consent or agree in writing to excuse from an IEP Team meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

There is no requirement that the excused IEP Team member agree to be excused from the IEP Team meeting, that a teacher be included as one of the parties that decides whether a teacher should be excused from attending the IEP Team meeting, or that other IEP Team members agree to excuse a member's attendance.  It is up to each public agency to determine the individual in the LEA with the authority to make the agreement (or provide consent) with the parent to excuse an IEP Team member from attending an IEP Team meeting.

Discussion:  The IEP Team is expected to act in the best interest of the child.  As with any IEP Team meeting, if additional information is needed to finalize an appropriate IEP, there is nothing in the Act that prevents an IEP Team from reconvening after the needed information is obtained, as long as the IEP is developed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of the Act and these regulations.  The parent can request an additional IEP Team meeting at any time and does not have to agree to excuse an IEP Team member.  Likewise, if a parent learns at the IEP Team meeting that a required participant will not be at the meeting, the parent can agree to continue with the meeting and request an additional meeting if more information is needed, or request that the meeting be rescheduled.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Many commenters recommended that the regulations include language requiring that any agreement to excuse an IEP Team member from attending the IEP Team meeting be done in advance of the meeting.  Some commenters stated that requiring an agreement in advance of an IEP Team meeting would allow the parent to review the IEP Team member's written input prior to the IEP Team meeting and ensure that parental consent is informed.  A few commenters recommended that the Act prohibit a written agreement from being signed before the meeting occurs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not specify how far in advance of an IEP Team meeting a parent must be notified of an agency's request to excuse a member from attending an IEP Team meeting or when the parent and LEA must sign a written agreement or provide consent to excuse an IEP Team member.  Ideally, public agencies would provide parents with as much notice as possible to request that an IEP Team member be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, and have agreements or consents signed at a reasonable time prior to the IEP Team meeting.  However, this might not always be possible, for example, when a member has an emergency or an unavoidable scheduling conflict.  To require public agencies to request an excusal or obtain a signed agreement or consent to excuse a member a specific number of days prior to an IEP Team meeting would effectively prevent IEP Team members from being excused from IEP Team meetings in many situations and, thus, be counter to the intent of providing additional flexibility to parents in scheduling IEP Team meetings.  Furthermore, if an LEA requests an excusal at the last minute or a parent needs additional time or information to consider the request, the parent always has the right not to agree or consent to the excusal of the IEP Team member.  We, therefore, decline to regulate on these matters.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify the timeframe in which the written input must be provided to the parent and the IEP Team.  Another commenter expressed concern that without knowing whether the information submitted is sufficient to answer any of the parent's questions, the parent could not agree, in any informed way, to excuse an IEP Team member from attending the IEP Team meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters recommended that written input be provided to parents a reasonable amount of time prior to the meeting and not at the beginning of the meeting.  One commenter recommended requiring that parents receive written evaluations and recommendations from the excused member at least 10 business days before the IEP Team meeting.  Another commenter recommended that written input be provided at least 10 school days in advance of the meeting; another commenter suggested no later than seven days before the meeting; a few commenters recommended at least five days in advance of the meeting; and some commenters recommended at least three business days before the meeting. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended requiring public agencies to send parents the written input of excused IEP Team members as soon as they receive it so that parents have sufficient time to consider the input.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require the written input to be provided to IEP Team members and parents at the same time.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act requires that input into the development of the IEP by the IEP Team member excused from the meeting be provided prior to the IEP Team meeting that involves a modification to, or discussion of the member's area of the curriculum or related services.  The Act does not specify how far in advance of the IEP Team meeting that the written input must be provided to the parent and IEP Team members.  For the reasons stated earlier, we do not believe it is appropriate to impose a specific timeframe for matters relating to the excusal of IEP Team members.  Parents can always reschedule an IEP Team meeting or request that an IEP Team meeting be reconvened if additional time is needed to consider the written information.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

	A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the written input must be sufficient to allow the IEP Team to thoroughly examine the services needed and decide whether changes to the current IEP are needed.

Other commenters recommended that the written input include the IEP Team member's opinions regarding the child's eligibility and services needed; the basis for the opinions, including any evaluations or other documents that formed the basis for the IEP Team member's opinion; and whether the evaluations were conducted by the IEP Team member or another person.  These commenters also recommended that the regulations require the excused IEP Team member to include a telephone number where the IEP Team member can be reached prior to the meeting if the parent wants to contact the member, and a telephone number where the member can be reached during the meeting in case immediate input during the meeting is required.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended prohibiting public agencies from giving the child the written input at school to take home to his or her parents.

Another commenter recommended that the regulations allow the written input to be provided to parents and other IEP Team members by electronic mail or other less formal methods.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not specify the format or content to be included in the written input provided by an excused member of the IEP Team.

We believe that such decisions are best left to local officials to determine based on the circumstances and needs of the individual child, parent, and other members of the IEP Team, and therefore decline to regulate in this area. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.321(e), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, describes the circumstances under which an IEP Team member may be excused from an IEP Team meeting.

We believe that these requirements are sufficient to ensure that parents are provided the opportunity to participate in meetings.  We also believe that State and local officials are in the best position to determine how far in advance parents must be notified of a meeting, as this will vary based on a number of factors, including, for example, the distance parents typically have to travel to the meeting location and the availability of childcare.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several comments were received requesting that additional information be provided to parents when the public agency notifies parents about an IEP Team meeting.  One commenter recommended informing parents that they can request an IEP Team meeting at any time.  Other commenters recommended that the notice include any agency requests to excuse an IEP Team member from attending the meeting, and any written input from an IEP Team member who is excused from the meeting.  Another commenter recommended that parents receive all evaluation reports before an IEP Team meeting.  A few commenters recommended that parents receive a draft IEP so that they have time to examine the child's present levels of performance; prepare measurable goals; and consider appropriate programs, services, and placements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The purpose of the notice requirement in Sec. 300.322 is to inform parents about the IEP Team meeting and provide them with relevant information (e.g., the purpose, time, and place of the meeting, and who will be in attendance).  This is not the same as the procedural safeguards notice that informs parents of their rights under the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If, at the time the IEP Team meeting notice is sent, a public agency is aware of the need to request that an IEP Team member be excused from the IEP Team meeting, the public agency could include this request with the meeting notice.  We do not believe that it is appropriate to require that the request to excuse an IEP Team member from an IEP Team meeting be included in the meeting notice, because the public agency may not be aware of the need to request an excusal of a member at the time the IEP Team meeting notice is sent.  For similar reasons, it is not appropriate to require that the IEP Team meeting notice include any written input from an IEP Team member who may be excused from the IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As noted in Sec. 300.306(a)(2), the public agency must provide a copy of an evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility at no cost to the parent.  Whether parents receive all evaluation reports before an IEP Team meeting, however, is a decision that is best left to State and local officials to determine.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With respect to a draft IEP, we encourage public agency staff to come to an IEP Team meeting prepared to discuss evaluation findings and preliminary recommendations.  Likewise, parents have the right to bring questions, concerns, and preliminary recommendations to the IEP Team meeting as part of a full discussion of the child's needs and the services to be provided to meet those needs.  We do not encourage public agencies to prepare a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, particularly if doing so would inhibit a full discussion of the child's needs.  However, if a public agency develops a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, the agency should make it clear to the parents at the outset of the meeting that the services proposed by the agency are preliminary recommendations for review and discussion with the parents.  The public agency also should provide the parents with a copy of its draft proposals, if the agency has developed them, prior to the IEP Team meeting so as to give the parents an opportunity to review the recommendations of the public agency prior to the IEP Team meeting, and be better able to engage in a full discussion of the proposals for the IEP.  It is not permissible for an agency to have the final IEP completed before an IEP Team meeting begins.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that Sec. 300.322(d) retain paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) in current Sec. 300.345, which provide examples of the types of records a public agency may keep to document its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed upon time and place for an IEP Team meeting.  These examples include detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses received; and detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits.

Section 300.322(d) states that an IEP Team meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to convince a parent to attend the IEP Team meeting.  Similarly, Sec. 300.501(c)(4) provides that a group, without the involvement of the parent, may make a placement decision if the public agency is unable to obtain the parent's participation in the decision.

Section 300.322(c) requires the public agency to use other methods to ensure parent participation if neither parent can attend an IEP Team meeting, including individual or conference telephone calls.

Comment:  One commenter stated that an IFSP that was incorrectly developed by the early intervention agency should not be the school district's responsibility to correct.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The development of an IFSP for children from birth through age two is the responsibility of the designated lead agency responsible for early intervention programs under section 635(a)(10) in Part C of the Act.  When a child turns age three, section 612(a)(9) of the Act requires each State to ensure that an IEP has been developed and implemented.  However, if a child turns age three and an LEA and a parent agree to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, as allowed under section 614(d)(2)(B) of the Act, the LEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b) are met.  Therefore, if an IFSP was incorrectly developed by the early intervention agency and the public agency and the parent agree to use the IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the LEA is responsible for modifying the IFSP so that it meets the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenter.  Section 300.124, consistent with section 612(a)(9) of the Act, already requires States to have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that children transitioning from an early intervention program under Part C of the Act to a preschool program under Part B of the Act experience a smooth and effective transition to those preschool programs.  In addition, each LEA is required to participate in transition planning conferences with the lead agency responsible for providing early intervention services and to have an IEP (or an IFSP, if consistent with Sec. 300.323(b) and section 636(d) of the Act) for the child developed and implemented by the child's third birthday.  We believe that in the course of the transition planning conferences and developing the child's IEP, there would be many opportunities for discussions regarding the services provided under Parts B and C of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that there is no statutory basis to require detailed explanations of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP or for written informed parental consent when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe it is important to retain these requirements in Sec. 300.323(b)(2) because of the importance of the IEP as the statutory vehicle for ensuring FAPE to a child with a disability.  Although the Act does not specifically require a public agency to provide detailed explanations to the parent of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP, we believe parents need this information to make an informed choice regarding whether to continue to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP.  Parents, for example, should understand that it is through the IEP that the child is entitled to the special education and related services that the child's IEP Team determines are necessary to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and to receive FAPE.  If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.  For a parent to waive the right to an IEP, informed parental consent is necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.323(b)(1) provides that, in order for the IFSP to be used as the IEP, the IFSP must contain the IFSP content (including the natural environments statement) in section 636(d) of the Act and be developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under Part B of the Act.  For children who are at least three years of age, the IFSP must also include an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills.  There is no requirement for the IFSP to include all the required elements in an IEP.  We think this point is clear in the regulations and that no further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended changing Sec. 300.323(b)(2)(i) to require parental consent before a preschool-aged child receives an IFSP in States that have a policy under section 635(c) of the Act.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether States have flexibility to continue early intervention services until the end of the school year in which a child turns three.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.323(b) outlines the specific requirements that apply when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP for children aged three through five, as a means of providing FAPE for the child under Part B of the Act.  This is not the same as the policy in section 635(c) of the Act, which gives States the flexibility to provide early intervention services under Part C of the Act to three year old children with disabilities until they enter into, or are eligible under State law to enter into, kindergarten.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Under Sec. 300.323(b), when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP, the child continues to receive FAPE.  This would not be the case under section 635(c) of the Act.  Under section 635(c) of the Act, parents of children with disabilities who are eligible for preschool services under section 619 of the Act and previously received early intervention services under Part C of the Act, may choose to continue early intervention services until the child enters, or is eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten.  The option to continue early intervention services is available only in States where the lead agency under Part C of the Act and the SEA have developed and implemented a State policy to provide this option.  This option will be detailed in the Part C regulations, and not the Part B regulations, as it permits a continuation of eligibility and coverage under Part C of the Act, rather than FAPE under Part B of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended removing the requirement for an IEP Team meeting to be conducted within 30 days of determining that the child needs special education and related services.

A few commenters recommended that the regulations require the meeting to be held no later than 15 days after the eligibility determination.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement to conduct a meeting to develop a child's IEP within 30 days of the determination that a child needs special education and related services is longstanding, and has been included in the regulations since they were first issued in final form in 1977.  Experience has shown that many public agencies choose to conduct the meeting to develop the child's IEP well before the 30-day timeline.  Reducing the timeline to 15-days, as some commenters suggest, would be impractical, because there are situations when both public agencies and parents need additional time to ensure that appropriate individuals can be present at the meeting.  Experience has demonstrated that the 30-day timeline for conducting a meeting to develop an IEP is a reasonable time to provide both public agencies and parents the opportunity to ensure that required participants can be present at the IEP Team meeting.  Therefore, we decline to alter this longstanding regulatory provision.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.342(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii), which require teachers and providers to be informed of their specific responsibilities for implementing an IEP, and the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided to the child in accordance with the child's IEP.  Several commenters stated that a child's IEP should be readily accessible and all those involved in a child's education should be required to read and understand it. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.323(d) requires that the child's IEP be accessible to each regular education teacher, special education teacher, related services provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that teachers and providers understand their specific responsibilities for implementing an IEP, including any accommodations or supports that may be needed.  We agree with the commenters' recommendation and believe retaining current Sec. 300.342(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) is necessary to ensure proper implementation of the child's IEP and the provision of FAPE to the child.  However, the mechanism that the public agency uses to inform each teacher or provider of his or her responsibilities is best left to the discretion of the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Several technical changes are needed in proposed Sec. 300.323(e) for clarity and improved readability.  We believe that readability will be improved by reorganizing this provision into three separate paragraphs--paragraph (e), which will address transfers within the same State, paragraph (f), which will address transfers from another State, and paragraph (g), which will address the transmittal of records. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In addition, clarity will be improved by changing certain terms to align with terms that are more commonly used in this part.  For example, while the Act uses the term "Program" in the title of this requirement (referring to an "individualized education program"), we believe it would be clearer to use "IEP" throughout this provision.  In addition, as noted in the discussion of Sec. 300.304(c)(5), we believe that it is important to include language stating that the requirements in Sec. 300.323 are applicable to children with disabilities who have an IEP in effect in a previous public agency and who transfer to a new school within the same "school year," rather than the same "academic year," because "school year" is the term most commonly understood by parents and school officials.  Further, it is important that the regulations clearly and consistently differentiate between the responsibilities of the "new" public agency and the "previous" public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have restructured proposed Sec. 300.323(e) into three separate paragraphs, and each paragraph has been re-named to comport with the three concepts in the statutory requirement.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to define "comparable services" in these regulations because the Department interprets "comparable" to have the plain meaning of the word, which is "similar" or "equivalent."  Therefore, when used with respect to a child who transfers to a new public agency from a previous public agency in the same State (or from another State), "comparable" services means services that are "similar" or "equivalent" to those that were described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency, as determined by the child's newly-designated IEP Team in the new public agency. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517.  We believe these options adequately address circumstances in which comparable services are considered unreasonable. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment that the stay-put provisions should be imposed by the new State if the parent disagrees with the new public agency about the comparability of services, stay-put would not apply, because the evaluation is considered an initial evaluation and not a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

We do not believe that an explicit regulation is needed, however, because Sec. 300.324(a)(1)(iv) requires the IEP Team, in developing each child's IEP, to consider the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child.  A child's performance on State or districtwide assessments logically would be included in the IEP Team's consideration of the child's academic needs.

Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the consideration of special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) is not sufficient to address the behavioral needs of children with disabilities in the IEP process and recommended strengthening the regulations by encouraging school districts to utilize research-based positive behavioral supports and systematic and individual research-based interventions.  One commenter recommended training teachers regarding the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the changes recommended by the commenters need to be made to Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i).  Whether a child needs positive behavioral interventions and supports is an individual determination that is made by each child's IEP Team.  Section 300.321(a)(2)(i) requires the IEP Team, in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others, to consider the use of positive behavioral supports, and other strategies to address that behavior.  We believe that this requirement emphasizes and encourages school personnel to use positive behavioral interventions and supports.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, the regulations reflect the Department's position that high-quality professional development, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, is important to ensure that personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities.  Section 300.207, consistent with section 613(a)(3) of the Act, requires each LEA to ensure that all personnel necessary to carry out Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared, subject to the requirements in Sec. 300.156 and section 2122 of the ESEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, clearly states that each State must establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  Further, section 2122(b)(1)(B) of the ESEA requires an LEA's application to the State for title II funds (Preparing, training, and recruiting high quality teachers and principals) to address how the LEA's activities will be based on a review of scientifically based research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In addition, the implementation of early intervening services in Sec. 300.226 specifically focuses on professional development for teachers and other school staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions, and providing educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports.  We expect that the professional development activities and the services authorized under Sec. 300.226(b)(1) will be derived from scientifically based research.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Finally, because the definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion to the new Sec. 300.35.  Under the definition, scientifically based research must be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal or approved by a panel of independent experts through a comparably rigorous, objective, and scientific review.  In short, we believe that the Act and the regulations place a strong emphasis on research based supports and interventions, including positive behavioral interventions and supports.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

We do not believe there should be a requirement that the IEP Team consider such interventions, supports, and strategies for a particular group of children, or for all children with a particular disability, because such decisions should be made on an individual basis by the child's IEP Team.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the special factors for a child who is blind or visually impaired include a requirement for a clinical low vision evaluation to determine whether the child has the potential to utilize optical devices for near and distance information before providing instruction in Braille and the use of Braille.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act requires instruction in Braille to be provided unless the IEP Team determines that instruction in Braille or in the use of Braille is not appropriate for the child.  However, the Act does not require a clinical low vision evaluation, and we do not believe it would be appropriate to include such a requirement in the regulations.

Discussion:  The issues raised by the commenters are already covered in the regulations.  Section 300.324(a)(2)(iii), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, requires the IEP Team, in the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, to provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille, unless the IEP Team determines (after an evaluation of the child's reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media) that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate.  As noted earlier, a new paragraph (b)(2) has been added to Sec. 300.324 to require the IEP Team to consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when the IEP is reviewed and revised.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require IEP Teams, for a child who is deaf, to consider the child's communication abilities, ensure that the child can access language and communicate with peers and adults, and ensure that the child has an educational placement that will meet the child's communication needs.  The commenters also recommended that the IEP Team be required to consider the qualifications of the staff delivering the child's educational program. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concerns are already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.324(a)(2)(iv), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider the child's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With respect to the commenters' recommendation regarding qualified staff to deliver the child's educational program, Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, requires the SEA to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained to serve children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters suggested that Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(iv) explain that:  (a) a primary language assessment and assessment of communication abilities may be required to determine the child's most effective language; (b) program and placement decisions must be based on such assessments; (c) a child must be in an educational placement where the child may communicate with peers and adults; and (d) a deaf child's educational placement must include a sufficient number of peers and adults who can communicate fluently in the child's primary language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to include in the regulations the additional language recommended by the commenters.  Section 300.324(a)(1)(iii), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider, among other things, the results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child, which for a child who is deaf, may include an assessment of a child's communication abilities.  Further, Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(iv), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode.

Comment:  One commenter requested that emotional issues be considered an additional special factor that can impede learning.

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include emotional issues as a special factor to be considered by the IEP Team.  We decline to add it to the regulations because there are already many opportunities for the IEP Team to consider the affect of emotional issues on a child's learning.  For example, Sec. 300.324(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the strengths of the child; the concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child; the results of the initial evaluation or most recent evaluation of the child; and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child, all of which could be affected by emotional issues and would, therefore, need to be considered by the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested that children with medical conditions that are degenerative be added to the list of special factors considered by the IEP Team.

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include consideration of children with degenerative conditions as a special factor.  We decline to add it to the regulations because we believe that the regulations already address the commenters' concerns.  As with any child with a disability, the child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, determines the special education and related services that are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  For children with degenerative diseases, this may include related services such as physical and occupational therapy (or other services to address the child's needs in the areas of self-help, mobility, and communication) to help maintain the child's present levels of functioning for as long as possible in order for the child to benefit from special education.  In addition, as part of an evaluation or reevaluation, Sec. 300.305 requires the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, to review existing evaluation data on the child to determine the child's needs, which may include evaluations and information from parents, as well as medical professionals who know the child and the child's specific medical condition.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 33, and H. Rpt. No. 108-77, p. 112, recognized the special situations of children with medical conditions that are degenerative (i.e., diseases that result in negative progression and cannot be fully corrected or fully stabilized).  For children with degenerative diseases who are eligible for services under the Act, both reports state that special education and related services can be provided to help maintain the child's present levels of functioning for as long as possible in order for the child to fully benefit from special education services.  The reports also state, "The IEP Team can include related services designed to provide therapeutic services prior to loss of original abilities to extend current skills and throughout the child's enrollment in school.  These services may include occupational and physical therapy, self-help, mobility, and communication, as appropriate."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that permitting changes to a child's IEP without an IEP Team meeting will be detrimental to the child's overall education.  Several commenters requested that Sec. 300.324(a)(4) clarify whether such changes to the IEP can only be made between the annual IEP Team meetings to review the IEP and not in place of an annual IEP Team meeting.  These commenters also requested clarification regarding the types of revisions that could be made without an IEP Team meeting.  A few commenters recommended limiting the circumstances under which an IEP may be revised without convening an IEP Team meeting.  One commenter requested that the regulations include safeguards to ensure that key elements of a child's IEP are not altered without a discussion of the changes with the parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.324(a)(4), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(D) of the Act, allows a parent and a public agency to agree not to convene an IEP Team meeting to make changes to the child's IEP, and instead, to develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  The Act does not place any restrictions on the types of changes that may be made, so long as the parent and the public agency agree.  Accordingly, we do not believe it would be appropriate to include restrictions on such changes in the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe that an amendment to an IEP can take the place of an annual IEP Team meeting.  It is unnecessary to regulate on this issue because section 614(d)(4)(A)(i) of the Act clearly requires the IEP Team to review the child's IEP annually to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved.  We believe that the procedural safeguards in Sec. Sec. 300.500 through 520 are sufficient to ensure that a child's IEP is not changed without prior notice by a public agency and an opportunity to discuss any changes with the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that when an IEP is changed without an IEP Team meeting, all personnel with responsibility for implementing the revised IEP should be informed of the changes with respect to their particular responsibilities and have access to the revised IEP.

Discussion:  We agree that when the parent and the public agency agree to change the IEP without an IEP Team meeting, it is important that the personnel responsible for implementing the revised IEP be notified and informed of the changes with respect to their particular responsibilities.  We will add language to address this in Sec. 300.324(a)(4).  We do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on the timeframe within which a public agency must make the IEP accessible to the service providers responsible for implementing the changes, or otherwise notify them of the changes, as this will vary depending on the circumstances (e.g., whether the changes are minor or major changes) and is, therefore, best left to State and local public agency officials to determine.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested revising Sec. 300.324(a)(6) to require public agencies to provide a copy of a revised IEP to the parent without requiring the parent to request the copy when amendments are made to the IEP.

Discussion:  The requirement for a public agency to provide a parent with a revised copy of the IEP upon the request of a parent is in section 614(d)(3)(F) of the Act.  There is nothing in the Act that would prevent a school from providing a copy of a revised IEP to a parent whenever amendments are made.

Discussion:  To implement the commenters' recommendations would be inconsistent with the Act.

The phrase "at an IEP Team meeting" following "by the entire IEP Team" was inadvertently omitted in Sec. 300.324(a)(6).

Discussion:  Section 300.321(b)(3) requires the IEP Team to invite a representative of any agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services, when appropriate, and with the consent of the parent (or a child who has reached the age of majority).  In addition, Sec. 300.154(a), consistent with section 612(a)(12) of the Act, requires each State to ensure that an interagency agreement or other mechanism for interagency coordination is in effect between each non-educational public agency and the SEA, in order to ensure that services needed to ensure FAPE are provided.  Section 300.154(b) and section 612(a)(12)(B)(i) of the Act specifically refer to interagency agreements or other mechanisms for interagency coordination with agencies assigned responsibility under State policy to provide special education or related services relating to transition.

If an agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP, the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to develop alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the child's IEP, consistent with section 614(d)(6) of the Act and Sec. 300.324(c)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Children with disabilities in adult prisons (Sec. 300.324(d))<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2847%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that guidance is needed regarding what requirements apply when serving incarcerated children with disabilities.  One commenter recommended requiring that children with disabilities incarcerated in local jails continue with their established school schedules and IEP services, which States may provide directly or through an LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  No change to the regulations is needed.  Section 300.324(d)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(7) of the Act, specifies the requirements of the Act that do not apply to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons.  If a child with a disability is incarcerated, but is not convicted as an adult under State law and is not incarcerated in an adult prison, the requirements of the Act apply.  Whether the special education and related services are provided directly by the State or through an LEA is a decision that is best left to States and LEAs to determine.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that SEAs and LEAs should not be allowed to restrict the types of services provided to children with disabilities simply because they are incarcerated.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  The Act allows services to be restricted for a child with a disability who is convicted as an adult under State law and incarcerated in an adult prison.  Section 614(d)(7)(B) of the Act states that the IEP Team of a child with a disability who is convicted as an adult under State law and incarcerated in an adult prison may modify the child's IEP or placement if the State has demonstrated a bona fide security or compelling penological interest that cannot otherwise by accommodated.  Further, the LRE requirements in Sec. 300.114 and the requirements related to transition services in Sec. 300.320 do not apply.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Private school placements by public agencies (Sec. 300.325)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2854%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.325, regarding private school placements by public agencies, is not in the Act and should be removed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  Section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act provides that children with disabilities who are placed in private schools and facilities are provided special education and related services, in accordance with an IEP, and have all the rights the children would have if served by a public agency.  In order to comply with this statutory requirement, Sec. 300.325 explains the responsibilities of the public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility with respect to developing, reviewing, and revising the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested clarifying Sec. 300.325(b)(1), which allows the private school or facility to initiate and conduct IEP Team meetings to review and revise the child's IEP at the discretion of the public agency.  The commenters stated that this should be changed to "only with the consent of the public agency."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the suggested change is necessary.  Section 300.325(c) is clear that for publicly-placed children with disabilities, even if a private school or facility implements a child's IEP, responsibility for compliance with Part B of the Act remains with the public agency and the SEA.  Therefore, it is up to the public agency to determine whether the private school or facility can initiate and conduct an IEP Team meeting to review and revise a child's IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Educational placements (Sec. 300.327)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CD%2C2861%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the terms "educational placement" and "placement" are used throughout the regulations and recommended that only one of the terms be used to avoid confusion.  A few commenters suggested that the term "educational placement" be defined to include location, supports, and services provided. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The terms "educational placement" and "placement" are used throughout the Act, and we have followed the language of the Act whenever possible.  We do not believe it is necessary to define "educational placement."  Section 300.116, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, states that the determination of the educational placement of a child with a disability must be based on a child's IEP.  The Department's longstanding position is that placement refers to the provision of special education and related services rather than a specific place, such as a specific classroom or specific school. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that electronic mail be used as an alternative means of communication for administrative matters if the parents and the public agency agree.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that prohibits the use of electronic mail to carry out administrative matters under section 615 of the Act, so long as the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that video conferences may be used to allow general education teachers to participate in IEP Team meetings.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The regulations already address the use of video conferences.  Section 300.328, consistent with section 614(f) of the Act, allows the use of video conferences and other alternative means of meeting participation if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations specify that the cost of using alternative means of meeting participation shall be borne by the LEA and not the parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a public agency uses an alternative means of meeting participation that results in additional costs, the public agency is responsible for paying the additional costs.  We do not believe it is necessary to include this additional language in the regulations.  Section 300.101, consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act, requires that the public education provided to children with disabilities must be free and appropriate.  The benefits of including parents in the IEP process by providing alternative means by which parents can participate is an important part of ensuring that a child receives FAPE and far outweighs any additional costs for the alternative means of participation that a public agency may incur.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring the parent's agreement to use alternative means of meeting participation to conform to the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(f) of the Act allows the parent and a public agency to agree to use alternative means of meeting participation.  Consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9 is not required by the Act.  Therefore, we do not believe it should be required by regulation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that there be additional requirements when using alternative means of meeting participation.  The commenter stated that parents should be informed of their right to refuse a telephone conference and should be required to provide consent at least seven days prior to the meeting.  Another commenter recommended clarifying that alternative means of meeting should only be used when necessary. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 614(f) of the Act allows a parent and a public agency to agree to use alternative means of meeting participation.  The Act does not specify any additional requirements or restrictions.  We view this provision as providing flexibility for parents and public agencies in arranging convenient meetings and believe that additional requirements would be inconsistent with that purpose. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require LEAs to provide the parent with an IEP in a timely manner (within five business days) when alternative means of meeting participation are used for an IEP Team meeting.  The commenter stated this was necessary so that the parent can verify the contents of the IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New 300.322(f) (proposed Sec. 300.322(e)) requires the public agency to give the parent a copy of the child's IEP at no cost to the parent.  We believe the specific timeframe in which the public agency provides a copy of the IEP to the parent is best left to the public agency to determine.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirements for alternative means of meeting participation in Sec. 300.328 should be placed in the regulations following Sec. 300.321, because the requirements add flexibility to the special education process.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements in Sec. 300.328, regarding alternative means of meeting participation, apply to IEP Team meetings as well as placement meetings, and carrying out administrative matters under section 615 of the Act.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to move Sec. 300.328 to the location in the regulations suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
