Rule of construction (new Sec. 300.18(f)) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A number of commenters stated that the rule of construction in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e))</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
and Sec. 300.156(e) should use the same language.  One commenter stated that in order to prevent confusion, the right of action limitations regarding highly qualified teachers in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)) and personnel qualifications in Sec. 300.156(e) should use consistent language regarding individual and class actions, and clearly underscore that the limitations are applicable to both administrative and judicial actions.  One commenter recommended reiterating the language from section 612(a)(14)(D) of the Act that nothing prevents a parent from filing a State complaint about staff qualifications.  Another commenter expressed concern because new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)) and Sec. 300.156(e) may be construed to prevent due process hearings when an LEA or SEA fails to provide a highly qualified teacher. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the rule of construction in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)) and Sec. 300.156(e) should be the same.  We will change the regulations to clarify that a parent or student may not file a due process complaint on behalf of a student, or file a judicial action on behalf of a class of students for the failure of a particular SEA or LEA employee to be highly qualified; however, a parent may file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA.  In addition to permitting a parent to file a complaint with the SEA, an organization or an individual may also file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, consistent with the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added "or to prevent a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA as provided for under this part" in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations specify that the failure of an SEA or LEA to provide a child with a disability a highly qualified teacher can be a consideration in the determination of whether a child received FAPE, if the child is not learning the core content standards or not meeting IEP goals.  However, a few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that it is not a denial of FAPE if a special education teacher is not highly qualified.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If the only reason a parent believes their child was denied FAPE is that the child did not have a highly qualified teacher, the parent would have no right of action under the Act on that basis.  The rules of construction in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)) and Sec. 300.156(e) do not allow a parent or student to file a due process complaint for failure of an LEA or SEA to provide a highly qualified teacher.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern with the rule of construction in new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)) because there are no requirements to develop a specific enforcement system to ensure that teachers meet the highly qualified standard.  A few commenters recommended changing the rule of construction so that States meet their supervisory responsibilities under the Act if LEAs in the State are sanctioned under the ESEA for not having highly qualified teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Some commenters recommended clarifying that when the SEA or LEA employs an individual who is not highly qualified, States meet their responsibilities for general supervision under the Act through the notice and other sanction procedures identified under the ESEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that the regulations are silent with regard to SEA actions when meeting the general supervision requirements under the Act, and noted that unless the regulations are expanded to clarify that SEA enforcement procedures under compliance monitoring are limited to ESEA enforcement procedures, the highly qualified teacher requirements of an individual teacher may inappropriately become the target for a finding of noncompliance.  This commenter further stated that the ESEA contains specific procedures for failure of a district to comply with the highly qualified teacher provisions, and if the SEA also exercises sanctioning authority under the Act, schools could be punished twice under two separate provisions of Federal law for the same infraction.  The commenter recommended that to avoid double jeopardy the regulations should clarify that the ESEA enforcement procedures for a district's failure to hire a highly qualified teacher follow the provisions of the ESEA, not the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The implementation and enforcement of the highly qualified teacher standards under the ESEA and the Act complement each other.  The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) currently monitors the implementation of the highly qualified teacher standards for teachers of core academic subjects under the ESEA.  This includes special education teachers who teach core academic subjects.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Office of Special Education programs (OSEP) collects data about special education personnel qualifications and requires that SEAs establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel essential to carrying out the purposes of Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Those personnel must also have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities, consistent with Sec. 300.156.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	OESE and OSEP will share their data to ensure that the highly qualified teacher requirements under the ESEA and the Act are met.  This sharing of information will also prevent schools from being punished twice for the same infraction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
