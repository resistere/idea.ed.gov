Parent (Sec. 300.30)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters objected to the term "natural parent" in the definition of parent because "natural parent" presumes there are "unnatural parents."  The commenters recommended using "birth parent" or "biological parent" throughout the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We understand that many people find the term "natural parent" offensive.  We will, therefore, use the term "biological parent" to refer to a non-adoptive parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have replaced the term "natural parent" with "biological parent" in the definition of parent and throughout these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A significant number of commenters recommended retaining the language in current Sec. 300.20(b), which states that a foster parent can act as a parent if the biological parent's authority to make educational decisions on the child's behalf have been extinguished under State law, and the foster parent has an ongoing, long-term parental relationship with the child; is willing to make the educational decisions required of parents under the Act; and has no interest that would conflict with the interest of the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters stated that current Sec. 300.20(b) better protects children's interests and should not be removed.  Another commenter stated that removing current Sec. 300.20 will have unintended consequences for the many foster children who move frequently to new homes because there will be confusion as to who has parental rights under the Act.  A few commenters stated that short-term foster parents may not have the knowledge of the child or the willingness to actively participate in the special education process, which will effectively leave the child without a parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that Sec. 300.30 needs to be changed to protect biological and adoptive parents from arbitrary decisions by educational officials who lack the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child and to ensure that when no biological or adoptive parent is available, a person with a long-term relationship with, and commitment to, the child has decision-making authority.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Congress changed the definition of parent in the Act.  The definition of parent in these regulations reflects the revised statutory definition of parent in section 602(23) of the Act.  The Department understands the concerns expressed by the commenters, but believes that the changes requested would not be consistent with the intent of the statutory changes.  In changing the definition of parent in the Act, Congress incorporated some of the wording from the current regulations and did not incorporate in the new definition of parent, the current foster parent language referenced by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended allowing a foster parent who does not have a long-term relationship to be the parent, if a court, after notifying all interested parties, determines that it is in the best interest of the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(2) clearly states that if a person is specified in a judicial order or decree to act as the parent for purposes of Sec. 300.30, that person would be considered the parent under Part B of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.30(a)(2) withdraws the rights of biological parents under the Act without due process of law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree with the commenter.  If more than one person is attempting to act as a parent, Sec. 300.30(b)(1) provides that the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent if that person is attempting to act as the parent under Sec. 300.30, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child, or there is a judicial order or decree specifying some other person to act as a parent under Part B of the Act.  We do not believe that provisions regarding lack of legal authority or judicial orders or decrees would apply unless there has already been a determination, through appropriate legal processes, that the biological parent should not make educational decisions for the child or that another person has been ordered to serve as the parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.30(a)(2) is unwieldy and difficult to implement because it requires extensive fact finding by the LEA to determine whether any contractual obligations would prohibit the foster parent from acting as a parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The statutory language concerning the definition of parent was changed to permit foster parents to be considered a child's parent, unless State law prohibits a foster parent from serving as a parent.  The language in the regulations also recognizes that similar restrictions may exist in State regulations or in contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent, and should be accorded similar deference.  We believe it is essential for LEAs to have knowledge of State laws, regulations, and any contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent to ensure that the requirements in Sec. 300.30(a)(2) are properly implemented.  States and LEAs should develop procedures to make this information more readily and easily available so that LEAs do not have to engage in extensive fact finding each time a child with a foster parent enrolls in a school.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the regulations need to clarify that guardians ad litem do not meet the definition of a parent except for wards of the State where consent for the initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child in the educational decisions concerning the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that guardians with limited appointments that do not qualify them to act as a parent of the child generally, or do not authorize them to make educational decisions for the child, should not be considered to be a parent within the meaning of these regulations.  What is important is the legal authority granted to individuals appointed by a court, and not the term used to identify them.  Whether a person appointed as a guardian ad litem has the requisite authority to be considered a parent under this section depends on State law and the nature of the person's appointment.  We will revise Sec. 300.30(a)(3) to clarify that a guardian must be authorized to act as the child's parent generally or must be authorized to make educational decisions for the child in order to fall within the definition of parent. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.30(a)(3) to clarify when a guardian can be considered a parent under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested adding a "temporary parent" appointed in accordance with sections 615(b)(2) or 639(a)(5) of the Act to the definition of parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that would prevent a temporary surrogate parent from having all the rights of a parent.  Note 89 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 35810, provides that appropriate staff members of emergency shelters, transitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach programs would not be considered to be employees of agencies involved in the education or care of unaccompanied youth (and thus prohibited from serving as a surrogate parent), provided that such a role is temporary until a surrogate parent can be appointed who meets the requirements for a surrogate parent in Sec. 300.519(d).  This provision is included in Sec. 300.519(f), regarding surrogate parents.  Therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to add "temporary parent" to the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that the definition of parent is confusing, especially in light of the definition of ward of the State in new Sec. 300.45 (proposed Sec. 300.44) and the LEA's obligation to appoint a surrogate parent.  These commenters stated that Sec. 300.30 should cross-reference the definition of ward of the State in new Sec. 300.45 (proposed Sec. 300.44) and state that the appointed surrogate parent for a child who is a ward of the State is the parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(b)(2) of the Act does not require the automatic appointment of a surrogate parent for every child with a disability who is a ward of the State.  States and LEAs must ensure that the rights of these children are protected and that a surrogate parent is appointed, if necessary, as provided in Sec. 300.519(b)(1).  If a child who is a ward of the State already has a person who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30, and that person is willing and able to assume the responsibilities of a parent under the Act, a surrogate parent might not be needed.  Accordingly, we do not believe it is necessary to make the changes suggested by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that public agencies will require biological or adoptive parents to affirmatively assert their rights or to take action in order to be presumed to be the parent.  The commenter requested clarifying in Sec. 300.30(b)(1) that biological or adoptive parents do not have to take affirmative steps in order for the presumption to apply.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The biological or adoptive parent would be presumed to be the parent under these regulations, unless a question was raised about their legal authority.  There is nothing in the Act that requires the biological or adoptive parent to affirmatively assert their rights to be presumed to be the parent.  We continue to believe that Sec. 300.30(b)(1) is clear and, therefore, will not make the changes requested by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing "when attempting to act as a parent under this part" in Sec. 300.30(b)(1).  A few commenters stated that there is no explanation of what it means for a biological parent to "attempt to act as a parent."  Another commenter stated that the regulations do not set any guidelines for determining how a public agency decides if a biological or adoptive parent is attempting to act as a parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated "attempting to act" would require LEAs to make determinations about a biological parent's decision-making authority and this should be left up to courts to determine.  One commenter stated that the regulations permit multiple persons to act as a child's parent and do not adequately set forth a process to determine who should be identified as the actual parent for decision-making purposes.  The commenter further stated that the regulations do not set out a procedure or a timeframe by which public agency officials should determine if a biological parent has retained the right to make educational decisions for his or her child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that the definition of parent gives school districts excessive power; for example a school could appoint a surrogate parent if the foster parent was excessively demanding.  The commenter further stated that a clearer order of priority and selection mechanism with judicial oversight needs to be in place so that school districts cannot "parent shop" for the least assertive individual, and so that relatives, foster parents, social workers, and others involved with the child will know who has educational decision making authority.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter questioned whether Sec. 300.30(b) helps identify parents or confuses situations in which the person to be designated the parent is in dispute.  Another commenter stated that the requirements in Sec. 300.30(b) place the responsibility of determining who serves as the parent of a child in foster care directly on the shoulders of school administrators who are not child welfare experts.  The commenter recommended that a foster parent automatically qualify as a parent when the rights of the child's biological parents have been extinguished and the foster parent has a long-term relationship with the child, no conflict of interest, and is willing to make educational decisions.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b) was added to assist schools and public agencies in determining the appropriate person to serve as the parent under Part B of the Act in those difficult situations in which more than one individual is "attempting to act as a parent" and make educational decisions for a child.  It recognizes the priority of the biological or adoptive parent and the authority of the courts to make decisions, and does not leave these decisions to school administrators.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The phrase "attempting to act as a parent" is generally meant to refer to situations in which an individual attempts to assume the responsibilities of a parent under the Act.  An individual may "attempt to act as a parent" under the Act in many situations; for example, if an individual provides consent for an evaluation or reevaluation, or attends an IEP Team meeting as the child's parent.  We do not believe it is necessary or possible to include in these regulations the numerous situations in which an individual may "attempt to act as a parent."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.30(b)(1) provides that the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent if that person is attempting to act as the parent under Sec. 300.30, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child, or there is a judicial order or decree specifying some other person to act as a parent under Part B of the Act.  Section 300.30(b)(2) provides that if a person (or persons) is specified in a judicial order or decree to act as the parent for purposes of Sec. 300.30, that person would be the parent under Part B of the Act.  We do not believe that it is necessary for these regulations to establish procedures or a timeline for a public agency to determine whether a biological parent has retained the right to make educational decisions for a child.  Such procedures and timelines will vary depending on how judicial orders or decrees are routinely handled in a State or locality, and are best left to State and local officials to determine.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended modifying Sec. 300.30(b)(2) to clarify that a court has the discretion to decide who has the right to make educational decisions for a child.  One commenter recommended clarifying that the judicial decree referred to in Sec. 300.30(b)(2) relates specifically to divorce situations, rather than situations involving children who are wards of the State.  Another commenter stated that Sec. 300.30(b)(2) appears to be aimed at situations where the court has designated a parent, such as in a custody decree, and that it is not clear what the provision adds.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(2) specifically states that if a judicial decree or order identifies a person or persons to act as the parent of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child, then that person would be determined to be the parent.  It was intended to add clarity about who would be designated a parent when there are competing individuals under Sec. 300.30(a)(1) through (4) who could be considered a parent for purposes of this part.  It is not necessary to specify or limit this language to provide that the judicial decree or order applies to specific situations, such as divorce or custody cases.  However, it should not authorize courts to appoint individuals other than those identified in Sec. 300.30(a)(1) through (4) to act as parents under this part.  Specific authority for court appointment of individuals to provide consent for initial evaluations in limited circumstances is in Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(c).  Authority for court appointment of a surrogate parent in certain situations is in Sec. 300.519(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised Sec. 300.30(b)(2) to limit its application to individuals identified under Sec. 300.30(a)(1) through (4) and have deleted the phrase "except that a public agency that provides education or care for the child may not act as the parent" as unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended allowing foster parents to act as parents only when the birth parent's rights have been extinguished or terminated.  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify the circumstances under which a foster parent can take over educational decision making.  One commenter stated that allowing a foster parent to act as a parent would disrupt the special education process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under Sec. 300.30(a)(2), a foster parent can be considered a parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from acting as a parent.  However, in cases where a foster parent and a biological or adoptive parent attempt to act as the parent, Sec. 300.30(b)(1) clarifies that the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.  Section 300.30(b)(2) further clarifies that if a person or persons such as a foster parent or foster parents is specified in a judicial order or decree to act as the parent for purposes of Sec. 300.30, that person would be the parent under Part B of the Act.  We do not believe that further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that "extinguished under State law" be defined to mean both temporary and permanent termination of parental rights to make educational decisions because this would allow courts to make more timely decisions regarding the role of a parent and not feel bound to wait for a full termination of parental rights.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The phrase "extinguished under State law" is not used in the Act or these regulations.  The phrase was used in the definition of parent in current Sec. 300.20(b)(1).  The comparable provision in these regulations is in Sec. 300.30(b)(1), which refers to situations in which the "biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child."

Comment:  One commenter stated that it would not be wise to completely exclude an agency involved in the education or care of the child from serving as a parent because situations in which an LEA acts as a parent are very rare and only occur under very unusual circumstances.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The exclusion of an agency involved in the education or care of the child from serving as a parent is consistent with the statutory prohibition that applies to surrogate parents in sections 615(b)(2) and 639(a)(5) of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify the responsibilities of the LEA when a biological or adoptive parent and a foster parent attempt to act as the parent.  Although the regulations state that the biological or adoptive parent must be presumed to be the parent unless the biological or adoptive parent has been divested of this authority by a court, the commenter stated that the regulations are not clear as to whether the LEA has the duty to notify the biological or adoptive parent, accommodate his or her schedule, or otherwise take steps to facilitate the biological or adoptive parent's participation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended clarifying the relative rights of a biological or adoptive parent and a foster parent when a child is in foster care and the foster parent is not prohibited by the State from acting as a parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(1) states that when more than one party is qualified under Sec. 300.30(a) to act as the parent, the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent (unless a judicial decree or order identifies a specific person or persons to act as the parent of a child).  The biological or adoptive parent has all the rights and responsibilities of a parent under the Act, and the LEA must provide notice to the parent, accommodate his or her schedule when arranging meetings, and involve the biological or adoptive parent in the education of the child with a disability.  Thus, if a child is in foster care (and the foster parent is not prohibited by the State from acting as a parent) and the biological or adoptive parent is attempting to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child or a judicial decree or order identifies a specific person or persons to act as the parent of a child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that it is unclear when or under what circumstances a biological or adoptive parent ceases or surrenders their rights to a foster parent to make educational decisions for a child.  One commenter stated that the regulations should define clearly the situations when this would occur and the level of proof that must be shown by the party seeking to make educational decisions on behalf of a child.  The commenter stated that only under the most extreme and compelling circumstances should a court be able to appoint another individual to take the place of a biological or adoptive parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inappropriate and beyond the authority of the Department to regulate on the termination of parental rights to make educational decisions.  It is the responsibility of a court to decide whether to appoint another person or persons to act as a parent of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarifying to whom LEAs must provide notice, or obtain consent in situations where there are disputes between biological or adoptive parents (e.g., when parents separate or divorce).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In situations where the parents of a child are divorced, the parental rights established by the Act apply to both parents, unless a court order or State law specifies otherwise.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying in the regulations that a private agency that contracts with a public agency for the education or care of the child may not act as a parent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  A private agency that contracts with a public agency for the education or care of the child, in essence, works for the public agency, and therefore, could not act as a parent under the Act.  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate on this matter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
