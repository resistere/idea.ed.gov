Appendix A to Part 300--Excess Costs Calculation

    Except as otherwise provided, amounts provided to an LEA under 
Part B of the Act may be used only to pay the excess costs of 
providing special education and related services to children with 
disabilities. Excess costs are those costs for the education of an 
elementary school or secondary school student with a disability that 
are in excess of the average annual per student expenditure in an 
LEA during the preceding school year for an elementary school or 
secondary school student, as may be appropriate. An LEA must spend 
at least the average annual per student expenditure on the education 
of an elementary school or secondary school child with a disability 
before funds under Part B of the Act are used to pay the excess 
costs of providing special education and related services.
    Section 602(8) of the Act and Sec.  300.16 require the LEA to 
compute the minimum average amount separately for children with 
disabilities in its elementary schools and for children with 
disabilities in its secondary schools. LEAs may not compute the 
minimum average amount it must spend on the education of children 
with disabilities based on a combination of the enrollments in its 
elementary schools and secondary schools.
    The following example shows how to compute the minimum average 
amount an LEA must spend for the education of each of its elementary 
school children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the Act 
before it may use funds under Part B of the Act.
    a. First the LEA must determine the total amount of its 
expenditures for elementary school students from all sources--local, 
State, and Federal (including Part B)--in the preceding school year. 
Only capital outlay and debt services are excluded.

    Example: The following is an example of a computation for 
children with disabilities enrolled in an LEA's elementary schools. 
In this example, the LEA had an average elementary school enrollment 
for the preceding school year of 800 (including 100 children with 
disabilities). The LEA spent the following amounts last year for 
elementary school students (including its elementary school children 
with disabilities):




(1)....................  From State and local tax funds.      $6,500,000
(2)....................   From Federal funds............         600,000
                                                         ---------------
                          Total expenditures............       7,100,000


    Of this total, $60,000 was for capital outlay and debt service 
relating to the education of elementary school students. This must 
be subtracted from total expenditures.




(1)....................  Total Expenditures.............      $7,100,000
(2)....................  Less capital outlay and debt...         -60,000
                                                         ===============
                          Total expenditures for              $7,040,000
                          elementary school students
                          less capital outlay and debt.


    b. Next, the LEA must subtract from the total expenditures 
amounts spent for:
    (1) IDEA, Part B allocation,
    (2) ESEA, Title I, Part A allocation,
    (3) ESEA, Title III, Parts A and B allocation,
    (4) State and local funds for children with disabilities, and
    (5) State or local funds for programs under ESEA, Title I, Part 
A, and Title III, Parts A and B.
    These are funds that the LEA actually spent, not funds received 
last year but carried over for the current school year.

    Example: The LEA spent the following amounts for elementary 
school students last year:




(1)....................  From funds under IDEA, Part B         $ 200,000
                          allocation.
(2)....................  From funds under ESEA, Title I,         250,000
                          Part A allocation.
(3)....................  From funds under ESEA, Title             50,000
                          III, Parts A and B allocation.
(4)....................  From State funds and local              500,000
                          funds for children with
                          disabilities.
(5)....................  From State and local funds for          150,000
                          programs under ESEA, Title I,
                          Part A, and Title III, Parts A
                          and B.
                                                         ---------------
                          Total.........................       1,150,000
                                                         ---------------
(1)....................   Total expenditures less              7,040,000
                          capital outlay and debt.
(2)....................  Other deductions...............      -1,150,000
                                                         ===============
                          Total.........................      $5,890,000


    c. Except as otherwise provided, the LEA next must determine the 
average annual per

[[Page 46814]]

student expenditure for its elementary schools dividing the average 
number of students enrolled in the elementary schools of the agency 
during the preceding year (including its children with disabilities) 
into the amount computed under the above paragraph. The amount 
obtained through this computation is the minimum amount the LEA must 
spend (on the average) for the education of each of its elementary 
school children with disabilities. Funds under Part B of the Act may 
be used only for costs over and above this minimum.




(1)....................  Amount from Step b.............      $5,890,000
(2)....................  Average number of students                  800
                          enrolled.
(3)....................  $5,890,000/800 Average annual           $ 7,362
                          per student expenditure.


    d. Except as otherwise provided, to determine the total minimum 
amount of funds the LEA must spend for the education of its 
elementary school children with disabilities in the LEA (not 
including capital outlay and debt service), the LEA must multiply 
the number of elementary school children with disabilities in the 
LEA times the average annual per student expenditure obtained in 
paragraph c above. Funds under Part B of the Act can only be used 
for excess costs over and above this minimum.




(1)....................   Number of children with                    100
                          disabilities in the LEA's
                          elementary schools.
(2)....................  Average annual per student              $ 7,362
                          expenditure.
(3)....................  $7,362 x 100...................
                          Total minimum amount of funds        $ 736,200
                          the LEA must spend for the
                          education of children with
                          disabilities enrolled in the
                          LEA's elementary schools
                          before using Part B funds.


Appendix B to Part 300--Proportionate Share Calculation

    Each LEA must expend, during the grant period, on the provision 
of special education and related services for the parentally-placed 
private school children with disabilities enrolled in private 
elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA an 
amount that is equal to--
    (1) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 
611(f) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21. 
This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total 
subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act as the number of 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 
through 21 enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary 
schools located in the LEA is to the total number of children with 
disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools and 
secondary schools located in the LEA aged 3 through 21; and
    (2) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 
619(g) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. 
This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total 
subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the total number of 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5 enrolled in private elementary schools located in the LEA 
is to the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in 
public and private elementary schools located in the LEA aged 3 
through 5.
    Consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act and Sec.  
300.133 of these regulations, annual expenditures for parentally-
placed private school children with disabilities are calculated 
based on the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in 
public and private elementary schools and secondary schools located 
in the LEA eligible to receive special education and related 
services under Part B, as compared with the total number of eligible 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled 
in private elementary schools located in the LEA. This ratio is used 
to determine the proportion of the LEA's total Part B subgrants 
under section 611(f) of the Act for children aged 3 through 21, and 
under section 619(g) of the Act for children aged 3 through 5, that 
is to be expended on services for parentally-placed private school 
children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools 
and secondary schools located in the LEA.
    The following is an example of how the proportionate share is 
calculated:
    There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in 
the Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed 
private school children with disabilities enrolled in private 
elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA for a 
total of 320 eligible public and private school children with 
disabilities (note: proportionate share for parentally-placed 
private school children is based on total children eligible, not 
children served). The number of eligible parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities (20) divided by the total number 
of eligible public and private school children with disabilities 
(320) indicates that 6.25 percent of the LEA's subgrant must be 
spent for the group of eligible parentally-placed children with 
disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary 
schools located in the LEA. Flintstone School District receives 
$152,500 in Federal flow through funds. Therefore, the LEA must 
spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the 
group of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities 
enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located 
in the LEA. (Note: The LEA must calculate the proportionate share of 
IDEA funds before earmarking funds for any early intervening 
activities in Sec.  300.226).
    The following outlines the calculations for the example of how 
the proportionate share is calculated.

Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility 
Standard (NIMAS)

    Under sections 612(a)(23)(A) and 674(e)(4) of the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act, as amended by the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the Secretary of 
Education establishes the NIMAS. Under section 674(e)(4) of the Act, 
the NIMAS applies to print instructional materials published after 
July 19, 2006. The purpose of the NIMAS is to help increase the 
availability and timely delivery of print instructional materials in 
accessible formats to blind or other persons with print disabilities 
in elementary and secondary schools.

Technical Specifications--The Baseline Element Set

    The Baseline Element Set details the minimum requirement that 
must be delivered to fulfill the NIMAS. It is the responsibility of 
publishers to provide this NIMAS-conformant XML content file, a 
package file (OPF), a PDF-format copy of the title page (or 
whichever page(s) contain(s) ISBN and copyright information), and a 
full set of the content's images. All of the images included within 
a work must be provided in a folder and placeholders entered in the 
relevant XML document indicating their location (all images must be 
included). The preferred image type is SVG, next is either PNG or 
JPG format. Images should be rendered in the same size/proportion as 
their originals at 300 dpi. Images should be named with relative 
path filenames in XML files (example: img id=``staricon4'' src=``./
images/U10C02/staricon4.jpg'' alt=``star icon'').
    NIMAS-conformant content must be valid to the NIMAS 1.1 [see 
ANSI/NISO Z39.86 2005 or subsequent revisions]. In addition, files 
are required to use the tags from the Baseline Element Set when such 
tags are appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to augment the 
required Baseline Element Set with tags from the Optional Element 
Set (elements not included in the Standard) as applicable. For the 
purposes of NIMAS, appropriate usage of elements, both baseline

[[Page 46815]]

and optional, is defined by the DAISY Structure Guidelines. Files 
that do not follow these guidelines in the selection and application 
of tags are not conformant to this Standard. Both optional elements 
and appropriate structure guidelines may be located within Z39.86-
2002 and Z39.86-2005 available from <a href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/">http:www.daisy.org/z3986/</a>. Use 

of the most current standard is recommended.

                                     material that is often enclosed in
                                     appropriate &lt;level> or &lt;level1>
                                     etc. Content may include a
                                     copyright notice, a foreword, an
                                     acknowledgements section, a table
                                     of contents, etc. &lt;frontmatter>
                                     serves as a guide to the content
                                     and nature of a &lt;book>.
bodymatter........................  Consists of the text proper of a
                                     book, as contrasted with
                                     preliminary material &lt;frontmatter>
                                     or supplementary information in
                                     &lt;rearmatter>.
rearmatter........................  Contains supplementary material such
                                     as appendices, glossaries,
                                     bibliographies, and indices. It
                                     follows the &lt;bodymatter> of the
                                     book.
level1............................  The highest-level container of major
                                     divisions of a book. Used in
                                     &lt;frontmatter>, &lt;bodymatter>, and
                                     &lt;rearmatter> to mark the largest
                                     divisions of the book (usually
                                     parts or chapters), inside which
                                     &lt;level2> subdivisions (often
                                     sections) may nest. The class
                                     attribute identifies the actual
                                     name (e.g., part, chapter) of the
                                     structure it marks. Contrast with

                                     actual name (e.g., subpart,
                                     chapter, subsection) of the
                                     structure it marks.
level3............................  Contains sub-subdivisions that nest
                                     within &lt;level2> subdivisions (e.g.,

                                     subsections). The class attribute
                                     identifies the actual name (e.g.,
                                     section, subpart, subsubsection) of
                                     the subordinate structure it marks.
level4............................  Contains further subdivisions that
                                     nest within &lt;level3> subdivisions.
                                     The class attribute identifies the
                                     actual name of the subordinate
                                     structure it marks.
level5............................  Contains further subdivisions that
                                     nest within &lt;level4> subdivisions.
                                     The class attribute identifies the

                                     structure it marks.
level6............................  Contains further subdivisions that
                                     nest within &lt;level5> subdivisions.
                                     The class attribute identifies the
                                     actual name of the subordinate

                                     bullets and outline enumerations
                                     are part of the print content, they
                                     are expected to prefix those list
                                     items in content, rather than be
                                     implicitly generated.
li................................  Marks each list item in a &lt;list>.
                                     &lt;li> content may be either inline

                                     preceding &lt;dt> has no semantic
                                     interpretation, but is visually
                                     presented aligned with other &lt;dd>.

                                     containing that &lt;table>indicated
                                     on the page where it starts. Note
                                     the logical order of optional
                                     &lt;thead>, optional &lt;tfoot>, then one
                                     or more of either &lt;tbody> or just
                                     rows &lt;tr>. This order accommodates
                                     simple or large, complex tables.
                                     The &lt;thead>and &lt;tfoot>information
                                     usually helps identify content of
                                     the &lt;tbody> rows. For a multiple-
                                     page print &lt;table>the &lt;thead>and
                                     &lt;tfoot>are repeated on each page,
                                     but not redundantly tagged.
td................................  Indicates a table cell containing
                                     data.
tr................................  Marks one row of a &lt;table>containing &lt;th>or &lt;td>cells. For the most current usage guidelines, please refer to <a href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/</a> 

Images ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
imggroup.......................... Provides a container for one or more &lt;img> 
                                     and associated &lt;caption>(s)
                                     and &lt;prodnote>(s). A &lt;prodnote> may
                                     contain a description of the image.
                                     The content model allows: 1)
                                     multiple &lt;img> if they share a
                                     caption, with the ids of each &lt;img>
                                     in the &lt; caption imgref=``id1 id2
                                     ...''&gt;, 2) multiple &lt;caption> if
                                     several captions refer to a single
                                     &lt;img id=``xxx''&gt; where each caption
                                     has the same &lt; caption
                                     imgref=``xxx''&gt;, 3) multiple
                                     &lt;prodnote> if different versions
                                     are needed for different media
                                     (e.g., large print, braille, or
                                     print). If several &lt;prodnote> refer
                                     to a single &lt;img id=``xxx''>, each
                                     prodnote has the same &lt; prodnote
                                     imgref=``xxx''&gt;.
img...............................  Points to the image to be rendered.
                                     An &lt;img> may stand alone or be
                                     grouped using &lt;imggroup>. Note that
                                     providing extracted images is not a
                                     requirement of the NIMAS. If they
                                     are included, it is best to refer
                                     to them using &lt;img> within the
                                     &lt;imggroup> container.
caption...........................  Describes a &lt;table>or &lt;img>. If
                                     used with &lt;table>it must follow
                                     immediately after the &lt;table>start
                                     tag. If used with &lt;imggroup> it is
                                     not so constrained.
                                    For the most current usage
                                     guidelines, please refer to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/</a>



1. The Optional Elements and Guidelines for Use

    Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline 
(required) elements. The complete DTBook Element Set reflects the 
tags necessary to create the six types of Digital Talking Books and 
Braille output. Because of the present necessity to subdivide the 
creation of alternate format materials into distinct phases, the 
Panel determined that baseline elements would be provided by 
publishers, and optional elements would be added to the NIMAS-
conformant files by third party conversion entities. In both 
circumstances the protocols for tagging digital files should conform 
to the most current ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification. Content 
converters are directed to the most current DAISY Structure 
Guidelines (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/</a>) for guidance on their use.

    Since the publication of the original National File Format 
report from which the NIMAS technical specifications were derived, 
ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 was updated and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005. 
It may be best to avoid using the following optional elements which 
are no longer included in ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005: style, notice, hr, 
and levelhd.
    Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86-2005 and should be considered optional elements for the 
NIMAS: bridgehead, byline, covertitle, dateline, epigraph, 
linegroup, and poem. Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 for 
additional information regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/
NISO Z39.86-2005 specification, go to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.daisy.org/z3986/</a>.


2. Package File

    A package file describes a publication. It identifies all other 
files in the publication and provides descriptive and access 
information about them. A publication must include a package file 
conforming to the NIMAS. The package file is based on the

[[Page 46817]]

Open eBook Publication Structure 1.2 package file specification (For 
most recent detail please see <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2</a>
). A NIMAS package file must 

be an XML-valid OeB PS 1.2 package file instance and must meet the 
following additional standards:
    The NIMAS Package File must include the following Dublin Core 
(dc:)metadata:
dc:Title.
dc:Creator (if applicable).
dc:Publisher.
dc:Date (Date of NIMAS-compliant file creation--yyyy-mm-dd).
dc:Format (=``NIMAS 1.0'').
dc:Identifier (a unique identifier for the NIMAS-compliant digital 
publication, e.g., print ISBN + ``-NIMAS''--exact format to be 
determined).
dc:Language (one instance, or multiple in the case of a foreign 
language textbook, etc.).
dc:Rights (details to be determined).
dc:Source (ISBN of print version of textbook).

    And the following x-metadata items:
nimas-SourceEdition (the edition of the print textbook).
nimas-SourceDate (date of publication of the print textbook).

    The following metadata were proposed also as a means of 
facilitating recordkeeping, storage and file retrieval:
dc:Subject (Lang Arts, Soc Studies, etc.).
nimas-grade (specific grade level of the print textbook, e.g.; Grade 
6).
nimas gradeRange (specific grade range of the print textbook, e.g.; 
Grades 4-5).

    An additional suggestion references the use of:

dc:audience:educationLevel (for the grade and gradeRange 
identifiers, noting that Dublin Core recommends using educationLevel 
with an appropriate controlled vocabulary for context, and 
recommends the U.S. Department of Education's Level of Education 
vocabulary online at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.ed.gov/admin/reference/index.jsp">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.ed.gov/admin/reference/index.jsp</a>. 

Using educationLevel obviates the need for a separate field for 
gradeRange since dc elements can repeat more than once. A book used 
in more than one grade would therefore have two elements, one with 
value ``Grade 4'' and another with value ``Grade 5.''

    A final determination as to which of these specific metadata 
elements to use needs to be clarified in practice. The package 
manifest must list all provided files (text, images, etc.).
(Note: For purposes of continuity and to minimize errors in 
transformation and processing, the NIMAS-compliant digital text 
should be provided as a single document.)

3. Modular Extensions

    The most current DAISY/NISO standard, formally the ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86, Specifications for the Digital Talking Book defines a 
comprehensive system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of 
this standard is DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a core set 
of elements needed to produce most types of books. However, DTBook 
is not intended to be an exhaustive vocabulary for all types of 
books.
    Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO 
standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing, 
workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of 
the extensions that have been discussed.

Appendix D to Part 300--Maintenance of Effort and Early Intervening 
Services

    LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in 
accordance with Sec.  300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds 
for early intervening services under Sec.  300.226 must do so with 
caution because the local maintenance of effort reduction provision 
and the authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services 
are interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes about the amount 
of funds that it uses for one purpose affect the amount that it may 
use for the other. Below are examples that illustrate how Sec. Sec.  
300.205(d) and 300.226(a) affect one another.
    Example 1: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the 
LEA's total grant (see Sec.  300.226(a)), which is the maximum 
amount that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is 
greater than the amount that may be used for local maintenance of 
effort (MOE) reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's 
grant from the prior year's grant) (see Sec.  300.205(a)).




Prior Year's Allocation.................................       $900,000.
Current Year's Allocation...............................      1,000,000.
Increase................................................        100,000.
Maximum Available for MOE Reduction.....................         50,000.
Maximum Available for EIS...............................        150,000.


    If the LEA chooses to set aside $150,000 for EIS, it may not 
reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $150,000 for EIS means $0 
can be used for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $100,000 for EIS, it may not 
reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $100,000 for EIS means $0 
can be used for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $50,000 for EIS, it may not 
reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $50,000 for EIS means $0 
can be used for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $30,000 for EIS, it may reduce 
its MOE by $20,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $30,000 for EIS means 
$20,000 can be used for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $0 for EIS, it may reduce its 
MOE by $50,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $0 for EIS means $50,000 
can be used for MOE).
    Example 2: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the 
LEA's total grant (see Sec.  300.226(a)), which is the maximum 
amount that the LEA may use for EIS, is less than the amount that 
may be used for MOE reduction (50 percent of the increase in the 
LEA's grant from the prior year's grant) (see Sec.  300.205(a)).




Prior Year's Allocation.................................     $1,000,000.
Current Year's Allocation...............................      2,000,000.
Increase................................................      1,000,000.
Maximum Available for MOE Reduction.....................        500,000.
Maximum Available for EIS...............................        300,000.


    If the LEA chooses to use no funds for MOE, it may set aside 
$300,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $0 means $300,000 for 
EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $100,000 for MOE, it may set aside 
$200,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $100,000 means $200,000 
for EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $150,000 for MOE, it may set aside 
$150,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $150,000 means $150,000 
for EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $300,000 for MOE, it may not set aside 
anything for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $300,000 means $0 for 
EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $500,000 for MOE, it may not set aside 
anything for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $500,000 means $0 for 
EIS).
