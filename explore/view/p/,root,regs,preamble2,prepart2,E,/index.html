Opportunity to examine records; parent participation in meetings (Sec. 300.501)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CE%2C2888%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language in Sec. 300.501(a) stating that parents have the right to obtain a free copy of all education records.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.501(a), consistent with section 615(b)(1) of the Act, affords parents an opportunity to inspect and review all education records with respect to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child, and the provision of FAPE to the child.  Specific procedures for access to records are contained in the confidentiality provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.613 through 300.621.  A participating agency, consistent with Sec. 300.613(b)(2), however, must provide copies of a child's education records to a parent, if failure to do so would effectively prevent a parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the records, such as if a parent lives outside of commuting distance of the agency.  This provision is consistent with the access rights afforded under FERPA in 34 CFR 99.10(d)(1).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We decline to make the change requested by the commenter because such a change would impose a significant new burden on public agencies that is not necessary.  Public agencies, however, are free to provide copies whenever requested by the parent, if they choose to do so.  We have, however, made a change to this section to correct the cross-references to the procedures for inspection and review of records.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have corrected the cross-references to the procedures for inspection and review of records to Sec. Sec. 300.613 through 300.621. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding a provision to Sec. 300.501 that would give parents the opportunity to prepare their own reports and provide information that would become part of the child's education record.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters suggested adding language in Sec. 300.501(b)(2) requiring the public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that parents understand the proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  The commenters stated that this requirement is not unnecessarily duplicative and removing it gives the impression that interpreters are no longer required.  Several commenters recommended that if school staff determines that a parent has difficulty understanding the procedural safeguards, the public agency must explain the parent's rights at any time that a change in services is contemplated.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language to Sec. 300.501(b)(2) to require a public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that parents understand the proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  Public agencies are required by other Federal statutes to take appropriate actions to ensure that parents who themselves have disabilities and limited English proficient parents understand proceedings at any of the meetings described in this section.  The other Federal statutory provisions that apply in this regard are Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 104 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance), title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations in 28 CFR part 35 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, regardless of receipt of Federal funds), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 100 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of Federal financial assistance).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section to subpart D, we have retained the requirements in current Sec. 300.345(e), which require the public agency to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the parent understands the proceedings at an IEP Team meeting, including arranging for an interpreter for parents with deafness or whose native language is other than English.  This requirement is in new Sec. 300.322(e).  We have also included a cross reference to new Sec. 300.322(e) in Sec. 300.501(c)(2) to clarify that. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.  Section 300.503 already requires prior written notice to be given to the parents of a child with a disability a reasonable time before the public agency proposes (or refuses) to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.503(c) and 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and provided in the native language or other mode of communication of the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the public agency must take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.501(b)(3) implies that teaching methodologies and lesson plans must be included in the IEP, which exceeds the requirements of the Act.  The commenters recommended removing "if those issues are not addressed in the child's IEP" from Sec. 300.501(b)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the phrase referred to by the commenters is confusing and open to misinterpretation and are removing it from Sec. 300.501(b)(3). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "if those issues are not addressed in the child's IEP" from Sec. 300.501(b)(3) for clarity.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended requiring a public agency to make several attempts to involve parents in placement decisions and requested that Sec. 300.501 be changed to require a public agency to maintain:  (1) detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; (2) copies of correspondence sent to parents and any responses received; and (3) detailed records of visits made to a parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe the additional language requested by the commenters is necessary.  Section 300.501(c)(4) requires a public agency to maintain a record of its attempts to contact parents prior to making a placement decision without parent participation.  We believe this requirement is sufficient to ensure that a public agency holding a placement meeting with neither parent in attendance takes the necessary steps to contact parents and maintain appropriate documentation of its attempts to ensure parent participation.  As a matter of practice, public agencies use a variety of methods to contact parents depending on the ways they find to be most efficient and effective for a particular situation.  Public agencies take seriously their obligation to include parents in placement decisions and are in the best position to determine the records they need to demonstrate that they have taken appropriate steps to include parents in placement decisions before holding a placement meeting without a parent in attendance.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that placement meetings not be held, or decisions made, without a representative of the child.  The commenters recommended appointing a surrogate parent when the biological or adoptive parent refuses to attend, or is unable to participate, in the placement meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is no statutory authority to permit the appointment of a surrogate parent when a parent is either unable or unwilling to attend a meeting in which a decision is made relating to a child's educational placement.  In section 615(b)(2) of the Act, a public agency does not have the authority to appoint a surrogate parent where a child's parent is available or can be identified and located after reasonable efforts, but refuses, or is unable, to attend a meeting or otherwise represent the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Independent educational evaluation (Sec. 300.502)<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble2%2Cprepart2%2CE%2C2910%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language to Sec. 300.502 requiring evaluators who conduct independent educational evaluations (IEEs) to be licensed by the State.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations in the manner requested by the commenter because the regulations already require that the standards be the same for all evaluators, as long as the agency's criteria for evaluators do not prohibit a parent from obtaining an IEE.  An IEE is defined in Sec. 300.502(a)(3)(i) as an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency responsible for the education of the child in question.  Section 300.502(e) provides that in order for an IEE to be at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with the parent's right to an IEE.  Except for these criteria, Sec. 300.502(e)(2) provides that a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense.  Consistent with applicable agency criteria, it would be appropriate for a public agency to require an IEE examiner to hold, or be eligible to hold, a particular license when a public agency requires the same licensure for personnel who conduct the same types of evaluations for the agency.  In contrast, it would be inconsistent with a parent's right to an IEE for a public agency to require all evaluators to be licensed, if only individuals employed by a public agency may obtain a license.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding parental rights to an IEE when a public agency is using a response to intervention process to determine whether a child has SLD.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a parent disagrees with the results of a completed evaluation that includes a review of the results of a child's response to intervention process, the parent has a right to an IEE at public expense, subject to the conditions in Sec. 300.502(b)(2) through (b)(4).  The parent, however, would not have the right to obtain an IEE at public expense before the public agency completes its evaluation simply because the parent disagrees with the public agency's decision to use data from a child's response to intervention as part of its evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification regarding a public agency's right to limit the amount it pays for an IEE and asked whether a public agency can place limits on the frequency of an IEE (e.g., a single IEE in an evaluation cycle or in a child's school career).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is the Department's longstanding position that public agencies should not be required to bear the cost of unreasonably expensive IEEs.  This position is reflected in the regulatory provisions.  Section 300.502(a)(2) provides that if a parent requests an IEE at public expense, the public agency must provide the parent with information about where an IEE may be obtained and the agency criteria applicable for IEEs.  In order for an evaluation to be at public expense, Sec. 300.502(e)(1) requires that the criteria under which an IEE is obtained, including the location of the IEE and the qualifications of the examiner, be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent that those criteria are consistent with a parent's right to an IEE.  In addition, Sec. 300.502(e)(2) states that, except for the criteria described above, a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Although it is appropriate for a public agency to establish reasonable cost containment criteria applicable to personnel used by the agency, as well as to personnel used by parents, a public agency would need to provide a parent the opportunity to demonstrate that unique circumstances justify selection of an evaluator whose fees fall outside the agency's cost containment criteria.  Section 300.502(b)(2) provides that if the parent requests an IEE at public expense, the public agency either must ensure that the IEE is provided at public expense or file a due process complaint notice to request a hearing to demonstrate that the agency's evaluation is appropriate.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not, however, believe that the parent should be limited to one IEE at public expense in a child's school career.  In the school career of a child, there could be more than one point when there is a legitimate disagreement between a parent and the public agency over evaluations of the child.  Nevertheless, we do believe that it is important to clarify that a parent is not entitled to more than one IEE at public expense when the parent disagrees with a specific evaluation or reevaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(5) in Sec. 300.502 to clarify that a parent is entitled to only one IEE each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.  This regulatory provision is consistent with a parent's statutory right to an IEE at public expense, while recognizing that public agencies should not be required to bear the cost of more than one IEE when a parent disagrees with an evaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(5) in Sec. 300.502 to clarify that a parent is entitled to only one IEE at public expense each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters suggested adding language allowing an evaluator conducting an IEE the opportunity to review existing data, receive input from the child's parents, determine what additional data are needed to determine the scope of the evaluation, and select the instruments appropriate to evaluate the child.  The commenters also stated that the public agency should not restrict the scope of the evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to add language to the regulations regarding the review of existing data, input from the child's parents, the scope of the evaluation, or the instruments used to evaluate the child, because an IEE must meet the agency criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, consistent with Sec. 300.502(e).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.305(a) provides that, as part of an initial evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this part, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, must review existing evaluation data on the child, including input from the child's parents.  Since the review of existing evaluation data and input from the child's parents are part of the public agency's evaluation, they would also be appropriate elements in an IEE.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Similarly, Sec. 300.304(b)(1) provides that an evaluation conducted by a public agency must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about the child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8, and the content of the child's IEP, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child to participate in appropriate activities).  These requirements also apply to an IEE conducted by an independent evaluator, since these requirements will be a part of the agency's criteria.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Generally, the purpose of an evaluation under the Act is to determine whether the child is a child with a disability, and in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to have a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  It would be inconsistent with the Act for a public agency to limit the scope of an IEE in a way that would prevent an independent evaluator from fulfilling these purposes.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended adding language to the regulations requiring a parent to provide consent for release of education records when a hearing officer orders an LEA to provide an IEE at public expense.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consistent with Sec. 300.622(b), parental consent is not required for a public agency to release education records to a hearing officer because a hearing officer is an official of a participating agency, as defined in Sec. 300.611(c).  However, when a hearing officer orders an IEE, parental consent would be required under Sec. 300.622(a) for a public agency to release education records to the independent evaluator who will conduct the IEE, since in these situations, the independent evaluator is not an official of a participating agency.  If a parent refuses to consent to the release of education records to an independent evaluator, a hearing officer could decide to dismiss the complaint.  Therefore, we are not changing the regulations in the manner suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested clarification regarding what an LEA must do to satisfy the requirement in Sec. 300.502(c)(1) that a public agency consider the results of an evaluation obtained by a parent at private expense.  The commenters stated that public agencies often ignore the results of an IEE and recommended requiring public agencies to explain why an IEE was rejected.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.502(c)(1) imposes an affirmative obligation on a public agency to consider the results of a parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in any decision regarding the provision of FAPE to the child, if that evaluation meets agency criteria.  The requirement, however, does not mean that the public agency is compelled to consider the parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in its decision regarding the provision of FAPE, if it does not meet agency criteria.  If the agency believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria, it would be appropriate for the agency to explain to the parent why it believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters indicated that permitting any party to use the results from a privately-funded IEE as evidence at a due process hearing may discourage parents from initiating and paying for evaluations of their child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a parent obtains an evaluation at private expense, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires a parent to share that evaluation with the public agency.  A privately-funded evaluation that is not shared with a public agency would not be considered an IEE under this regulation.  If, however, the parent chooses to share the evaluation with the public agency, that evaluation may be presented by any party as evidence in a due process hearing, in accordance with Sec. 300.502(c)(2).  Similarly, if a public agency reimburses a parent for an IEE, and the parent disagrees with the results of the IEE, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from introducing that evaluation in a due process hearing over the parent's objection.  We disagree with the commenters to the extent that they believe that parents should have an expectation of privacy regarding an evaluation that is publicly-funded or for which they seek public funding.  We believe it is necessary to change Sec. 300.502(c)(2) to ensure that public agencies have the opportunity to introduce the results of publicly-funded IEEs at due process hearings. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.502(c) to permit any party to present the results of a publicly-funded IEE.

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations prohibit the testimony of experts who did not evaluate the child before the due process hearing, unless the other party has an equal opportunity to evaluate the child at public expense, both parties consent to such testimony, or the hearing officer or judge orders the evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to regulate in the manner recommended by the commenter.  Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis in light of the specific facts of each case at the discretion of the hearing officer.  We believe that the hearing officer, as the designated trier of fact under the Act, is in the best position to determine whether expert testimony should be admitted and what weight, if any, should be accorded that expert testimony.  We would expect that these decisions will be governed by commonly applied State evidentiary standards, such as whether the testimony is relevant, reliable, and based on sufficient facts and data.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.503(a) incorporates section 615(b)(3) of the Act and requires a public agency to provide parents with written notice that meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503(b) a reasonable time before the public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  We do not believe that it is necessary to substitute a specific timeline to clarify what is meant by the requirement that the notice be provided within a reasonable period of time, because we are not aware of significant problems in the timing of prior written notices.  In addition, prior written notice is provided in a wide variety of circumstances for which any one timeline would be too rigid and, in many cases, might prove unworkable.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe that it is necessary to add a requirement that IEP Teams carefully consider all the data and options before making a decision to change a child's placement or refuse the parent's request for services.  Section 300.306(c) already requires the group of professionals and the parent of the child to carefully consider information from a variety of sources before determining a child's eligibility and placement.  Furthermore, the requirements for developing, reviewing, and revising a child's IEP in Sec. 300.324, ensure that IEP Teams carefully consider all available information in developing an IEP, including information from the child's parents. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter asked how a parent would know that the public agency is refusing to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or placement of a child without an IEP Team meeting.  Another commenter stated that prior written notice should be provided in advance of an IEP Team meeting, not at the IEP Team meeting, so that parents could prepare for the meeting.  The commenter suggested adding language to the regulations requiring that the notice be given a reasonable time before an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter confuses the Act's prior written notice requirements with the requirements governing IEP Team meetings.  Section 300.503(a), consistent with section 615(b)(3) of the Act, requires prior written notice whenever a public agency proposes to initiate or change (or refuses to initiate or change) the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision of FAPE to a child.  A public agency meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503 so long as the prior written notice is provided a reasonable time before the public agency implements the proposal (or refusal) described in the notice.  A public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting before it proposes a change in the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  The proposal, however, triggers the obligation to convene an IEP Team meeting.  Providing prior written notice in advance of meetings could suggest, in some circumstances, that the public agency's proposal was improperly arrived at before the meeting and without parent input.  Therefore, we are not changing Sec. 300.503 to require the prior written notice to be provided prior to an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  It is not necessary to explain in the regulations that prior written notice can be provided at the same time as parental consent is requested, because parental consent cannot be obtained without the requisite prior written notice.

Comment:  Many comments were received regarding when the procedural safeguards notice must be provided to parents.  One commenter stated that these requirements add paperwork and procedural burdens.  Several commenters expressed concern that parents will have knowledge of their procedural safeguards only when they file a State complaint or request a due process hearing.  Some commenters recommended deleting the requirement in Sec. 300.504(a)(2) for the public agency to give parents the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint or due process hearing in the school year.  Other commenters suggested amending Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to require that the procedural safeguards notice be provided to parents upon receipt of the first due process complaint in that school year.  Some commenters asked whether parents would receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice only upon the first filing of a State complaint or a due process complaint, but not twice, if a parent submits a complaint and also a request for a due process hearing in the same school year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter was concerned that the parents of a child with a disability who transfers into a new school will not be notified of their procedural rights in a timely manner.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(a) reflects the new statutory language in section 615(d)(1) of the Act, regarding the timing of the procedural safeguards notice.  Section 300.504(a)(1) and (4), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, states that a copy of the procedural safeguards must be given to parents one time a year, except that a copy must also be given to parents upon initial referral or parent request for evaluation; upon receipt of the first State complaint and due process complaint in that school year; and upon request by a parent.  There is no longer a requirement that the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents upon notification of each IEP Team meeting, as in current Sec. 300.504(a).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We disagree that Sec. 300.504(a)(2) should be removed.  The Department intends for parents to receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and upon receipt of the first due process complaint under Sec. 300.507 in a school year because we believe that parents particularly need a clear understanding of their rights when they embark on these processes and might not have available copies of the procedural safeguards notice provided earlier in the year, or the notice they previously received may be outdated.  We are changing Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to make this clear.  We also are changing Sec. 300.504(a) to specify that the statutory phrase "one time a year" refers to "one time a school year."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Regarding the concern that a parent whose child transfers to a new school district might not receive appropriate notice of the Act's procedural safeguards, we do not believe that additional clarification is necessary.  We believe that these regulatory provisions are sufficient to ensure that the parent of a child who changes school districts receives the requisite notice in a timely manner.  When the child with a disability transfers to a new school district, that school district would have an obligation to ensure that the child's parents are provided notice at least once in that school year and at the other times specified in Sec. 300.504(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.504(a) are necessary to ensure that parents have information about the due process procedures when they are most likely to need them and do not view these requirements as unduly burdensome.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.504(a)(2) has been changed to require public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint under Sec.

Another commenter recommended that the procedural safeguards notice be given at the time a manifestation determination is reviewed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act requires public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice not later than the date on which the decision to take disciplinary action is made.  Therefore, we are adding this requirement in Sec. 300.504(a).  We will not add a requirement for public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice following the manifestation determination conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), because it would be unnecessarily duplicative to require a procedural safeguards notice to be provided both prior to and after a decision to take disciplinary action has been made.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (3) has been added in Sec. 300.504(a) to require the procedural safeguards notice to be provided to parents in accordance with the discipline procedures in Sec. 300.530(h).

In addition, each title I school must provide each parent timely notice that the parent's child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks, by a teacher who is not highly qualified.

Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern with allowing LEAs to post the procedural safeguards notice on the school's Web site.  Several commenters asked whether directing a parent to the Web site constitutes distribution of the notice under the Act.  One commenter suggested adding specific language to the regulations stating that posting the notice on the school Web site does not replace other Part B requirements regarding distribution of the notice.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(b), incorporates section 615(d)(1)(B) of the Act, and permits, but does not require, a public agency to post a current copy of the procedural safeguards notice on its Web site, if one exists.  The public agency would not meet its obligation in Sec. 300.504(a) by simply directing a parent to the Web site.  Rather, a public agency must still offer parents a printed copy of the procedural safeguards notice.  If, however, a parent declines the offered printed copy of the notice and indicates a clear preference to obtain the notice electronically on their own from the agency's Web site, it would be reasonable for the public agency to document that it offered a printed copy of the notice that the parent declined.  Posting the procedural safeguards notice on a public agency's Web site is clearly optional and for the convenience of the public and does not replace the distribution requirements in the Act.  We do not believe it is necessary to add a regulation to clarify this.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

In addition to making this model procedural safeguards notice available on the Department's Web site, we also are amending the cross-references in Sec. 300.504(c) to identify the specific regulatory provisions that include procedural safeguards for which an explanation must be provided in the procedural safeguards notice.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Because resolution meetings are part of the due process procedures, consistent with Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, the explanation of due process procedures would necessarily include information about how the resolution meeting works and the responsibilities of the parties in the resolution meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is necessary to require the procedural safeguards notice to explain the differences between mediation and resolution meetings because the differences will be apparent from the clear explanations of the respective procedures that are already required in the notice.

Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and the due process complaint procedures in Sec. 300.507 in the procedural safeguards notice to assist parents in understanding the differences between these procedures.  The reference to "jurisdictional issues" addresses the scope of the State complaint and due process complaint procedures.  An organization or individual may file a State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 alleging that a public agency has violated a requirement of the Act for a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date on which the complaint is received, unless one of the exceptions in Sec. 300.153(c) is applicable.  The Department's longstanding position is that a State must resolve any complaint, and may not remove from the jurisdiction of its State complaint procedures complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child simply because those issues also could be the subject of a due process complaint.  We view the State complaint procedures as a very important tool in a State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities, consistent with sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a) of the Act, to monitor LEA implementation of the requirements in Part B of the Act.  These responsibilities extend to both systemic and child-specific issues.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A parent or a public agency may file a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507 on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to such child for an alleged violation that occurred not more than two years (or, within the timeframe established by the State) before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.505, which incorporates section 615(n) of the Act, permits public agencies to make the electronic mail option available for notices required in section 615 of the Act, including the prior written notice, procedural safeguards notice, and due process complaint notice.  It would be an unnecessary paperwork burden to require a parent who elects to receive notices by electronic mail to do so in writing, particularly when there are other methods available to document such a request, for example, by the LEA making a notation of the parent's verbal request.  We believe public agencies should have the flexibility to determine whether and how to document that a parent elects to receive these notices by electronic mail.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that the S. Rpt.

The commenters, therefore, recommended permitting a hearing officer to require mediation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.506(a) incorporates section 615(e)(1) of the Act and requires public agencies to establish and implement procedures to allow parties to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint, to resolve disputes through a mediation process.  Section 615(e)(2)(A)(i) of the Act requires the public agency to ensure, among other things, that the mediation process is voluntary on the part of the parties.  In light of these explicit statutory requirements, we do not believe that a hearing officer can order that the parties to a due process complaint engage in mediation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We do not believe that additional language is necessary to address the commenter's concern.  Section 300.506(a) requires each public agency to ensure that procedures are established and implemented to allow parties to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint, to resolve disputes through mediation.  We believe that parties could use mediation prior to, or after, filing a State complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.506(b)(1)(ii), consistent with section 615(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, is clear that mediation cannot be used to deny or delay a parent's right to a hearing on the parent's due process complaint, or to deny other rights afforded under Part B of the Act.  "Other rights under Part B of the Act" include a parent's right to file a State complaint and to have that complaint resolved within applicable timelines.  If the parties involved voluntarily wish to engage in mediation once the complaint is filed, and the mediation is not successful in resolving the dispute, the entity responsible for resolving the complaint at the State level must ensure that the complaint is resolved within the applicable timelines in Sec. 300.152.  Mediation is not an exceptional circumstance that would justify extension of the 60-day timeline for issuing the final decision in a State complaint, unless the parties agree otherwise.  However, as provided in Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii), the parent and the public agency involved can agree to extend the time limit to engage in mediation to resolve the complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We decline to define "effective mediation techniques" in the manner suggested by the commenters.  States have used a number of successful techniques over the years to resolve disputes between parents and public agencies, and we do not want to restrict a State's discretion by providing a particular definition.  Whether formal training and certification for mediators is required is a decision best left to each State, depending on State policy.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring mediators to be unbiased and knowledgeable in laws, regulations, and best practices related to children with disabilities.

Other commenters recommended that the list of mediators and their qualifications be provided to parents and the public.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe additional regulations regarding the qualifications of mediators are necessary.  Section 300.506(b)(3), consistent with section 615(e)(2)(C) of the Act, requires States to maintain a list of individuals who are qualified mediators and knowledgeable in the laws and regulations relating to the provision of special education and related services.  In addition, Sec. 300.506(c)(1)(ii) requires impartial mediators who do not have a personal or professional interest that would conflict with the person's objectivity.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Parents do not select the mediator to mediate a particular case.  Rather, Sec. 300.506(b)(3)(ii) requires that the process for selecting mediators be impartial.  Therefore, we do not believe that public agencies should be required to provide the list of mediators and their qualifications to parents and the public.

Comment:  Many commenters stated that mediation discussions should remain confidential and not be used in any subsequent due process hearings or proceedings.  The commenters recommended that the phrase "arising from that dispute" in Sec. 300.506(b)(6)(i) and Sec. 300.506(b)(8) be removed.  The commenters viewed these provisions as permitting confidentiality to apply only to the current issue in dispute, and not in other subsequent actions.  Some commenters expressed concern that mediation could be used as "discovery" for some future dispute between parties, or for a simultaneous dispute between the same public agency and some other children, or disputes involving the same lawyers but different parties.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the phrase "arising from that dispute" should be removed in Sec. 300.506(b)(6)(i) or Sec. 300.506(b)(8).  We believe that it is important to preserve the integrity of the mediation process to ensure that mediation discussions remain confidential and not be used in subsequent due process hearings or civil proceedings.  To ensure that we do not interfere with the evidentiary privilege laws of States that might not participate in the Part B program (a possibility, but not a current actuality), we are adding new language that limits the confidentiality provision to apply to due process hearings and proceedings in any Federal court and any State court of a State participating in Part B of the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase "arising from that dispute" from Sec. 300.506(b)(6)(i).

Discussion:  Following the publication of the NPRM, the Department reconsidered the subject of confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation.  Section 300.506(b)(9) was included in the NPRM in light of note 208 of Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 216, which indicates the Conference committee's intention that parties could be required to sign confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation, without regard to whether the mediation ultimately resolves the dispute.  However, Sec. 300.506(b)(8), already requires that discussions that occur during the mediation process be confidential and not be used as evidence in any subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding.  Therefore, we are removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9).  Removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9), however, is not intended to prevent States from allowing parties to sign a confidentiality pledge to ensure that discussions during the mediation process remain confidential, irrespective of whether the mediation results in a resolution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.506(c)(1)(ii) incorporates section 615(e) of the Act, and provides that mediators must not have a personal or professional interest that would conflict with the person's objectivity.  SEAs have an interest in ensuring that their mediators are seen as impartial persons so that the parties to disputes will be willing to use mediation to resolve those disputes.  We do not believe that further regulation is needed, as the SEAs' interest in ensuring that mediators are seen as impartial should be sufficient to provide for mechanisms to resolve conflicts to the extent needed in that State. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters supported the time limit for submitting a due process complaint.  Some commenters stated that the regulations should clarify that, while States may adopt an explicit statute of limitations that is shorter than two years, they may not adopt a time period that is longer than two years.  Other commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that if a State has an explicit time limit for requesting a due process hearing the State time limit must be reasonable.  A few commenters recommended requiring States to conduct public hearings and provide an opportunity for public comment before the State establishes a reasonable time limit for filing a due process complaint.  Still other commenters stated that the regulations should include a statement that common-law directives regarding statutes of limitations should not override the Act or State regulatory time limits.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Some commenters expressed concern that reducing the statute of limitations from three years to two years makes it impossible to protect the rights of children.

Discussion:  Section 300.507(a)(2) and section 615(b)(6)(B) of the Act are clear that a due process complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than two years before the date the parent or public agency knew, or should have known, about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint, or if the State has an explicit time limit for filing a due process complaint, in the time allowed by that State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	There is nothing in the Act that would preclude a State from having a time limit for filing a complaint that is shorter or longer than two years.  We believe that the Act leaves this decision to the States.  A State choosing to adopt a time limit for requesting a hearing, other than the two year time limit in the Act, must comply with the public participation requirements in Sec. 300.165 and section 612(a)(19) of the Act, which require that prior to the adoption of any policies and procedures needed to comply with Part B of the Act (including any amendments to such policies and procedures), the State must ensure that there are public hearings, adequate notice of the hearings, and an opportunity for public comment.  However, if a State already has an explicit time limit in statute or regulation, and has met the requirements in Sec. 300.165 and section 612(a)(19) of the Act in establishing that requirement, new public hearings and public comment periods are not required.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 615(f)(3)(D) of the Act provides explicit exceptions to the timeline for requesting a due process hearing.  Section 300.511(f) incorporates these provisions.

	The Department believes that parents should have easy access to information about any free or low-cost legal and other relevant services in the area.

There is no requirement that a party file a State complaint prior to filing a due process hearing, and we believe that the regulation is sufficiently clear about this point.

	Many commenters recommended removing the phrase "or engage in a resolution meeting" in Sec. 300.508(c).  The commenters expressed concern that requiring parties to engage in a resolution meeting before a due process hearing will delay the due process hearing, particularly when the parties must wait for a hearing officer to determine the sufficiency of a due process complaint before holding a resolution meeting.

Discussion:  Section 300.510(a), consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the LEA, within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, and prior to the initiation of a hearing, to convene a meeting with the parent and the relevant members of the IEP Team to discuss the parent's due process complaint so that the LEA has an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  Section 300.508(d)(1), consistent with section 615(c)(2)(A) and (D) of the Act, provides that the due process complaint must be deemed sufficient unless the party receiving the due process complaint notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the due process complaint, that the due process complaint does not meet the requirements in Sec. 300.508(b).  If the party receiving the due process complaint notice believes the complaint is insufficient, the hearing officer determines the sufficiency of the complaint.  There is no requirement that the party who alleges that a notice is insufficient state in writing the basis for the belief.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.508(d)(2), consistent with section 615(c)(2)(D) of the Act, states that the hearing officer must make a determination within five days of receiving notice that the party believes the complaint is insufficient and immediately notify the parties in writing of that determination.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	If the hearing officer determines that the notice is not sufficient, the hearing officer's decision will identify how the notice is insufficient, so that the filing party can amend the notice, if appropriate.  We are not further regulating on how the sufficiency claim is raised, however, as we believe that this matter is more appropriately addressed by each State, in light of their other hearing procedures. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 615(b)(7)(B) of the Act, provides that a party may not have a hearing on a due process complaint until the party or the party's attorney files a due process complaint that meets the content standards in section 615(b)(7)(A) of the Act, which are reflected in Sec. 300.508(b).  If the complaint is determined to be insufficient and is not amended, the complaint could be dismissed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 38, which states that the resolution meeting should not be postponed when the LEA believes that a parent's complaint is insufficient.  While the period to file a sufficiency claim is the same as the period for holding the resolution meeting, parties receiving due process complaint notices should raise their sufficiency claims as early as possible, so that the resolution period will provide a meaningful opportunity for the parties to resolve the dispute.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In order to resolve ambiguity on the relationship of a sufficiency claim to the resolution meeting, we are revising Sec. 300.508(c) to remove the reference, which is not statutory, to the resolution meeting.  There is no need to hold more than one resolution meeting, impose additional procedural rules, or otherwise adjust the resolution timeline. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to add language to the regulations stating that a public agency may not deny or delay a parent's right to a due process hearing.  We believe that the timelines and requirements for filing a due process complaint, and the timelines for hearing officer decisions regarding the sufficiency of a complaint will safeguard against due process hearings being unfairly or unnecessarily delayed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the words "or engage in a resolution meeting" in Sec. 300.508(c) for clarity.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the timeline for filing a due process hearing should begin when the due process complaint is deemed sufficient.  However, some commenters stated that the timeline should begin when a party files a due process complaint notice.  Several commenters stated that a hearing officer should be allowed to determine whether an amended complaint relates to the original complaint for purposes of determining the time limit for filing a due process complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that a separate filing of a due process complaint notice and due process complaint, with separate timelines, is required by the Act, as those distinctions would be unnecessarily burdensome and cumbersome.  Section 615(b)(7)(A)(i) of the Act describes the due process complaint notice as being filed "in the complaint," and we have organized our regulation consistent with this provision.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.507(a)(2), consistent with section 615(b)(6)(B) of the Act, states that a due process complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than two years (or the time allowed by State law), before the date the parent or public agency knew, or should have known, about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint.  Section 615(f)(3)(D) of the Act provides exceptions to the timeline if a parent was prevented from filing a due process complaint, which are reflected in Sec. 300.511(f).  It is up to hearing officers to determine whether a specific complaint is within the allowable timeline, including whether an amended complaint relates to a previous complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters stated that the process for amending a due process complaint is complex and unnecessarily complicated, and will force parents to seek the services of an attorney and make the relationship between parties more adversarial.  One commenter recommended allowing a hearing request to be amended up to five days before the parties meet to set a hearing schedule, rather than five days before the hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that the process for amending a due process complaint is complex and unnecessarily complicated.  Section 300.508(d)(3) and section 615(c)(2)(E) of the Act allow the party filing the due process complaint an opportunity to amend the complaint to ensure that the complaint accurately sets out their differences with the other party.  The complaint can be amended only if the parties mutually agree in writing to the amendment and are given the opportunity for a resolution meeting, or the hearing officer grants permission to amend the complaint at any time not later than five days before the due process hearing begins.  This process ensures that the parties involved understand and agree on the nature of the complaint before the hearing begins.  We, therefore, decline to change these regulations, and see no reason to change the timeline for amending a complaint in the manner suggested by the commenter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.508(d)(4) and section 615(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act provide that when a due process complaint is amended, the timelines for the resolution meeting and the time period for resolving the complaint begin again with the filing of the amended due process complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters stated that parents who are filing a due process complaint without the assistance of an attorney should have more flexibility when the sufficiency of the complaint is determined.  The commenters stated that parents should be able to receive assistance from their State's due process office to complete the due process complaint so that it meets the standard for sufficiency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  To assist parents in filing a due process complaint, Sec. 300.509 and section 615(b)(8) of the Act require each State to develop a model due process complaint form.  While there is no requirement that States assist parents in completing the due process complaint form, resolution of a complaint is more likely when both parties to the complaint have a clear understanding of the nature of the complaint.  Therefore, the Department encourages States, to the extent possible, to assist a parent in completing the due process complaint so that it meets the standards for sufficiency.  However, consistent with section 615(c)(2)(D) of the Act, the final decision regarding the sufficiency of a due process complaint is left to the discretion of the hearing officer.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that parents who file a due process complaint without the assistance of an attorney should be allowed to amend their complaint without having to start the process all over again, as long as their statement provides the information LEAs need to proceed toward resolution.  A few commenters stated that a formal amendment should not be required for minor insufficiencies, such as leaving out the child's address or name of the child's school, especially if the LEA already has this information.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Many commenters recommended that a hearing officer be allowed to permit a party to amend the due process complaint, unless doing so would prejudice the opposing party.  The commenters stated that, at a minimum, the regulations should state that hearing officers must follow the standard that permits them to freely grant amendments, regardless of timelines, when justice so requires.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.508(d)(3), consistent with section 615(c)(2)(E) of the Act, provides that a party may only amend its complaint in two circumstances:  (1) if the other party consents in writing to the amendment and is given the opportunity to resolve the complaint in a resolution meeting convened under Sec. 300.510, or (2) if the hearing officer grants permission for the amendment, but only at a time not later than five days before the hearing begins.  Therefore, we do not believe further clarification is necessary.  With regard to parents who file a due process complaint without the assistance of an attorney or for minor deficiencies or omissions in complaints, we would expect that hearing officers would exercise appropriate discretion in considering requests for amendments.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter suggested adding language to the regulations stating that an LEA may request and, as a matter of right, be granted one 10-day extension to respond to a parent's due process complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that the receiving party must provide the party that filed the complaint a response to the complaint within 10 days of receiving the complaint.  The Act makes no provision for extending this time period, and we do not believe it would be appropriate to amend the regulations in this manner.  Allowing an LEA additional time to respond to a parent's due process complaint could be used to unduly delay the due process hearing, to the detriment of the interests of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations appear to require parents to be represented by an attorney in due process proceedings and requested that the regulations permit a party in a due process hearing to be represented by a non-attorney advocate.  The commenters stated that this would allow more uniform access to assistance across all socio-economic groups and decrease the formality of hearings.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are considering the issue of non-attorney representation of parties in a due process hearing under the Act, in light of State rules concerning the unauthorized practice of law.

Discussion:  The Act does not establish consequences for parents who are the receiving parties to complaints if they fail to respond to a due process complaint notice.  However, either party's failure to respond to, or to file, the requisite notices could increase the likelihood that the resolution meeting will not be successful in resolving the dispute and that a more costly and time-consuming due process hearing will occur.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.508, consistent with section 615(b) and (c) of the Act, sets out the requirements and timelines for filing a due process complaint.  We do not believe the further clarification requested by the commenter is necessary because the due process complaint procedures are intended to resolve pre-hearing issues and disputes and allow parties to seek immediate resolution by a hearing officer, when necessary, regarding the sufficiency of a due process complaint and amendments to a complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We agree that the use of the model forms should not be required by an SEA or LEA, and that parents (or other parties filing a State complaint) may use some other form of notice, so long as their notice meets the content requirements of the Act.

Changes:  We have restructured Sec. 300.509 and clarified that SEAs or LEAs cannot require the use of the model forms.

Discussion:  It would be over-regulating to require a State to work with a particular group or groups to develop their model forms.  We believe that such decisions are best made by each State and, therefore, decline to require a State to work with the State PTI and CPRC to develop the model forms.  However, States must comply with the public participation requirements in Sec. 300.165 and section 612(a)(19) of the Act prior to adopting a model form.  To meet the public participation requirements, the State must ensure that there are public hearings and an opportunity for comment available to the general public, including individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to prohibit a hearing officer from finding that a complaint is insufficient if the receiving party properly challenges the sufficiency of the complaint in accordance with Sec. 300.508(d)(1) because the State has failed to develop the model forms in accordance with Sec. 300.509 and section 615(b)(8) of the Act.  Development of the model forms is a State responsibility and parties to a due process hearing should not be penalized because a State fails to meet the requirements in section 615(b)(8) of the Act.

We do not believe it is necessary to require an LEA to notify the parent within five days of receiving a due process complaint about the LEA's intention to convene or waive the resolution process.  An LEA that wishes to engage in a resolution meeting will need to contact the parent to arrange the meeting soon after the due process complaint is received in order to ensure that the resolution meeting is held within 15 days.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act states that an LEA must convene a resolution meeting with the parents and the relevant members of the IEP Team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint that includes a representative of the public agency who has decision-making authority on behalf of that agency, and may not include the LEA's attorney unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.510(a)(4) states that the parent and the LEA determine the relevant members of the IEP Team to attend the resolution meeting.  We do not believe it is necessary to clarify that a parent may bring other participants, such as an advocate or family friend, to the resolution meeting because section 614(d)(1)(B)(vi) of the Act and Sec. 300.321(a)(6) are clear that the IEP Team may include, at the discretion of the parent or the agency, other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child.  Therefore, such individuals could attend the resolution meeting if the LEA or parent determined that such individuals are relevant members of the IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe it is necessary to regulate on whether a parent must provide advance notice to the LEA that the parent intends to bring an attorney to the resolution meeting because we expect that it would not be in the interest of the parent to withhold such information prior to a resolution meeting so as to appear at the resolution meeting with an attorney without advance notice to the public agency.  In such cases, the public agency could refuse to hold the resolution meeting until it could arrange the attendance of its attorney (within the 15-day period).  The parent would incur additional expenses from having to bring their attorney to two resolution meetings. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

We urge LEAs and parents to act cooperatively in determining who will attend the resolution meeting, as a resolution meeting is unlikely to result in any resolution of the dispute if the parties cannot even agree on who should attend.  The parties should keep in mind that the resolution process offers a valuable chance to resolve disputes before expending what can be considerable time and money in due process hearings.

Discussion:  We understand that circumstances beyond a parent's control (e.g., military service, hospitalization) may prevent a parent from attending a resolution meeting in person.  If the LEA notifies the parent of its intent to schedule a resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, and the parent informs the LEA in advance of the meeting that circumstances prevent the parent from attending the meeting in person, it would be appropriate for an LEA to offer to use alternative means to ensure parent participation, such as those described in Sec. 300.328, including videoconferences or conference telephone calls, subject to the parent's agreement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
There is no authority in the Act for an LEA to permit a court-appointed advocate to attend the resolution meeting in place of a parent, unless the public agency has appointed that individual as a surrogate parent in accordance with Sec. 300.519, or the agency determines that the person is a person acting in the place of the biological or adoptive parent of the child in accordance with Sec. 300.30(a)(4).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter noted that Sec. 300.510(b)(1) states that if an LEA has not resolved a due process complaint within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint, the due process hearing "must" occur, which is inconsistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, which states that the due process hearing "may" occur.  However, another commenter recommended retaining the language in Sec. 300.510(b), in lieu of the permissive statutory language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.510(b)(1) should be changed to be consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.  A requirement that a due process hearing must occur when the resolution period is not successful in resolving the underlying dispute could prove unduly restrictive for the parties, particularly in situations where the parties agree to an extension of the resolution period or reach a settlement after the resolution period has expired.  Therefore, we are changing Sec. 300.510(b)(1) to state that a due process hearing "may" occur if the parties have not resolved the dispute that formed the basis for the due process complaint by the end of the resolution period.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.510(b)(1) has been changed by removing the word "must" and replacing it with "may" prior to the word "occur" to reflect the language in section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring LEAs to waive the resolution period when a parent can show that, prior to the filing of the complaint, the LEA had specific knowledge of the facts later identified in the complaint and had a reasonable time to resolve the issue, or did not notify the parent within five days of the resolution meeting or inform the parent of their options.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides two occasions when a resolution meeting need not occur:  (1) when the parent and LEA agree in writing to waive the meeting; and (2) when the parent and LEA agree to use the mediation process in Sec. 300.506.  There are no provisions that allow a parent or an LEA to unilaterally waive the resolution meeting.  In the circumstances mentioned by the commenter, the resolution meeting still is a required vehicle for the parent and the LEA to attempt to resolve their differences prior to initiating a due process hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  We received numerous comments expressing concern about the resolution process and requesting changes to the regulations to ensure that the resolution process is used effectively to resolve disputes and not to delay or deny the right to a due process hearing.  Some commenters requested that Sec. 300.510(b)(3) be removed because it allows a public agency to delay the due process hearing by scheduling resolution meetings at times or places that are inconvenient for the parent.  Many commenters recommended that if an LEA fails to convene a resolution meeting within the required 15 days, bring the required personnel to a resolution meeting, or participate in a resolution meeting in good faith, the 45-day timeline for a hearing decision should begin on the date that the due process complaint notice was filed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters requested clarification on what is considered "participation" or "good faith" participation in a resolution meeting and who decides if participation has occurred.  A number of commenters recommended that the regulations permit a hearing officer to determine whether a parent or LEA has participated in the resolution meeting and whether the due process hearing can proceed.  Another commenter requested clarification on when the 45-day timeline for a due process hearing begins when a hearing officer determines that a parent has participated.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters asked how long a due process complaint remains open if the parent does not participate during the 30-day resolution period.  A number of commenters requested clarification as to whether and how an LEA can dismiss a due process complaint when a parent refuses to participate in a resolution meeting.  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify the consequences of indefinitely delaying a due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that Sec. 300.510(b)(3) should be removed.  This provision is based on H. Rpt. No. 108-77, p. 114, that provides:</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
[If] the parent and the LEA mutually agree that the meeting does not need to occur, the resolution meeting does not need to take place.  However, unless such an agreement is reached, the failure of the party bringing the complaints to participate in the meeting will delay the timeline for convening a due process hearing until the meeting is held.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We fully expect that only in very rare situations will an LEA fail to meet its obligation to convene a resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, delay the due process hearing by scheduling meetings at times or places that are inconvenient for the parent, or otherwise not participate in good faith in the resolution process.  However, in instances of noncompliance, we believe parents should be able to request a hearing officer to allow the due process hearing to proceed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In situations where an LEA convenes a meeting with the parent and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint, and the parent fails to participate in the resolution meeting, the LEA would need to continue to make diligent efforts throughout the remainder of the 30-day resolution period to convince the parent to participate in the resolution meeting.  If, however, at the end of the 30-day resolution period, the LEA is still unable to convince the parent to participate in the resolution meeting, we believe that an LEA should be able to seek intervention by a hearing officer to dismiss the complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Therefore, we are adding language to the regulations to allow the parents to seek a hearing officer's intervention in cases where an LEA fails to convene a resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting.  We also are adding language to allow an LEA, at the conclusion of the 30-day resolution period, to request a hearing officer to dismiss a complaint when the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of a parent in a resolution meeting despite making reasonable efforts to do so during the 30-day resolution period.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(4) in Sec. 300.510 to allow an LEA, at the conclusion of the 30-day resolution period to seek the intervention of a hearing officer to dismiss the parent's complaint, if the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting, after reasonable efforts have been made.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We have also added a new paragraph (b)(5) to allow a parent to seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing, if the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters stated that the 45-day timeline for a due process hearing should begin when both parties agree that the complaint will not be resolved in a resolution meeting or mediation session.  Other commenters suggested that when a resolution meeting or mediation session is held and it is clear before the end of the 30-day resolution period that the LEA and the parent cannot resolve the dispute, the 45-day timeline should be allowed to begin prior to the end of the 30-day resolution period.  A few commenters requested further clarification regarding how the timeline is counted once the parent participates in a resolution meeting.  A few commenters recommended that the 45-day timeline for the hearing commence once both parties agree that the issue will not be resolved without a due process hearing.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require the waiver to be in writing so that hearing officers have a specific point in time to know when they should be counting the 45 days.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the due process hearing should be allowed to proceed if the LEA and parent agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting.  We also believe that the due process hearing should be allowed to proceed when an LEA and the parent agree to waive the remainder of the 30-day resolution period when it becomes apparent that the LEA and the parent will be unable to reach agreement through resolution or mediation.  There may also be situations in which both parties agree to continue the mediation session beyond the 30-day resolution period.  Therefore, we are adding language to the regulations to clarify these exceptions to the 30-day resolution period.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The new language specifies that the 45-day timeline for the due process hearing starts the day after one of the following events:  (a) both parties agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting; (b) after either the mediation or resolution meeting starts, but before the end of the 30-day resolution period, both parties agree in writing that no agreement is possible; and (c) if both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of the 30-day resolution period, but later the parent or public agency withdraws from the mediation process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (c) in Sec. 300.510 that specifies adjustments to the 30-day resolution period.  Subsequent paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require public agencies to document their attempts to ensure parent participation in resolution meetings, and to do so in the same manner that they are required to document their attempts to involve parents in IEP Team meetings. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters and will add language to Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to make this clear.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to require an LEA to use the same procedures it uses in Sec. 300.322(d) to document its efforts to obtain the participation of a parent in a resolution meeting.  We also have amended Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to refer to "due process complaints," for clarity.</p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  One commenter asked whether decisions agreed to in resolution meetings supersede previous IEP decisions and whether the IEP Team must reconvene to sanction the decisions made in a resolution meeting.  One commenter recommended that if the resolution agreement includes IEP-related matters, the agreement must state that the LEA will convene an IEP Team meeting within a specific number of days to revise the IEP accordingly or develop an IEP addendum, as appropriate.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Unless the agreement specifically requires that the IEP Team reconvene, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires the IEP Team to reconvene following a resolution agreement that includes IEP-related matters.  We do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to anticipate the elements of a particular settlement agreement, which may supersede an existing IEP.  The contents of settlement agreements are left to the parties who execute a settlement agreement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify whether the SEA, a hearing officer, or an administrative law judge has the authority to enforce a written resolution agreement.  A few commenters recommended permitting a parent to seek assistance from the SEA to compel a school district to abide by a resolution agreement.  The commenters stated that many families cannot afford legal representation and, in jurisdictions in which parents cannot represent themselves at the Federal district court level, this would, in essence, leave such parents without meaningful redress, except through the State court system.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter recommended that the regulations specify that a resolution agreement is enforceable in court without exhausting administrative remedies.  The commenter stated that unless this is clearly stated, parents may be forced to proceed through a two-tier due process system, rather than proceed directly to court, which would be counter to the purpose of a resolution agreement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters suggested adding language in Sec. 300.506(b)(7) clarifying that a written, signed mediation agreement can be enforced through a State's administrative complaint process, as well as in State and Federal court.  The commenters stated that such a provision would be consistent with Congressional intent to reduce litigation and permit parties to resolve disagreements in a more positive, less costly manner.  The commenters also suggested permitting State- or circuit-based variation in enforcement mechanisms.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act provides that if an agreement is reached in a resolution meeting, the parties must execute a legally binding agreement that is signed by both the parent and a representative of the agency who has the authority to bind the agency, and is enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.  These same requirements apply to agreements reached through mediation sessions, pursuant to section 615(e)(2)(F)(iii) of the Act. The Act is clear that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required since the Act provides that the agreement is enforceable in a State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a party to a resolution agreement or a mediation agreement believes that the agreement has been breached, we believe that, in addition to enforcement in a State court of competent jurisdiction or district court of the United States, States should be able to offer the option of using other available State mechanisms (e.g., State complaint procedures) to enforce resolution agreements and mediation agreements, as long as those other enforcement mechanisms are voluntary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Therefore, we are adding a new regulation on State enforcement mechanisms to clarify that States have the option of allowing resolution agreements and mediation agreements to be enforced through other mechanisms, provided that the other enforcement mechanisms do not operate to deny or delay the right of any party to the agreement to seek enforcement in an appropriate State or Federal court.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Regarding the commenters' suggestion of allowing State and circuit variations in enforcement mechanisms, we do not believe the Department has the authority to regulate in this area because doing so would interfere with matters reserved for State and Federal courts.  In general, a written resolution or mediation agreement is a binding contract between the parties, and therefore, the validity and enforceability of that agreement would be reviewed in light of applicable State and Federal laws, including State contract laws.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new Sec. 300.537 on State enforcement mechanisms to clarify that, notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 300.506(b)(7) and new Sec. 300.510(d)(2)(proposed Sec. 300.510(c)(2)), nothing in this part prevents a State from providing parties to a written agreement reached as a result of a mediation or resolution meeting other mechanisms to enforce that agreement, provided that such mechanisms are not mandatory and do not deny or delay the right of the parties to seek enforcement of the written agreement in a State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.  We have also added a cross reference to new Sec. 300.537 in new Sec. 300.510(d) (proposed Sec. 300.510(c)), regarding written settlement agreements. </p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended including language in the regulations to ensure that parents are informed orally and in writing that either party to a resolution agreement may reconsider and void the resolution agreement within three business days.  One commenter expressed concern that some parents lack the education or legal expertise of school districts, and will miss this important right unless informed both orally and in writing.  A few commenters stated that this notice must be provided to parents in their native language or primary mode of communication.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(a), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, requires a public agency to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice at least one time in a school year and under the exceptional circumstances specified in Sec. 300.504(a), which includes the first occurrence of the filing of a due process complaint in a school year.  The procedural safeguards notice, which must be written in language understandable to the general public and in the native language of the parent, unless clearly not feasible to do so, must include a full explanation of the Act's procedural safeguards.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, Sec. 300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means for the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.  Under Sec. 300.504(c)(5)(ii), the notice must inform parents about the opportunity to present and resolve a due process complaint in accordance with the resolution process required in Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, including a party's right to void the resolution agreement within three business days of execution.  We believe it would be overly burdensome to require public agencies to provide the procedural safeguards notice both orally and in writing to an individual parent, and, therefore, decline to change the regulation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether discussions during the resolution meeting remain confidential.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We decline to regulate on this matter because the Act is silent regarding the confidentiality of resolution discussions.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit the parties from entering into a confidentiality agreement as part of their resolution agreement.  A State could not, however, require that the participants in a resolution meeting keep the discussions confidential or make a confidentiality agreement a condition of a parent's participation in the resolution meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations require each SEA to develop a model settlement agreement form with appropriate release language, a withdrawal form to be filed with the hearing officer, and a confidentiality agreement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The terms of settlement agreements will necessarily vary based on numerous factors, including the nature of the dispute and the specific resolution agreed to by the parties involved.  Therefore, we do not believe it is practical or useful to require SEAs to develop a model settlement agreement form.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

All references to day in Sec. 300.510 are calendar days, except for new Sec. 300.510(e) (proposed Sec. 300.510(d)), which specifies that the parties may void a resolution agreement within three business days of the agreement's execution.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that section 615(f)(1)(A) of the Act refers to when a due process complaint is "received" and recommended using this language in Sec. 300.511(a), which refers to when a due process complaint is "filed."  The commenter stated that LEAs are more likely to understand and relate to when a due process complaint is "received" versus when a due process complaint is "filed."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter and are changing Sec. 300.511(a) to be consistent with section 615(f)(1)(A) of the Act, which provides that a parent or the LEA must have the opportunity for an impartial due process hearing under this part when a due process complaint is received under section 615(b)(6) or (k) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  For consistency with statutory language, we have changed the first clause in the first sentence of Sec. 300.511(a) by removing the words "filed under Sec. 300.507" and adding in their place the words "received under Sec. 300.507 or Sec. 300.532".  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that a party has a right to seek immediate intervention from a hearing officer to resolve pre-hearing issues and disputes.  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that hearing officers are empowered and obligated to promptly hear and decide all pre-hearing issues and disputes so that decisions can be made about whether to proceed to a hearing, as well as to focus and streamline the evidentiary hearing process.  The commenter provided the following examples of pre-hearing issues that should be resolved prior to a hearing:  the sufficiency of the complaint; the sufficiency of the response and notice pursuant to Sec. 300.508(e); the sufficiency of the response pursuant to Sec. 300.508(f); motions for stay-put; the hearing schedule; the order of witnesses; the burden of proof; the burden of going forward; witness testimony by telephone or video conference; production of records; exchange of evidence; admissibility of evidence; and issuance and enforcement of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(c)(2)(D) and (E) of the Act, respectively, address situations where it is necessary for hearing officers to make determinations regarding the sufficiency of a complaint and amendments to a complaint before a due process hearing.  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate further on the other pre-hearing issues and decisions mentioned by the commenters because we believe that States should have considerable latitude in determining appropriate procedural rules for due process hearings as long as they are not inconsistent with the basic elements of due process hearings and rights of the parties set out in the Act and these regulations.  The specific application of those procedures to particular cases generally should be left to the discretion of hearing officers who have the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with standard legal practice.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a hearing officer from making determinations on procedural matters not addressed in the Act so long as such determinations are made in a manner that is consistent with a parent's or a public agency's right to a timely due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the Act does not provide adequate guidance on the specific set of legal procedures that must be followed in conducting a due process hearing and recommended that the regulations include guidance regarding the following:  limiting the use of hearsay testimony; requiring all testimony to be subject to cross-examination; the order of testimony; timelines; and the statute of limitations.  The commenter stated that while timelines and the statute of limitations are addressed in the Act, there are no consequences for failure to comply.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In addition to addressing timelines, hearing rights, and statutes of limitations, the Act and these regulations also address a significant due process right relating to the impartiality and qualifications of hearing officers.  Under Section 615(f)(3) of the Act and Sec. 300.511(c), a hearing officer must possess the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard legal practice.  Hearing officers consider failure to comply with timelines and statutes of limitations on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  We believe that the requirements for hearing officers are sufficient to ensure that proper legal procedures are used and that it is not appropriate to regulate on every applicable  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The requirements in Sec. 300.511(c)(1)(iii) and (iv) incorporate the requirements in section 615(f)(3)(A)(iii) and (iv) of the Act.  These requirements are general in nature and appropriately reflect the fact that standard legal practice will vary depending on the State in which the hearing is held.

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require hearing officers to receive ongoing, periodic professional development regarding new regulations and court decisions so that their decisions reflect the latest developments and interpretations.  A few commenters recommended requiring SEAs to provide training for hearing officers by trainers who are experienced in conducting hearings and writing decisions in accordance with standard legal practice.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations require hearing officers to be informed that they are bound by the decisions of courts that govern their jurisdiction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to regulate in the manner recommended by the commenters because this is a responsibility of each State.

Pursuant to its general supervisory responsibility, each State must ensure that individuals selected to conduct impartial due process hearings meet the requirements in Sec. 300.511(c)(1)(ii) through (iv).  States are in the best position to determine the required training and the frequency of the required training, consistent with State rules and policies.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter noted that the Act does not include the provision in Sec. 300.511(c)(2), which provides that a person who otherwise qualifies to conduct a hearing is not an employee of the agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a hearing officer.  The commenter, therefore, recommended removing Sec. 300.511(c)(2).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that the provision should be removed.  This provision is longstanding.  Although the Act prohibits an individual who is employed by a public agency involved in the education or care of the child to be a hearing officer, we believe that it is important to continue to clarify that a person's payment for serving as a hearing officer does not render that individual a public agency employee who is excluded from serving as a hearing officer.  In many instances, public agencies retain hearing officers under contract.  The fact that an individual is hired by a public agency solely for the purpose of serving as a hearing officer does not create an excluded employee relationship.  Public agencies need to ensure that hearing officers conduct due process hearings and it is only reasonable that those persons are paid for their work as hearing officers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Public agencies must maintain a list of persons who serve as hearing officers and a statement of their qualifications.  However, there is nothing in the Act that requires a public agency to make information regarding the qualifications of hearing officers available to the public.  Parents do not select the hearing officer to hear their complaints.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to require public agencies to provide information regarding the qualifications of hearing officers to the public, and we decline to regulate in this regard.  The commenter's recommendation would impose an additional burden on public agencies that is not required by the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. ---, 126 S. Ct. 528 (2005) (Schaffer), the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the school district.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  In addition, we are not aware of significant questions regarding the burden of production that would require regulation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.511(f), consistent with section 615(f)(3)(D) of the Act, provides explicit exceptions to the statute of limitations for filing a due process complaint.

Sec. 300.503(c) and 300.504(d), respectively.  Additionally, in States using the timeline in Sec. 300.511(e) (i.e., "within two years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint"), hearing officers will have to make determinations, on a case-by-case basis, of factors affecting whether the parent "knew or should have known" about the action that is the basis of the complaint.

Hearing Rights (Sec.  300.512)

Comment: Several commenters supported proposed Sec.  300.512 
stating that a parent's right to be represented by non-attorneys at due 
process hearings is best decided by State law. Other commenters 
disagreed with our statement in the preamble to the NPRM that the 
language of the Act is not clear about whether non-attorneys can 
represent parties in due process hearings. These commenters stated that 
the Act and its implementing regulations both provide that any party to 
a hearing shall be accorded the right to be accompanied and advised 
``by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with 
respect to the problems of children with disabilities * * *.'' The 
commenters stated that because the term ``counsel'' is referenced 
separately and distinguished from ``individuals with special knowledge 
or training'' in both the Act and the regulations, the Department 
should conclude that such ``individuals'' may, in fact, be other than 
counsel (i.e., attorneys) and represent a parent in a due process 
hearing. One commenter noted that experienced advocates can be very 
helpful to parents who represent themselves in due process hearings. 
Another commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 should not permit 
a State's rules related to the unauthorized practice of law to prohibit 
a parent from being ``accompanied and advised'' by a lay advocate 
because this would be contrary to the actual text of the Act. Moreover, 
several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 violates the 
intent of the Act, which they describe as providing parents with the 
broadest opportunities for assistance in due process hearings. These 
commenters stated further that nothing in the language or intent of the 
Act permits the Department's interpretation that States have the 
authority to decide whether parents can be represented by non-attorneys 
in due process hearings under the Act.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 615(h)(1) of the Act is clear that parties to a 
due process hearing may be ``accompanied and advised'' by counsel and 
by individuals, such as non-attorney advocates, who have special 
knowledge or training regarding the problems of children with 
disabilities. Nothing in these regulations or State law can limit this 
right. However, neither the Act nor the current regulations 
implementing Part B of the Act address the issue of whether individuals 
who are not attorneys, but have special knowledge or training regarding 
the problems of children with disabilities, may ``represent'' parties 
in due process hearings under the Act. Congress considered the question 
of non-attorney representation during the 2003-2004 IDEA 
reauthorization process. The version of H.R. 1350 passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2003 included a provision giving a party the 
``right to be represented by counsel and by non-attorney advocates and 
to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or 
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities'' 
(63 Cong. Rec. H3458 and H3495 (daily ed. Apr. 30, 2003)). The final 
version of the bill enacted in 2004, however, did not adopt this 
language. In other areas, though, the Act, as revised in 2004, now 
specifically addresses duties applicable to ``either party, or the 
attorney representing a party'' (see section 615(b)(7)(A) and (B) of 
the Act). Given that the Act is silent regarding the representational 
role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of 
whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties to a due process 
hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to 
decide. As the commenter notes, even if a State law prohibits non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, the Act still affords 
parties to due process hearings the right to be accompanied and advised 
by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
problems of children with disabilities.

Comment: Several commenters expressed dissatisfaction with proposed 
Sec.  300.512 because it would give too much deference to States, 
permit inconsistent rules across States, and would limit a party's 
right under Federal law to be represented by a non-attorney in a due 
process hearing based on States' interest in regulating the practice of 
law. Other commenters stated that federalism concerns should not 
override the national interest, reflected in the Act, in the equal 
opportunity of children with disabilities to appropriate education.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: As noted elsewhere in this preamble, the Act does not 
state that parties to a due process hearing have a right to 
representation in those hearings by non-attorney advocates. Given the 
Act's silence in this regard, the Act does not prevent States from 
regulating whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties in due 
process hearings.

Comment: One commenter requested that the final regulations clarify 
whether it is sufficient for an SEA to provide by regulation or procedural rule 
that a lay advocate may represent parties at due process hearings or 
whether the ability of a lay advocate to represent a party at a due 
process hearing instead is controlled by State law regarding the 
unauthorized practice of law. Another commenter requested that we add a 
provision to the regulations to clarify that nothing in the Act 
authorizes parents to be represented by non-attorneys if State law is 
silent on the issue.

Discussion: Whether an SEA may have a State regulation or 
procedural rule permitting non-attorney advocates to represent parties 
at due process hearings or whether that issue is controlled by State 
attorney practice laws is determined by State law. If State law is 
silent on the question of whether non-attorney advocates can represent 
parties in due process hearings, there is no prohibition under the Act 
or its implementing regulations on non-attorney advocates assuming a 
representational role in due process hearings.

Comment: Many commenters asserted that the proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 would negatively affect future cases as parents unable to 
afford attorneys' fees, or unable to find an attorney knowledgeable 
about special education law, will be faced with the choice of either 
representing themselves or foregoing a due process hearing. Other 
commenters suggested that the proposed regulatory change has the 
potential to disrupt the State system of administrative due process 
hearings when lay advocates are not available to assist parents. One 
commenter noted that lay advocates are necessary to help represent 
parents because school officials are more knowledgeable about the law 
than parents, and there are more school lawyers than there are lawyers 
willing to represent parents in due process hearings. Some commenters 
noted that publicly funded programs providing legal representation to 
persons with disabilities are not funded at the level that meets the 
need for free or low-cost assistance. Another commenter noted that non-
attorney advocates provide a necessary and valuable service to children 
with disabilities, and that limiting the role of non-attorney advocates 
will adversely affect the rights of children with disabilities in due 
process hearings. Other commenters argued that lay advocates serve an 
important function and are an excellent resource for families.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree with the commenters that non-attorney 
advocates can perform a valuable service to parties in due process 
hearings. As just one example, non-attorney advisors with special 
knowledge of or training in the problems of children with disabilities 
who speak languages other than English can play an important role in 
accompanying and advising parents who do not speak English at due 
process hearings. However, because the Act is silent about the 
representational role of non-attorneys in due process hearings, States 
are not prohibited by the Act from regulating on that issue. Therefore, 
we make clear, in Sec.  300.512, that whether non-attorneys can 
``represent'' parties in due process hearings is a matter that is 
controlled by State law. There currently are States that prohibit non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, and parties to due 
process hearings in those States need to understand that they may not 
be ``represented'' in a due process hearing by a non-attorney, although 
they may be ``accompanied and advised'' by a non-attorney in the due 
process hearing if that individual has special knowledge or training 
respecting the problems of children with disabilities.

Comment: A few commenters recommended that States be required to 
provide parents with a list of available and affordable attorneys if 
State law does not allow for non-attorney representation in due process

representation by knowledgeable attorneys when legal counsel is 
necessary, such as appealing due process decisions in court.

Discussion: Current Sec.  300.507 requires public agencies to 
inform a parent of any free or low-cost legal and other relevant

parent or public agency files a due process complaint. We expect States 
to work to ensure that parents for whom legal counsel under Part B of 
the Act is necessary have easy access to information about free or low-
cost legal or other relevant services available in their area. Each 
State is in the best position to determine effective strategies to 
ensure that parents have access to information about free or low-cost 
assistance. For these reasons, we decline to make the requested changes 
to these regulations.

Comment: One commenter opposed the proposed changes to Sec.  
300.512 and expressed concern that these changes will limit parents'

decision-making process for their child under the Act, and therefore, 
should be able to utilize non-attorney assistance whenever necessary. 
Some commenters stated that effective advocacy is necessary to ensure 
that children have access to the services and programs necessary to 
develop an appropriate IEP.

Discussion: We agree with commenters that parents should be equal

that parents should be able to utilize assistance from non-attorney 
advocates whenever necessary, such as in securing an appropriate IEP 
for their child and, as noted previously in this preamble, in preparing 
for and participating in due process hearings. The proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 only address whether a party can be represented by a non-
attorney in a due process hearing, specifying that this matter is 
determined by State law. Whether parents may be ``represented'' by non-
attorney advocates at other stages of the process is not addressed by 
the Act and also depends on State law. That said, under Sec.  
300.321(a)(6), the IEP Team may include, at the discretion of the 
parent or public agency, individuals who have knowledge or special 
expertise regarding the child, including non-attorney advocates. While 
these individuals are members of the IEP Team, their role is not to

Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec.  
300.512 could lead to confusion because not all States have a clear 
position as to whether lay advocates can represent parents at due 
process hearings. Some of these commenters noted that 10 States 
currently bar lay advocates, 12 States permit lay advocates to 
represent parents in due process hearings, and that the positions of 
the remaining States are unclear. Given this disparity across States, 
these commenters expressed concern that leaving the decision to States 
could lead to more confusion and litigation, not less. A few commenters 
questioned whether States would be required to amend their laws to 
specify whether lay advocates can represent parties in due process 
hearings.

One commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 raises an issue to 
the national level that is only a problem in a few jurisdictions, and 
would lead to increased, and tangential, disputes. Another commenter 
stated that appropriate representation should remain a matter of State law, but 
that the Department should not make the changes proposed to Sec.  
300.512 in the NPRM.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We disagree with commenters that confusion will result 
from the changes reflected in proposed Sec.  300.512. To the contrary, 
we expect that the effect of this amended provision will be to reduce 
confusion and the potential for litigation because parties will know to 
look to State law to determine whether non-attorneys can represent 
parties in due process hearings; States will know they are free to 
continue to permit or prohibit such representation. In the absence of 
State law on this point, there is nothing in the Act or these 
regulations that would prohibit non-attorneys with special knowledge or 
training respecting the problems of children with disabilities from 
representing parties in due process hearings. Nothing in proposed Sec.  
300.512 requires States to adopt changes to State law to address this 
issue.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Even though a relatively small number of States may prohibit non-
attorneys from representing parties in IDEA due process hearings, it is 
still important for the Department to address this issue in its 
regulations. In the absence of that clarification, parties may not 
consider this issue at the time they are making decisions about how to 
proceed in a due process hearing, or may mistakenly rely on the April 
8, 1981 letter from Theodore Sky, Acting General Counsel of the 
Department of Education, to the Honorable Frank B. Brouillet, in which 
the Department interpreted section 615 of the Act and implementing 
regulations to mean that attorneys and lay advocates may perform the 
same functions at due process hearings. As noted in the NPRM, the 
Department no longer interprets section 615 of the Act and implementing 
regulations in this manner. Nothing in amended Sec.  300.512 should 
increase disputes, or raise an issue that is not already an issue under 
State law.

Some commenters stated that State regulations of the practice of law

reported that lay advocates commonly represent a school district, but 
are not subject to license-based sanctions or censure or held to the

that school districts are often ``represented'' at hearings by agency 
representatives, including special education directors or other

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that a further change is 
needed to Sec.  300.512 to specify that State law controls whether non-
attorneys can represent any party in a due process hearing under the 
Act. We are persuaded by commenters who pointed out that public 
agencies also retain non-attorney advocates, and agree that the Act's 
silence on the matter of non-attorney representation in a due process 
hearing means that State law applies to all parties to a due process 
hearing.

Comment: Several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512

regulation that procedurally or substantively lessens the protections 
provided to children with disabilities in the regulations in effect on 
July 20, 1983 unless the regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal 
intent of Congress in legislation. These commenters noted that proposed 
Sec.  300.512 was not in effect in 1983 and that no legislative change 
has been made to the right ``to be accompanied and advised by counsel 
and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to 
the problems of children with disabilities.''

Discussion: We disagree that the change reflected in proposed Sec.

regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983 did not address 
whether non-attorneys could ``represent'' parties to due process 
hearings, the regulations in effect at that time did not embody a right 
to representation by non-attorneys. Section 607 of the Act does not 
prevent the Department from addressing rights that were not in the

Comment: A number of commenters stated that the issue of whether to 
allow parents to be represented by non-lawyers in IDEA due process 
hearings should be left to Congress to resolve. Many of these 
commenters stated that given the pending reauthorization of the Act, 
regulating on this topic is premature. Some commenters stated that this 
issue should be reviewed in Congressional oversight hearings. Many 
commenters argued that there is a need for review and consideration of 
available research data, or that research should first be conducted on 
the special education administrative due process systems of States and 
districts, before a change is made. Others called for research on the 
availability of legal representation for parents in due process 
hearings before a change in the Department's policy is made.
Discussion: We disagree with commenters that this matter should be 
left to Congress to resolve or that it is premature to address this 
issue given the pending reauthorization of the Act. Participants in due 
process hearings should understand that, under the current state of the 
law, the Act does not prohibit States from determining whether parties 
to due process hearings can be represented in those hearings by non-
attorneys. We also disagree with commenters that additional research is 
needed to better understand the current state of State law on this 
issue before amending Sec.  300.512. That said, we agree that 
additional information about the availability of legal representation 
for parties might be useful in helping Congress decide whether a change 
in the statute is advisable.

Comment: A number of commenters remarked that Congressional 
inaction on the issue of lay advocate representation of parties in due 
process hearings after the Arons decision indicates that Congress did 
not mean to reverse the Department's longstanding policy that the Act 
permits non-attorney representation.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We do not agree that Congressional acquiescence in the 
Department's prior interpretation can be inferred in this case. The 
commenters' assessment of the reasons that Congress decided to take no 
action in this regard is speculative. Congress was aware, at the time 
of the 2004 reauthorization, that non-attorneys were not permitted to 
represent parties in due process hearings in at least one State, 
Delaware. Therefore, we cannot assume that Congressional inaction meant 
that Congress viewed the Department's prior interpretation as 
controlling. Lack of congressional action could also mean that Congress 
believed that the Arons case was correctly decided, and that State law 
should control the representational role of non-attorneys in IDEA due 
process hearings.

Comment:  Some commenters requested that the regulations clarify that LRE is a substantive, not a procedural, issue and that a hearing officer can base relief on the failure of an LEA to provide FAPE in the LRE to the maximum extent possible.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations allow a hearing officer to dismiss a complaint or to rule on summary judgment if there is no claim or controversy to be adjudicated.  The commenters stated that hearing officers should be allowed to dismiss cases when the alleged violation does not focus on a substantive issue.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.513(a)(1) and section 615(f)(3)(E) of the Act provide that, in general, a decision made by a hearing officer must be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received FAPE.  Furthermore, Sec. 300.513(a)(3), consistent with section 615(f)(3)(E)(iii) of the Act, allows a hearing officer to order an LEA to comply with procedural requirements under Sec. Sec. 300.500 through 300.536.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Although the Act and these regulations require that hearing officers base determinations of whether a child received FAPE on substantive grounds, hearing officers also may find that a child did not receive FAPE based on the specific procedural inadequacies set out in Sec. 300.513(a)(2), consistent with section 615(f)(3)(E)(ii) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Hearing officers continue to have the discretion to dismiss complaints and to make rulings on matters in addition to those concerning the provision of FAPE, such as the other matters mentioned in Sec. 300.507(a)(1).  To clarify this point, we are revising the heading of Sec. 300.513(a) to refer to decisions of hearing officers about FAPE, and are revising Sec. 300.513(a)(1).  The requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.508 governing the content of the due process complaint, including requirements for sufficiency and complaint amendment, and requirements governing the resolution process in Sec. 300.510 should help to ensure that due process complaints that are the subject of a due process hearing under this part contain claims that are appropriate for a hearing officer's decision. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the 90-day timeline for a party aggrieved by the findings and decision of a due process hearing to file a civil action begins either from the date of a hearing officer's decision or from the date of a State review officer's decision, if the State has a two-tiered due process system.  One commenter stated that many cases would be inappropriately dismissed if this regulation is not clarified.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters and are clarifying that the party bringing the action has 90 days from the date of the decision of the hearing officer or the decision of the State review official to file a civil action, or, if the State has an explicit time limitation for bringing civil actions under Part B of the Act, in the time allowed by that State law.  This change is needed to ensure that the applicable time limitation does not penalize parties in States with two-tier due process systems that require a party aggrieved by the due process hearing officer's decision to file a State-level appeal prior to bringing a civil action in State or Federal court.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the State time limit for bringing a civil action under Part B of the Act can only be used if it is longer than 90 days.

Discussion:  Parents involved in a due process hearing would already have received information about the availability of a civil action and the timeline for filing a civil action when they received the procedural safeguards notice, in accordance with Sec. 300.504.

Comment:  We received a number of comments seeking clarification of, or modifications to, the statutory language governing the award of attorneys' fees.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the SEA or LEA to affirmatively prove that the parent's intent was improper in order to be awarded attorneys' fees under this provision.  A few commenters recommended modifying the regulations to expressly require a determination by a court that the complaint or cause of action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, before an award of attorneys' fees can be considered.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that section 615(i)(3)(B)(i) of the Act seeks to codify the standards set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), and that the principles set forth in this action (that attorneys' fees may only be awarded to defendants in actions where the plaintiffs' claims are frivolous, without foundation, or brought in bad faith) should apply in favor of school districts and parents, since either party can bring complaints. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) be revised to refer to an attorney of a parent or a parent because there are many parents who are attorneys representing their children in due process hearings.  Another commenter recommended including language that the parent must be the prevailing party on substantive grounds in order to claim an award of attorneys' fees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.517(a) incorporates the language in section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act.  Further guidance on the interpretation of this statutory language is not appropriate since judicial interpretations of statutory provisions will necessarily vary based upon case-by-case factual determinations, consistent with the requirement that the award of reasonable attorneys' fees is left to a court's discretion.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the recommendation that we include language that the parent must be the prevailing party on substantive grounds, we decline to regulate because we believe that the statutory provisions regarding attorneys' fees are appropriately described in Sec. 300.517.  Furthermore, section 615(f)(3)(E) of the Act, reflected in Sec. 300.513, recognizes both that hearing officer determinations that a child did not receive FAPE, in some circumstances, may be based on procedural violations, and that hearing officers may order LEAs to comply with procedural requirements.  Either of these circumstances, in appropriate cases, might result in a parent being determined to be a prevailing party for purposes of claiming attorneys' fees.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We decline to add language to Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(ii) to refer to a parent who is an attorney, because the reference to "an attorney of a parent" would include anyone serving as an attorney.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that Sec. 300.517(a)(1)(iii), regarding attorneys' fees, be changed to include non-attorney advocates who are acting on behalf of parents and provide that these individuals be held to the same standard as attorneys.  Another commenter expressed concern regarding circuit court rulings that require SEAs to pay for expert witnesses for parents who cannot afford them.  The commenter recommended that the regulations permit SEAs to establish a list of private experts who are willing to testify at due process hearings and to use funds provided under Part B of the Act to pay such experts when either party uses them.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(i)(3)(B) of the Act allows a court to award reasonable attorneys' fees as a part of the costs to a parent who is the prevailing party.  Although the Act also provides parents with the right to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities at a due process hearing, it does not provide for awarding attorneys' fees to these other individuals.  Lay advocates are, by definition, not attorneys and are not entitled to compensation as if they were attorneys.  In addition, consistent with the Supreme Court's recent decision in Arlington Central Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, No. 05-18, U.S., 2006 U.S. LEXIS 5162 (June 26, 2006), if Congress wishes to allow recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents, it must include explicit language authorizing that recovery, which was not done in the Act.

Comment:  One commenter stated that attorneys' fees should be available for resolution meetings because parents are required to attend these meetings before a due process hearing can begin.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that the prohibition on attorneys' fees for resolution activities applies to the resolution meeting, as well as any resolution agreement.  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that attorneys' fees for resolution meetings will not be paid until a compromise is reached, and will be based on the resolution meeting itself and not the work that the attorney puts into preparing for the resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.517(c)(2)(iii) of the regulations, consistent with section 615(i)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act, specifies that the resolution meeting is not considered to be a meeting convened as a result of an administrative hearing or judicial action or an administrative hearing or judicial action for purposes of the attorneys' fees provision.  Accordingly, such fees may not be awarded for resolution meetings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
While it is clear that attorneys' fees may not be awarded for resolution meetings, the Act is silent as to whether attorneys' fees are available for activities that occur outside the resolution meeting conducted pursuant to section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act and Sec. 300.510(a).

Discussion:  Section 615(i)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act permits States to determine whether attorneys' fees may be awarded for an IEP Team meeting that results from a mediation session described in Sec. 300.506.

Discussion:  It would be inappropriate to include a standard for determining whether a parent is substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer because such matters will depend on the specific facts and circumstances in each case.  The hearing officer, as the designated trier of fact under the Act, is in the best position to determine whether a parent was substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer.

Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that an IFSP is not a child's pendent placement as the child transitions from a Part C early intervention program to a Part B preschool program.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The programs under Parts B and C of the Act differ in their scope, eligibility, and the services available.  Services under Part B of the Act are generally provided in a school setting.  By contrast, services under Part C of the Act are provided, to the maximum extent appropriate, in the natural environment, which is often the infant or toddler's home or other community program designed for typically developing infants or toddlers.  The Department has long interpreted the current educational placement language in the stay-put provisions in section 615(j) of the Act and Sec. 300.518(a) as referring only to the child's placement under Part B of the Act and not to the early intervention services received by the child under Part C of the Act.  We believe that a child who previously received services under Part C of the Act, but has turned three and is no longer eligible under Part C of the Act, and is applying for initial services under Part B of the Act, does not have a "current educational placement."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are adding language to clarify that if the complaint involves an application for initial services under Part B of the Act from a child who has turned three and is no longer eligible under Part C of the Act, the public agency is not required to continue providing the early intervention services on the child's IFSP.  The provision clarifies that a public agency must obtain parental consent prior to the initial provision of special education and related services, consistent with Sec. 300.300(b), and if a child is eligible under Part B of the Act and the parent provides consent under Sec. 300.300(b), the public agency must provide those special education and related services that are not in dispute between the parent and the public agency.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (c) in Sec. 300.518 to clarify the Department's longstanding policy that if a complaint involves an application for initial services under Part B of the Act from a child who has turned three and is no longer eligible under Part C of the Act, the public agency is not required to continue providing the early intervention services on the child's IFSP.  Proposed Sec. 300.518(c) has been redesignated as new Sec. 300.518(d).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.518 to clearly state that during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding, LEAs are not absolved of their obligation to fully comply with all substantive and procedural requirements in Part B of the Act, with the exception of requirements that are impossible to fulfill because of the stay put order or because of a parent's refusal. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that the change requested by the commenter is necessary.  Section 615(j) of the Act and Sec. 300.518 provide that during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507, except as provided in Sec. 300.533, unless the parent and the SEA or LEA agree to a proposed change in the educational placement of the child, the child remains in the current educational placement.  Implicit in maintaining a child's current educational placement is the requirement that the public agency must ensure that FAPE continues to be made available to the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that stay put not apply to a child if the child's parent fails to participate in a resolution meeting.  Another commenter expressed concern about the applicability of the stay put provision when resolution meetings are delayed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act now makes the resolution process a prerequisite to an impartial due process hearing.  Under section 615(j) of the Act, a child must be maintained in the current educational placement while proceedings under the Act are pending, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.518 clarifies that unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current educational placement during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507.  Thus, the Act is clear that the public agency must maintain the child's current educational placement during the pendency of the 30-day resolution process, which is triggered once the parent files a due process complaint under this part, regardless of whether the due process complaint is resolved prior to a due process hearing.  We believe it is important for this to be clear in the procedural safeguards notice.  Therefore, we are changing Sec. 300.504(c)(7) to clarify that the notice must inform parents about the child's placement during the pendency of any due process complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Since a party must file a due process complaint as the first step in the hearing process, we also are making a change in Sec. 300.518(a) to refer to a due process complaint, rather than a request for a due process hearing.  This change is needed to clarify that a child's right to remain in the current educational placement attaches when a due process complaint is filed, regardless of whether the due process complaint results in a request for a due process hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the reference in Sec. 300.504(c)(7) to due process "hearings" and added "any due process complaint" to clarify that the procedural safeguards notice must include information regarding the child's placement during the pendency of any due process complaint.  We also have changed Sec. 300.518 by removing the words "request for a due process hearing" prior to the reference to Sec. 300.507 and adding, in their place, the words "due process complaint." </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended including language to invalidate the stay put agreement if the original decision is reversed at the second tier hearing or in a judicial appeal.  One commenter recommended providing interim financial relief for parents if an LEA appeals the decision of a due process hearing officer to maintain a child with a disability in a private school setting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are maintaining the provisions in proposed Sec. 300.518(c), (new Sec. 300.518(d)), but with one modification.  The basis for this regulation is the longstanding judicial interpretation of the Act's pendency provision that when a hearing officer's decision is in agreement with the parent that a change in placement is appropriate, that decision constitutes an agreement by the State agency and the parent for purposes of determining the child's current placement during subsequent appeals.  See, e.g., Burlington School Committee v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Susquenita School District v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 84 (3rd Cir. 1996); Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Administrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635, 641 (9th Cir. 1990).  To clarify that new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) does not apply to a first-tier due process hearing decision in a State that has two tiers of administrative review, but only to a State-level hearing officer's decision in a one-tier system or State review official's decision in a two-tier system that is in favor of a parent's proposed placement, we are removing the reference to "local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d).  This change is made to align the regulation more closely with case law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the concern about providing financial relief for prevailing parents when an LEA appeals the decision of a due process hearing to maintain a child with a disability in a private school setting, we decline to regulate on this issue because such decisions are matters best left to State law, hearing officers, and courts. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed "or local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) because a decision by a hearing officer or a State review official in favor of a parent's proposed placement is an agreement between the parent and the State, not the local agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that any agreement by a parent to waive the stay put protection must comply with the requirements for consent in Sec. 300.9.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Consent is required when a pending complaint involves an application for initial admission to public school.  In this case, parental consent is required for the child to be placed in the public school until the completion of all proceedings, consistent with Sec. 300.518(b) and section 615(j) of the Act.  Other waivers of the stay put protections while an administrative or judicial proceeding is pending, need only be by agreement between the parent and the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Students with disabilities in State correctional facilities do not have an automatic right to a surrogate parent solely by reason of their confinement at a correctional facility.  Public agencies must make case-by-case determinations in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 300.519, regarding whether a student with a disability in a State correctional facility needs a surrogate parent. Whether a student with a disability confined in a State correctional facility is considered a ward of the State, as defined in new Sec. 300.45 (proposed Sec. 300.44) whose rights must be protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent, is a matter that must be determined under State law. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

We do not believe that it is necessary to define "locate" in these regulations because it has the same meaning as the common meaning of the term.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A number of comments were received regarding the procedures for assigning surrogate parents.  One commenter recommended requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one.  The commenter stated that this would avoid situations in which the LEA and juvenile court each believe that the other is assuming this responsibility and a surrogate parent is never appointed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended that the process for assigning surrogate parents within the 30-day timeframe be developed in collaboration with judges and other child advocates.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the involvement of child welfare agencies, homeless liaisons, and any other party who has knowledge about the needs of homeless children or children in foster care in determining whether a surrogate parent is needed. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to amend the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenters.  To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected, Sec. 300.519(b) requires public agencies to have a method for determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent and for assigning a surrogate parent to a child.  Such methods would include determining whether a court has already appointed a surrogate parent, as provided under Sec. 300.519(c).  Therefore, it is unnecessary to add language requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one, as requested by a commenter.  Section 300.519(d)(1) allows a public agency to select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law, and Sec. 300.519(h) requires the SEA to make reasonable efforts to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe that the determination of whether public agencies collaborate with other parties, such as child welfare agencies or homeless liaisons, in appointing surrogate parents is best left to State discretion.  There is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a public agency from collaborating with judges and child advocates in establishing a process for assigning surrogate parents, as recommended by the commenter.  However, in situations where a public agency involves other parties in determining whether a surrogate parent is needed, the public agency must ensure that the confidentiality of personally identifiable data, information, and records collected or maintained by SEAs and LEAs is protected in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and that the privacy of education records is protected under FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended retaining current Sec. 300.370(b)(2), which specifically mentions the recruitment and training of surrogate parents as a State-level activity for which funds provided under Part B of the Act may be used.  One commenter requested clarification as to who should provide training for surrogate parents.  A few commenters recommended that PTIs in each State be responsible for training surrogate parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to retain current Sec. 300.370(b)(2) in order to permit the continued use of funds provided under Part B of the Act for the recruitment and training of surrogate parents.  Section 300.704(b) and section 611(e)(2)(C)(i) of the Act provide that funds reserved for other State-level activities may be used for support and direct services, including technical assistance, personnel preparation, and professional development and training.  This would include the recruitment and training of surrogate parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Act and these regulations do not address the length of time that a surrogate parent must serve.  Nor do we believe that it would be appropriate to impose a uniform rule in light of the wide variety of circumstances that might arise related to a child's need for a surrogate parent.  Even so, to minimize disruption for the child, public agencies should take steps to ensure that the individual appointed as a surrogate parent can serve in that capacity over the period of time that the child needs a surrogate. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters stated that the requirements for a surrogate parent for public wards of the State (when a judge overseeing a case appoints a surrogate parent) are less stringent than the requirements for surrogate parents for other children.  The commenters stated that the requirements that surrogate parents have no personal or professional interest that conflicts with the interest of the child, and have knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the child, as required in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, should be required for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State.  One commenter recommended that court-appointed surrogate parents should have to meet Federal requirements for surrogate parents, not the requirements promulgated by LEAs.  The commenter stated that courts may have jurisdiction over cases from more than one school district and should not have to apply different standards depending on which school district is involved.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The criteria for selecting surrogate parents in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), which apply to surrogate parents appointed by a public agency for children with disabilities under Part B of the Act, do not apply to the selection of surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State under the laws of the State.  Section 615(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act provides that, in the case of a child who is a ward of the State, a surrogate parent may alternatively be appointed by the judge overseeing the child's care, provided that the surrogate parent is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the child.  We decline to impose additional requirements for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State beyond what is required in the Act, so as to interfere as little as possible with State practice in appointing individuals to act for the child.  However, we would expect that in most situations, the court-appointed individuals will not have personal or professional interests that conflict with the interests of the child and will have the knowledge and skills to adequately represent the interests of the child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that if a parent under Sec. 300.30 is known and the child is a ward of the State, the public agency must appoint a surrogate parent only if the public agency determines that a surrogate parent is needed to protect the educational interests of the child.  The commenter stated that the public agency should not appoint a surrogate parent without approval of a court of competent jurisdiction if the parent is the biological or adoptive parent whose rights to make educational decisions for the child have not been terminated, suspended, or limited. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concern is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.30(b)(1) provides that when there is more than one party attempting to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent must be presumed to be the parent, unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters noted that the regulations do not protect a child who is a ward of the tribe in the same manner as a child who is a ward of the State.

Discussion:  The definition of State in new Sec. 300.40 (proposed Sec. 300.39) is based on section 602(31) of the Act, which does not include an Indian tribe or tribal governing body.  Therefore, the Department does not have the authority to interpret ward of the State to include children who are wards of a tribe of competent jurisdiction.  However this does not relieve States or the BIA of their responsibility to ensure that the rights of a child who is a ward of a tribe are protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent under Sec. 300.519 when no parent can be identified; when the agency cannot, after reasonable efforts, locate a parent; or when the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations require public agencies to develop procedures to terminate the appointment of a surrogate parent if the person does not perform the duties of a surrogate parent.

Discussion:  If a public agency learns that an individual appointed as a surrogate parent is not carrying out the responsibilities of a surrogate parent in Sec. 300.519(g), the public agency, consistent with its obligation to protect the rights of children with disabilities under the circumstances set out in Sec. 300.519(a), would need to take steps to terminate the appointment of a surrogate parent.

Discussion:  As noted in the response to the prior comment, public agencies have a responsibility to ensure that a surrogate parent is carrying out their responsibilities, so there are some circumstances when removal may be appropriate.  A mere disagreement with the decisions of a surrogate parent about appropriate services or placements for the child, however, generally would not be sufficient to give rise to a removal, as the role of the surrogate parent is to represent the interests of the child, which may not be the same as the interests of the public agency.  We do not think a regulation is necessary, however, as we believe that the rights of the child with a disability are adequately protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II), which prohibit retaliation or coercion against any individual who exercises their rights under Federal law for the purpose of assisting children with disabilities by protecting rights protected under those statutes.  See, 34 CFR 104.61, referencing 34 CFR 100.7(e); 28 CFR 35.134.  These statutes generally prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance (Section 504) and prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by State and local governments (Title II).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Section 300.519(f) allows LEAs to appoint a temporary surrogate parent for a child who is an unaccompanied homeless youth, without regard to the requirement in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(i) that a surrogate parent not be an employee of any agency involved in the education or care of the child.  Thus, a temporary surrogate parent for an unaccompanied homeless youth may include State, LEA, or agency staff that is involved in the education or care of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The Act does not specify how long a temporary surrogate parent can represent the child.

Comment:  A few commenters requested a definition of "surrogate parent."  Some commenters stated that Sec. 300.519(g) provides only general parameters regarding the responsibilities of surrogate parents and does not provide guidance on specific duties or responsibilities of surrogate parents.  The commenters stated that, at a minimum, the regulations should require that States develop duties and responsibilities for surrogate parents, such as meeting with the child, participating in meetings, and reviewing the child's education record.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that it is necessary to define "surrogate parent" because Sec. 300.519(g), consistent with section 615(b)(2) of the Act, clarifies that a surrogate parent is an individual who represents the child in all matters related to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child, and the provision of FAPE to the child.  This is a longstanding provision and is intended to describe the areas in which a surrogate parent may represent the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe that the provisions in Sec. 300.519 are sufficient to ensure that public agencies fulfill their obligation to ensure that the rights of children are protected in the circumstances in Sec. 300.519(a).  Therefore, we believe it is unnecessary, and would be over regulating, to specify in these regulations requirements for surrogate parents to meet and get to know the child prior to meetings, as recommended by one commenter.  Likewise, we do not believe that it is necessary to require public agencies to develop specific duties and responsibilities for surrogate parents because public agencies already must ensure that a surrogate parent has the knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the child, consistent with Sec. 300.519(d).  However, if a public agency determined there was a need to specify the duties and responsibilities for surrogate parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit them from doing so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring LEAs to report to the SEA when a child needs a surrogate parent so that the SEA can fulfill its obligation to ensure that surrogate parents are assigned within the 30-day timeframe required in Sec. 300.519(h).  Some commenters requested clarification regarding what it means for the SEA to make "reasonable efforts" to appoint surrogate parents within the 30-day timeframe.  The commenters recommended that SEAs track whether LEAs or courts appoint surrogate parents in a timely manner and provide technical assistance to LEAs and courts that fail to meet the 30-day timeframe. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Some commenters stated that LEAs spend too much time determining that a surrogate parent is needed and prolong the decision that a surrogate parent is needed until the LEA is ready to appoint the surrogate parent.  One commenter stated that children in residential care facilities often have an immediate need for a surrogate parent and waiting 30 days to appoint a surrogate parent could cause lasting damage to a child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be over-regulating to specify the specific "reasonable efforts" that a State must take to ensure that a surrogate parent is appointed within the 30-day timeframe required in Sec. 300.519(h), because what is considered a "reasonable effort" will vary on a case-by-case basis.  We do not believe we should require LEAs to report to the State when a child in their district needs a surrogate parent or to require SEAs to track how long it takes LEAs and courts to appoint surrogate parents because to do so would be unnecessarily burdensome.  States have the discretion to determine how best to monitor the timely appointment of surrogate parents by their LEAs.  States also have discretion to use funds reserved for other State-level activities to provide technical assistance to LEAs and courts that fail to meet the 30-day timeframe, as requested by the commenters.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  To change the regulation in the manner suggested by the commenters would be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 615(m)(1)(D) of the Act allows, but does not require, a State to transfer all rights accorded to parents under Part B of the Act to children who are incarcerated in an adult or juvenile, State or local correctional institution when a child with a disability reaches the age of majority under State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that families are often unaware of the transfer of rights at the age of majority and recommended requiring schools to inform parents and students in writing of the transfer of rights one year prior to the day the student reaches the age of majority.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenters' concerns are addressed elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.320(c), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(VIII)(cc) of the Act, requires that, beginning not later than one year before the child reaches the age of majority under State law, the IEP must include a statement that the child has been informed of the child's rights under Part B of the Act, if any, that will transfer to the child on reaching the age of majority. Section 300.322(f) (proposed Sec. 300.322(e)) requires the public agency to give a copy of the child's IEP to the parent, and, therefore, parents are informed as well. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations allow parents to continue to serve as the decision-maker and to retain the rights under the Act even in situations where the child is not determined to be incompetent under State law, if the student and parent agree in writing that the parent retains such rights.  The commenter stated that a State may not have a mechanism to determine that the child does not have the ability to provide informed consent, as required in Sec. 300.520(b), and if a State does have such a mechanism, it may be costly and time consuming for a parent to go to court to retain such rights.  The commenter stated that an agreement between the parent and student should be a simple process whereby the student and parent both sign a form stating their agreement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.520(b) recognizes that some States have mechanisms to determine that a child with a disability who has reached the age of majority under State law does not have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program, even though the child has not been determined incompetent under State law.  In such States, the State must establish procedures for appointing the parent (or, if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual) to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the remainder of the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Whether parents may retain the ability to make educational decisions for a child who has reached the age of majority and who can provide informed consent is a matter of State laws regarding competency.  That is, the child may be able to grant the parent a power of attorney or similar grant of authority to act on the child's behalf under applicable State law.  We believe that the rights accorded individuals at the age of majority, beyond those addressed in the regulation, are properly matters for States to control.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested clarifying the phrase "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" in Sec. 300.530(a) and what, if any, unique circumstances should be considered.  A few of these commenters requested that the regulations include specific criteria to be used when making a case-by-case determination.  Other commenters suggested clarifying that the purpose of a case-by-case determination is to not allow school personnel to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting for violating a code of student conduct when to do so would seem unjust under the circumstances.  Some commenters suggested clarifying that the purpose of a case-by-case determination is to limit, not expand, disciplinary actions for a child with a disability.  One commenter expressed concern that permitting school personnel to consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining a change in placement may result in schools applying this provision to cases for which it was not intended, potentially resulting in a denial of FAPE.  Other commenters requested clarifying that a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, and expression of remorse should be factors considered when making a case-by-case determination.  A few commenters requested school personnel document any supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the child's violation of a code of student behavior when making a case-by-case determination.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that the regulations do not need to be amended to clarify "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" because what constitutes "unique circumstances" is best determined at the local level by school personnel who know the individual child and all the facts and circumstances regarding a child's behavior.  We believe it would impede efforts of school personnel responsible for making a determination as to whether a change in placement for disciplinary purposes is appropriate for a child if the Department attempted to restrict or limit the interpretation of "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case-basis."  Factors such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the violation of a school code could be unique circumstances considered by school personnel when determining whether a disciplinary change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability.  We believe providing school personnel the flexibility to consider whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability on a case-by-case basis and to determine what unique circumstances should be considered regarding a child who violates a code of conduct, as provided for under section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, will limit the inappropriate removal of a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  We also decline the commenters' suggestion to regulate further about the case-by-case determination in light of the discretion granted under the Act to school personnel in making this determination.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that Sec. 300.530(a) could be used to justify ignoring a manifestation determination when determining whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child.  These commenters stated that the authority of school personnel to consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis could be used to usurp the authority of the group making the manifestation determination and the IEP Team.  Some commenters recommended removing the phrase "consistent with the requirements of this section" in Sec. 300.530(a) because it is not included in the Act and limits the individualized disciplinary options that might arise under this authority.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.530(a), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, clarifies that, on a case-by-case basis, school personnel may consider whether a change in placement, that is otherwise permitted under the disciplinary procedures, is appropriate and should occur.  It does not independently authorize school personnel, on a case-by-case basis, to institute a change in placement that would be inconsistent with Sec. 300.530(b) through (i), including the requirement in paragraph (e) of this section regarding manifestation determinations.  We are revising Sec. 300.530(a) to clarify that any consideration regarding a change in placement under paragraph (a) of this section must be consistent with all other requirements in Sec. 300.530.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(a), which follows the language in section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, appropriately gives school personnel the authority to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a change in placement that is consistent with the other requirements of Sec. 300.530, would be appropriate for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct and, therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to define a role for the IEP Team in this paragraph.

Discussion:  We are not removing "consecutive" from Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536, as recommended by the commenters, because the Department has long interpreted the Act to permit children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct to be removed from their current educational placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days at a time, and that additional removals of 10 consecutive school days or less in the same school year would be possible, as long as any removal does not constitute a change in placement.  We do not believe the changes to section 615(k) of the Act justify any change in this position.  Further, the Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 43, which states that "a school may order a change in placement for a child who violates a code of student conduct to an appropriate interim educational setting, another setting, or suspension, for 10 consecutive school days or less, to the same extent that it would apply such a discipline measure to a child without a disability."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended replacing "school days" with "calendar days" in Sec. 300.530 because using "school days" in the regulations might create a disincentive for school personnel to find solutions and develop an appropriate IEP in a timely manner.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act clearly states that school personnel may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from their current placement to an appropriate alternative education setting, other setting, or suspension, for not more than 10 "school days;" therefore, it would be inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act to change "school days" to "calendar days" as suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.530 and all sections that pertain to discipline stipulate that children with disabilities must not be disciplined more severely than non-disabled children and disciplinary measures applied to them must not be longer in duration than those applied to non-disabled students. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that it is necessary to change the regulations to state that children with disabilities must not be disciplined more severely than non-disabled children because Sec. 300.530(b)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act, is sufficiently clear that disciplinary measures are to be applied to children with disabilities to the extent they are applied to children without disabilities.  Further, the manifestation determination provision in paragraph (e) of this section, and the right of a parent to request an expedited due process hearing in Sec. 300.532, regarding the disciplinary placement or manifestation determination, are sufficient to ensure that schools implement disciplinary policies that provide for a uniform and fair way of disciplining children with disabilities in line with the discipline expectations for non-disabled students.  A primary intent of Congress in revising section 615(k) of the Act was to provide for a uniform and fair way of disciplining all children--both for those children with disabilities and those children without disabilities.

Comment:  A few commenters requested clarifying the Department's basis for the general authority of school personnel to remove a child with a disability for up to 10 consecutive school days, so as not to preclude subsequent short-term removals in the same school year.  Many commenters expressed concern that permitting subsequent removals of up to 10 consecutive school days in the same school year could be misapplied and result in a denial of services.  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.530 is not clear as to whether students who are removed for more than 10 school days in a school year must continue to receive services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Department has long interpreted the Act to permit schools to remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his or her current placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days, and that additional removals of 10 consecutive school days or less in the same school year would be possible, as long as those removals do not constitute a change in placement.  The requirements in Sec. 300.530(b) do not permit using repeated disciplinary removals of 10 school days or less as a means of avoiding the change in placement options in Sec. 300.536.  We believe it is important for purposes of school safety and order to preserve the authority that school personnel have to be able to remove a child for a discipline infraction for a short period of time, even though the child already may have been removed for more than 10 school days in that school year, as long as the pattern of removals does not itself constitute a change in placement of the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
On the other hand, discipline must not be used as a means of disconnecting a child with a disability from education.  Section 300.530(d) clarifies, in general, that the child must continue to receive educational services so that the child can continue to participate in the general curriculum (although in another setting), and progress toward meeting the goals in the child's IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended retaining the Department's long term policy that an in-school suspension would not be considered a part of the days of suspension as long as the child is afforded the opportunity to continue to appropriately progress in the general curriculum, continue to receive services specified on the child's IEP, and continue to participate with nondisabled children to the extent they would have in their current placement.  Other commenters recommended including in the regulations the commentary from the March 12, 1999 Federal Register (64 FR 12619) regarding whether an in-school suspension or a bus suspension constitutes a day of removal.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It has been the Department's long term policy that an in-school suspension would not be considered a part of the days of suspension addressed in Sec. 300.530 as long as the child is afforded the opportunity to continue to appropriately participate in the general curriculum, continue to receive the services specified on the child's IEP, and continue to participate with nondisabled children to the extent they would have in their current placement.  This continues to be our policy.  Portions of a school day that a child had been suspended may be considered as a removal in regard to determining whether there is a pattern of removals as defined in Sec. 300.536.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Because the determination as to whether an in-school suspension or bus suspension counts as a day of suspension under Sec. 300.530 depends on the unique circumstances of each case, we do not believe that we should include these policies in our regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the change from "continue to progress in the general curriculum" in current Sec. 300.522(b)(1) to "continue to participate in the general education curriculum" in Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) is a lower standard.  They requested that we use the language from current Sec. 300.522(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(d)(1) provide that a child must continue to receive educational services so as to enable the child "to continue to participate in the general educational curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP."  We believe that using the statutory language in the regulation is appropriate because the Act specifically uses different language to describe a child's relationship to the general education curriculum in periods of removal for disciplinary reasons than for services under the child's regular IEP in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act.  Based on this difference, we decline to make the change requested.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We caution that we do not interpret "participate" to mean that a school or district must replicate every aspect of the services that a child would receive if in his or her normal classroom.  For example, it would not generally be feasible for a child removed for disciplinary reasons to receive every aspect of the services that a child would receive if in his or her chemistry or auto mechanics classroom as these classes generally are taught using a hands-on component or specialized equipment or facilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended Sec. 300.530(d) clarify that children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct and are removed from their current placement to an interim alternative educational setting or another setting, or are suspended, are entitled to FAPE in accordance with section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Several commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) to explicitly state that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons must include all the special education services, related services, supplementary aids and services, and accommodations required by the child's IEP to ensure the child receives FAPE.  Many commenters requested that the regulations clarify that LEAs must continue to implement a child's IEP as written, including related services, while the child is in an interim alternative educational setting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.530(d) clarifies that decisions regarding the extent to which services would need to be provided and the amount of services that would be necessary to enable a child with a disability to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and progress toward achieving the goals on the child's IEP may be different if the child is removed from his or her regular placement for a short period of time.  For example, a child who is removed for a short period of time and who is performing at grade level may not need the same kind and amount of services to meet this standard as a child who is removed from his or her regular placement for 45 days under Sec. 300.530(g) or Sec. 300.532 and not performing at grade level.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe it is reasonable for school personnel (if the child is to be removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year and not considered a change in placement) and the IEP Team (if the child's removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536 and not a manifestation of the child's disability or a removal pursuant to Sec. 300.530(g)) to make informed educational decisions about the extent to which services must be provided for a child with a disability placed in an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension to enable the child to participate in the general education curriculum and make progress toward the goals of the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As stated above, we read the Act as modifying the concept of FAPE in circumstances where a child is removed from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons.  Specifically, we interpret section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to require that the special education and related services that are necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP, must be provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and, to the extent appropriate to the circumstances, be provided in conformity with the child's IEP.  We, therefore, believe Sec. 300.530(d)(1) should be amended to be consistent with the Act by adding the reference to the FAPE requirements in Sec. 300.101(a), and to ensure it is understood that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons are consistent with the FAPE requirements in section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are making additional technical changes to paragraph (d)(1) to eliminate cross-references, where appropriate, and to provide greater clarity that children with disabilities removed for disciplinary reasons pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section must continue to receive services and receive, as appropriate, a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention services and modifications.  We are, therefore, removing from paragraph (d)(1) of this section the phrase "except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4)" and removing the reference to paragraph (b) of this section, which references the general authority for removing a child who violates a code of student conduct, as it is unnecessary. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(3) is not clear and requested clarification as to whether children who are removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive services.

Other commenters requested clarifying the authority of school personnel with respect to the procedures in Sec. 300.530(d)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.  We also are amending paragraph (d)(3) of this section to write it in active voice and in the positive and removed the cross-reference to the general provision in paragraph (b) of this section, as it is not necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Technical changes have been made to Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to remove the cross-reference to paragraph (b) of this section.  We also amended this paragraph as stated above to provide greater clarity.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters wanted us to remove the words "if any" from Sec. 300.530(d)(4).  Several commenters thought that Sec. 300.530(d)(4), which allows school personnel to determine the extent to which services are needed, "if any," gives public agencies the authority to deny special education services to students who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year.  Other commenters also thought that including the phrase "if any" implies that special education services are not mandatory for a child who has been removed for 10 or more non-consecutive days and do not constitute a change in placement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.  The Act is clear that the public agency must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals in the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We recognize the concern of the commenters that the phrase "if any" could imply that school personnel need not provide educational services to these children.  Therefore, we are removing the phrase "if any" from paragraph (d)(4).  For clarity, we are replacing the cross-reference to Sec. 300.530(d)(1) with the language from Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) and restructure the paragraph.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter questioned whether the ability of school personnel to remove a child from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons means, if a child's current placement is a special education classroom setting, school personnel may remove the child from special education services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If the child's current placement is a special education setting, the child could be removed from the special education setting to another setting for disciplinary reasons.  Similarly, if the child with a disability who violated a school code of conduct receives services in a regular classroom, the child could be removed to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  Section 300.530(b), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act, provides that school personnel may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his or her current placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  However, Sec. 300.530(d) is clear that the child who is removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive educational services, to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in his or her IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.530(d)(4) to require that the parent be included in the consultation school personnel must have with at least one of the child's teachers to determine the extent to which services are needed for a child with a disability who has been removed from his or her current placement for more than 10 school days (if the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change in placement under Sec. 300.536). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.  However, there is nothing in these regulations that would prohibit school personnel, if they choose to do so, from including parents in the consultation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.530(d)(4) be modified to include the requirement in current Sec. 300.121(d)(3)(i) that school personnel consult with the child's special education teacher as opposed to any of the child's teachers.  The commenter stated that it makes sense that the special education teacher be considered the first choice for this role given that the special education teacher generally has the most knowledge of the child and the student's educational needs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The determination of which teacher school personnel should consult should be based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the needs of the child and the expertise of the child's teachers.  We agree that, in many cases, the special education teacher may be the most appropriate teacher with whom school personnel should consult.  This, however, is not always the case.  In light of the short-term nature of the removals under paragraph (d)(4) of the section and the need for school personnel to make quick decisions regarding services, we believe local school personnel need broad flexibility in making such decisions and are in the best position to determine the appropriate teacher with whom to consult.  For these reasons, we are not amending Sec. 300.530(d)(4) to require consultation with the child's special education teacher as in current Sec. 300.121(d)(3)(i).  There is nothing, however, in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit school personnel from consulting with one of the child's special education teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  It is not necessary to include the language recommended by the commenters as section 612(a)(16)(A) of the Act is clear that the State must ensure that all children with disabilities are included in all general State and districtwide assessment programs, including assessments described in section 1111 of the ESEA, 20 U.S.C. 6311, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments, if necessary, and as indicated in each child's respective IEP.

Comment:  One commenter requested specifying in Sec. 300.530(d) that LEAs must include children with disabilities placed in interim alternative educational settings in their determination of AYP.  The writer expressed concern that LEAs may try to avoid accountability by placing children with disabilities in interim alternative educational settings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not address the issue of AYP. However, title 1 of the ESEA is clear that children who are enrolled within a district for a full academic year must be included in the AYP reports of an LEA.  (20 U.S.C. 7325)  Title 1 of the ESEA does not provide an exception for children with disabilities placed in interim alternative educational settings.  In addition, State agencies, LEAs, and schools must assess all children, regardless of whether a child is to be included for reporting or accountability purposes and regardless of the amount of time the child has been enrolled in the State agency, LEA, or school.  The only public school children with disabilities enrolled in public settings who are exempted from participation in State and districtwide assessment programs under the Act are children with disabilities convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons (Sec. 300.324(d)(1)(i)).  As AYP is addressed under title 1 of the ESEA, we do not need to regulate on this matter. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, which requires that within 10 school days of any decision to change a child's placement because of a violation of a code of conduct, the LEA, parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall consider whether the conduct was caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the disability or whether the conduct was caused by the failure of the LEA to implement the IEP.  These commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) gives the IEP Team control over determinations regarding services and placement, regardless of manifestation, and does not give control to the LEA, parent and relevant members of the IEP Team as provided in the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the phrase "location in which services will be provided" as used in Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is not included in the Act.  The commenter pointed out that section 615(k)(2) of the Act refers to the IEP Team's "determination of setting."  The commenter stated that using the statutory language will make it less likely the IEP Team will interpret the regulations to require the IEP Team to determine the specific location of the services to be provided to a child removed from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting.  Several other commenters stated that the use of the phrase "location in which services will be provided" in paragraph (d)(5) of this section is confusing and recommended limiting the IEP Team responsibility to determining the setting (as required under section 615(k)(2) of the Act) and the services and not the specific location.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are persuaded by the commenters and, therefore, are removing the reference to "location in which services will be provided" in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.  We are also removing the phrase "is for more than 10 consecutive school days or" from paragraphs (d)(5) of this section because it is unnecessary since such a removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters requested including in Sec. 300.530(e) the following measures when determining the relationship between a behavior and a disability:  1) whether the child's disability impaired the ability of the child to control the behavior; 2) whether the child understood the impact and consequences of the behavior; 3) whether the placement was appropriate; or 4) whether the IEP, the identified services, and their implementation were appropriate.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter recommended clarifying that when a determination is made that a child's behavior is not a manifestation of his or her disability, if the group does not consider whether the IEP and placement were appropriate, the parents have the right to file a complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The language requested by the commenters was included in section 615(k)(4) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, P.L. 105-17.  Congress later removed the requirements mentioned by the commenters for conducting a review to determine whether a child's behavior was a manifestation of the child's disability and it would be beyond the authority of the Department to include the language in these regulations.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act now requires the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA), to determine whether a child's behavior was a manifestation of the child's disability based on two inquiries:  (1) was the conduct caused by, or did it have a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability; or (2) was the conduct the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP?  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
It is not necessary to clarify that a parent has the right to file a complaint, as the commenters suggest.  Section 300.532, consistent with section 615(k)(3) of the Act, provides that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), may request an expedited due process hearing, which must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed, and the determination by the hearing officer must be rendered within 10 school days after the hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the observations used for the manifestation determination review be from both teachers and related service personnel.  Some commenters requested Sec. 300.530(e) clarify that the phrase "all relevant information in the child's file" includes a review of the child's IEP, placement appropriateness, special education services, supplementary aids and services, and if the behavior intervention strategies were appropriate and consistent with the IEP.

Discussion:  Section 300.530(e)(1), which tracks section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, requires a review of all relevant information in the child's file, including the child's IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents.  We believe this clearly conveys that the list of relevant information in paragraph (e)(1) of the section is not exhaustive and may include other relevant information in the child's file, such as the information mentioned by the commenters.  It would be impractical to list all the possible relevant information that may be in a child's file and, therefore, it is not necessary to further regulate on this matter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  By including an introductory phrase to proposed Sec. 300.530(e)(1) we intended to clarify that a manifestation determination need not be conducted for removals that will be for not more than 10 consecutive school days and will not constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  In other words, manifestation determinations are limited to removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Upon further consideration, we believe the phrase "except for removals that will be for not more than 10 consecutive school days and will not constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536" is unnecessary and confusing.  We believe limiting Sec. 300.530(e)(1) to the statutory language in section 615(k)(1)(E)(i) of the Act makes it sufficiently clear that within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct a manifestation determination must be conducted and, therefore, we are removing the introductory phrase as it is unnecessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the manifestation determination is too narrow and does not account for the spectrum of inter-related and individual challenges associated with many disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the criteria in Sec. 300.530(e)(1) that the LEA, parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team must determine whether a child's conduct is a manifestation of the child's disability is broad and flexible, and would include such factors as the inter-related and individual challenges associated with many disabilities.  The revised manifestation provisions in section 615 of the Act provide a simplified, common sense manifestation determination process that could be used by school personnel.  The basis for this change is provided in note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., pp. 224-225, which states, "the Conferees intend to assure that the manifestation determination is done carefully and thoroughly with consideration of any rare or extraordinary circumstances presented."  The Conferees further intended that "if a change in placement is proposed, the manifestation determination will analyze the child's behavior as demonstrated across settings and across time when determining whether the conduct in question is a direct result of the disability."

Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the manifestation determination in Sec. 300.530(e) include a case-by-case analysis of the disability of the child involved compared with the child's conduct as many children with disabilities display behaviors that can be disruptive to a classroom, but these behaviors should not be considered a current disciplinary issue when the behaviors are characteristic of the disability. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that it is not necessary to modify the regulations to include a requirement that a manifestation determination include a case-by-case analysis of the disability of the child because section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(e) are sufficiently clear that decisions regarding the manifestation determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.  We believe the Act recognizes that a child with a disability may display disruptive behaviors characteristic of the child's disability and the child should not be punished for behaviors that are a result of the child's disability.  The intent of Congress in developing section 615(k)(1)(E) was that, in determining that a child's conduct was a manifestation of his or her disability, it must be determined that "the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, and was not an attenuated association, such as low self-esteem, to the child's disability."  (Note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 225).  The regulation, which follows the statutory language, thus accurately reflects the manner in which the Act describes the behavior of the child is to be considered in the manifestation determination.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Further, section 615(k)(1)(F) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(f) provide that if the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team make the determination that the behavior resulting in the removal was a manifestation of the child's disability, the following actions must be implemented:  (1) the IEP Team must conduct a functional behavioral assessment, unless the LEA had conducted a functional behavioral assessment before the behavior that resulted in the change in placement occurred, and implement a behavioral intervention plan for the child; (2) or if a behavioral intervention plan already has been developed, review the behavioral intervention plan, and modify it, as necessary, to address the behavior; and (3) return the child to the placement from which the child was removed (other than a 45 day placement under Sec. 300.530(g)), unless the parent and the LEA agree to a change in placement as part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  The Act no longer requires that the appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement be considered when making a manifestation determination.  The Act now requires that the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team must, when making a manifestation determination, determine whether (1) the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability; or (2) the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  However, Sec. 300.532, consistent with section 615(k)(3) of the Act, does provide that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), may request an expedited due process hearing, which must occur within 20 school days of the date the hearing is requested and must result in a determination within 10 school days after the hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  Under section 615(k)(1)(F) of the Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, if the behavior that resulted in the change of placement is determined to be a manifestation of a child's disability, the child must be returned to the placement from which the child was removed (other than a 45 day placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530(g), 300.532(b)(2), and 300.533), unless the public agency and the parents otherwise agree to a change of placement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
When the behavior is related to the child's disability, proper development of the child's IEP should include development of strategies, including positive behavioral interventions, supports, and other strategies to address that behavior, consistent with Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i).  When the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of a child's disability but has not previously been addressed in the child's IEP, the IEP Team must review and revise the child's IEP so that the child will receive services appropriate to his or her needs.  Implementation of the behavioral strategies identified in a child's IEP, including strategies designed to correct behavior by imposing disciplinary consequences, is appropriate under the Act and section 504, even if the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.  A change in placement that is appropriate and consistent with the child's needs may be implemented subject to the parent's procedural safeguards regarding prior notice (Sec. 300.503), mediation (Sec. 300.506), due process (Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517) and pendency (Sec. 300.518).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  If the LEA, the parent, and the relevant members of the IEP Team determine that the child's conduct is a manifestation of the child's disability because the child's behavior was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP, the LEA has an affirmative obligation to take immediate steps to ensure that all services set forth in the child's IEP are provided, consistent with the child's needs as identified in the IEP.  We agree with the commenters that these regulations should require that, if it is determined that the child's behavior was a direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP, the LEA must take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (e)(3) to this section, consistent with this obligation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that the absence of short-term objectives in the IEP will hinder the ability of the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team to determine whether a child's conduct is the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP.  The group members making the manifestation determination are required to review not only the IEP of the child, but all relevant information in the child's folder, any teacher observations of the child, and any relevant information provided by the parents.  We believe the information available to the group making the manifestation determination, when reviewed in its totality, is sufficient to make a manifestation determination.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring that, even if a child's conduct is determined not to be a manifestation of the child's disability pursuant to Sec. 300.530(e), the IEP Team, in determining how the child will be provided services, must, at a minimum, consider whether to conduct a functional behavioral assessment and implement a behavior plan.  One commenter requested that the requirement in Sec. 300.530(f) for conducting a functional behavioral assessment be removed from this section and added to Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324, regarding IEPs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.530(f), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(F) of the Act, requires that a child with a disability receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment, and behavioral intervention plan and modifications, that are designed to address the child's behavior if the child's behavior that gave rise to the removal is a manifestation of the child's disability.  As provided in Sec. 300.530(e), a manifestation determination is only required for disciplinary removals that constitute a change of placement under Sec. 300.536.  However, we must recognize that Congress specifically removed from the Act a requirement to conduct a functional behavioral assessment or review and modify an existing behavioral intervention plan for all children within 10 days of a disciplinary removal, regardless of whether the behavior was a manifestation or not. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We also recognize, though, that as a matter of practice, it makes a great deal of sense to attend to behavior of children with disabilities that is interfering with their education or that of others, so that the behavior can be addressed, even when that behavior will not result in a change in placement.  In fact, the Act emphasizes a proactive approach to behaviors that interfere with learning by requiring that, for children with disabilities whose behavior impedes their learning or that of others, the IEP Team consider, as appropriate, and address in the child's IEP, "the use of positive behavioral interventions, and other strategies to address the behavior."  (See section 614(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act).  This provision should ensure that children who need behavior intervention plans to succeed in school receive them.  For these reasons, we decline to make the changes suggested. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested requiring that a functional behavioral assessment older than one year be considered invalid in a manifestation determination review.

Discussion:  We believe it would be inappropriate to specify through regulation what constitutes a "current" or "valid" functional behavioral assessment as such decisions are best left to the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the LEA and the parent) who, pursuant to section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, are responsible for making the manifestation determination.  As a policy matter, a previously conducted functional behavioral assessment that is valid and relevant should be included in the information reviewed by the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team when making a manifestation determination. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring that an appropriate permanent placement be in effect at the beginning of the next school year to ensure that a child is not held in the 45-school day interim alternative educational setting for a period that extends into the new academic year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Interim alternative educational settings under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(g) are limited to not more than 45 school days, unless extended by the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532(b)(3) because returning the child to his or her original placement would be substantially likely to cause injury to him or herself or to others.  The 45-school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting, unless extended by Sec. 300.532(b)(3), is a maximum time limit for a change in placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  We decline to change the regulations as suggested by the commenters based on the school year ending before a child completes the ordered school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting (in this example 45 school days).  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that precludes the public agency from requiring the child to fulfill the remainder of the placement when a new school year begins as agency personnel have this flexibility under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters requested that the regulations clarify that a child's home is not a suitable placement setting for an interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability removed pursuant to Sec. 300.530 for disciplinary reasons.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While the Act does not specify the alternative setting in which educational services must be provided, the Act is clear that the determination of an appropriate alternative educational setting must be selected "so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP."  (See section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act).  Further, section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the interim alternative educational setting must be determined by the IEP Team.  What constitutes an appropriate interim alternative educational setting will depend on the circumstances of each individual case.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Whether a child's home would be an appropriate interim alternative educational setting under Sec. 300.530 would depend on the particular circumstances of an individual case such as the length of the removal, the extent to which the child previously has been removed from his or her regular placement, and the child's individual needs and educational goals.  In general, though, because removals under Sec. Sec. 300.530(g) and 300.532 will be for periods of time up to 45 days, care must be taken to ensure that if home instruction is provided for a child removed under Sec. 300.530, the services that are provided will satisfy the requirements for services for a removal under Sec. 300.530(d) and section 615(k)(1)(D) of the Act.  We do not believe, however, that it is appropriate to include in the regulations that a child's home is not a suitable placement setting for an interim alternative educational setting as suggested by the commenter.  As stated above, the Act gives the IEP Team the responsibility of determining the alternative setting and we believe the IEP Team must have the flexibility to make the setting determination based on the circumstances and the child's individual needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the high standard of "serious bodily injury" is unreasonable.  The commenter states that school personnel should be given discretion to remove children for a 45 school-day period who have committed assault or otherwise acted dangerously.  The commenter stated that the standard for having inflicted "serious bodily injury" would seldom be met without a child being incarcerated.  Another commenter stated that the statutory definition of serious bodily injury is too narrow to have much practical value for school purposes since most injuries on school grounds are not related to the use of dangerous weapons.  This commenter recommended expanding the definition to include more typical injuries that occur on school property, and not limiting the definition by the language in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.530(g)(3) incorporates the new provision in section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act that permits school personnel to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days without regard to whether the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability if the child has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school, on school premises, or at a school function.  Section 615(k)(7)(D) of the Act is clear that the term serious bodily injury has the meaning given the term in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  That provision defines serious bodily injury as bodily injury, which involves substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Nothing in the Act permits the Department to expand the definition of serious bodily injury, as used in Sec. 300.530(g), to include a bodily injury beyond that included in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h).

Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying the distinction between the removal of a child to an interim alternative educational setting by school personnel for inflicting "serious bodily injury upon another person" (Sec. 300.530(g)(3)) and the removal of the child by a hearing officer because maintaining the child's current placement is "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" (Sec. 300.532(b)(2)(ii)).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended clarifying that parental notification in Sec. 300.530(h) must take place following disciplinary action proposing a removal of a child for more than 10 consecutive days or when there is a disciplinary change in placement.  One commenter suggested that, to be consistent with the Act, the parental notification requirement should only pertain to disciplinary decisions made pursuant to Sec. 300.530(g).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.  We believe that, on the one hand, it would be unreasonably burdensome to read the term as applying to every imposition of discipline, including those that might not result in the child being removed from the regular educational environment at all.  On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.  Therefore, we agree with those commenters who suggested that paragraph (h) of this section should be amended to clarify that the requirement for parental notification applies to a removal that constitutes a change in placement of a child with a disability for a violation of a code of student conduct.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.530(h) has been amended to clarify that on the date on which the decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change in the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA must notify the parents of that decision, and provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirement in Sec. 300.530(h), which requires the LEA to provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504 whenever the decision to take disciplinary action is made, is inconsistent with the Act and recommended revising Sec. 300.530(h) to be consistent with section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act.  The commenter stated that section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act requires the LEA to "notify" the parents of the decision to take disciplinary action and of all the procedural safeguards.  The commenter stated that the statutory language implies that the LEA simply needs to remind (notify) the parent of the procedural safeguards given to them for the school year as required in section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) through (iii) of the Act, not to "provide" the parents with the procedural safeguards notice as required in Sec. 300.530(h).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter is correct that section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act does not specifically state that the LEA must "provide a copy" of the procedural safeguards notice but, that the LEA must "notify" the parent of the LEA's decision to take disciplinary action and of all procedural safeguards accorded under section 615 of the Act.  We believe, however, that implicit in the Act is a much higher standard for "notify" than "remind" parents as suggested by the commenter.  Further, in other places where "notify" is used in the Act, it is clear the meaning of the term is "to provide notice " (for example, section 615(c)(2)(A) and (D) of the Act).  We believe Sec. 300.530(h), which requires the LEA to notify the parents of its decision to change the placement of their child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct and provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504, is reasonable and consistent with the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes discussion for subpart A of this part, including the actual definitions of terms that are defined in statutes other than the Act is problematic because these definitions may change over time and the Department would need to amend the regulations each time an included definition that is defined in another statute changes.

Comment:  Numerous commenters requested clarifying in the regulations that the public agency has the burden to prove to a hearing officer that removing the child is necessary because maintaining the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to self or others.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer, the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the LEA.  Where the public agency has requested that a hearing officer remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting, the burden of persuasion is on the public agency.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters requested that the regulations clarify that the LEA has the burden of proof in determining whether the child's behavior was or was not a manifestation of the child's disability and that the IEP was appropriate and properly implemented.  Other commenters expressed concern that the regulations, as written, put the burden on the parent to prove either that the conduct was caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability or that the IEP was not being implemented.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The concept of burden of proof is not applicable to the manifestation determination, which does not occur in a hearing under the Act.  Under Sec. 300.530(e), the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) are responsible for determining whether the child's behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability, by conducting a fair inquiry into the issues posed by Sec. 300.530(e)(1)(i) and (ii).  If the parent disagrees with the manifestation determination, they have the right to appeal that decision by requesting a due process hearing under Sec. 300.532.  At the point a due process hearing is requested, the concept of burden of proof would be applicable.  As stated above, the Supreme Court determined in Schaffer that the burden of proof ultimately is allocated to the moving party.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended requiring that the hearing officer must consider the appropriateness of the child's current placement; consider whether the public agency has made reasonable efforts to minimize the risk of harm in the child's current placement, including the use of supplementary aids and services; and determine that the interim alternative educational setting meets specified requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not making changes to the regulations, regarding a hearing officer's decision-making, to require a hearing officer to consider such factors as those suggested by the commenters because a hearing officer must have the ability to conduct hearings and render and write decisions in accordance with appropriate, standard legal practice and exercise his or her judgment in the context of all the factors involved in an individual case.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Some commenters recommended clarifying the reference to a "hearing" in Sec. 300.532(a) and an "expedited hearing" in Sec. 300.532(c).  Some of these commenters stated that there seems to be a conflict between the two hearings.  Other commenters questioned whether the hearing referenced in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section must be conducted consistent with all the impartial due process hearing requirements.  Another commenter suggested that a hearing requested pursuant to Sec. 300.532 may be contrary to section 615(h) of the Act, which provides for the right to counsel, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence and receive the record of due process hearings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The hearing referenced in Sec. 300.532(a) and (c) is the same hearing and not separate hearings.  Paragraph (a) in this section states that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding a placement, or the manifestation determination, or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request a hearing.  Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  We believe these regulations will ensure that the basic protections regarding hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States to adjust other procedural rules they may have superimposed on due process hearings in light of the expedited nature of these hearings.  Further, we believe it is important that all the due process protections in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are maintained because of the importance of the rights at issue in these hearings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

The commenter suggested that Sec. 300.532(b)(3), which permits the LEA to return to the hearing officer to request continuation of an interim alternative education placement if the LEA believes the child would be dangerous if returned to the original placement, is a lesser standard than that required of the hearing officer in Sec. 300.532(b)(2)(ii), which permits a hearing officer to order a change in placement to an appropriate interim alternative education setting if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is no intended difference between the phrase "likely to result in injury to the child or others" as used in Sec. 300.532(b)(2)(ii) and "child would be dangerous" as used in Sec. 300.532(b)(3).  Section 300.532(b)(2)(ii) clarifies that the hearing officer can order a change in placement of a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  To avoid confusion, the term "dangerous" is replaced with "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters questioned whether the change from the heading "expedited due process hearings" in current Sec. 300.528 to "expedited hearing" in Sec. 300.532(c) represents a change in the hearings that are available under Sec. 300.532.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The removal of "due process" from the heading in current 300.528 does not represent a substantive change.  The change was made to track the statutory requirements in the Act.  However, we believe it is important to clarify that an expedited hearing under Sec. 300.532(c) is a due process hearing and the heading to paragraph (c) has been amended to retain the heading in current Sec. 300.528.  We also have made additional technical and clarifying changes to paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of Sec. 300.532.  In paragraph (c)(2) of this section, we are clarifying that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and restructuring the paragraph for clarity.  In paragraph (c)(3) of this section, we are clarifying that the meeting referenced in this paragraph is a resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  The heading in Sec. 300.532(c) has been revised to clarify that a hearing under paragraph (c) of this section is an "expedited due process hearing."

Comment:  Many commenters requested clarifying whether the requirements in Sec. 300.508(d), regarding sufficiency of the complaint, apply to the expedited hearing requested under Sec. 300.532(c), pertaining to disagreements with a decision regarding disciplinary placements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In light of the shortened timelines for conducting an expedited due process hearing under Sec. 300.532(c), it is not practical to apply to the expedited due process hearing the sufficiency provision in Sec. 300.508(d), which requires that the due process complaint must be deemed sufficient unless the party receiving the due process complaint notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the due process complaint, that the receiving party believes the due process complaint does not include all the necessary content of a complaint as required in Sec. 300.508(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
To identify the provisions that do apply when a parent requests a hearing under Sec. 300.532(a), we have changed Sec. 300.532(a) to clarify that parents and the LEA may request a hearing under Sec. 300.532(a) by filing a complaint pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.507 and 300.508(a) and (b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed Sec. 300.532(a) to provide that the parent and the LEA may request a hearing under this section by filing a complaint pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.507 and 300.508(a) and (b). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that section 615(k) of the Act does not require a resolution meeting as part of an expedited hearing and recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(i) that a resolution meeting must occur within seven days of the date an expedited hearing is requested under Sec. 300.532(a).  One commenter stated that, given the expedited timelines for the hearing and the decision, Congress did not intend for the resolution meeting to apply to an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(4) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.  However, the parties may agree to waive the resolution meeting or agree to use the mediation process.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters noted that Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(i) states that a resolution meeting must occur within seven days of the date the "hearing is requested," while Sec. 300.510(a)(1), consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(i)(I) of the Act, states that the resolution meeting must occur within 15 days of "receiving notice of the due process complaint."  The commenters recommended that the Department amend Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(i) to be consistent with Sec. 300.510(a)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the language in Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(i) should be consistent with Sec. 300.510(a)(1) and are amending Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(i) to state that a resolution meeting must occur within seven days of "receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint" to be consistent with Sec. 300.510(a)(1).  In addition, for consistency, we are amending Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(ii) to state that the due process hearing may proceed unless the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties within 15 days of "the receipt of the parent's due process complaint."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of Sec. 300.532 have been amended as stated above.  Paragraph (c)(3) of this section has also been amended to remove the cross-reference to Sec. 300.510(a)(3) and specific explanatory language has been inserted.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether the intent of Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(ii) is to allow the expedited hearing to go forward if the parent fails to participate in the resolution meeting within 15 days of receipt of a hearing request or whether the resolution meeting and hearing would be indefinitely delayed in the context of the expedited hearing for the failure of a parent to participate in the resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.532(c)(3)(i) clearly states that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of a public agency's receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint.  It is not expected that parties will necessarily reach agreement during the resolution meeting; the parties often need time to consider the resolution options offered at the meeting.  The intent of Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(ii) is to allow parties sufficient time to consider the resolution options discussed in the resolution meeting.  However, if the parties do not reach agreement within 15 days of receipt of the parent's due process complaint, the expedited hearing may proceed and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) commence.  Lack of parent participation in the resolution meeting would be addressed the same way it is in a regular due process hearing under Sec. 300.510(b), except that the timeframes will differ.  For these reasons, we believe it is unnecessary to clarify the regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), which allows a State to shorten the time periods for the disclosure of evidence, evaluations, and recommendations for expedited due process hearings to two business days, because it will not give a parent adequate time to prepare for hearings, especially when a parent doesn't have a lawyer.  One commenter stated that because LEAs have possession and control of education records, a reduction to two days for disclosure is unfair and creates a hardship on a parent in preparing for the hearing.  Other commenters stated that this provision is inconsistent with section 615(f)(2) of the Act, which requires that not less than five business days prior to a hearing, parties must disclose all evaluations and recommendations that parties intend to use at a hearing.  A few commenters stated that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4) diminishes the protections for children with disabilities and their parents found in the July 20, 1983 regulations, and, therefore, violates section 607(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are persuaded by the commenters that limiting the disclosure time to two days would significantly impair the ability of the parties to prepare for the hearing, since one purpose of the expedited hearing is to provide protection to the child.  We are removing proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), which provides an exception to the normal five day disclosure requirement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4) for the reason stated above.  In addition, proposed paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section have been redesignated as paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5), respectively.  A technical edit has been made to paragraph (c)(1) of this section to ensure the reference to proposed paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section now reference paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) consistent with these changes.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(5) (new Sec. 300.532(c)(4)), which permits States to establish a different set of procedural rules for expedited due process hearings, could permit States to re-write rules regarding basic procedural safeguards.  One commenter expressed concern that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(5) may lead to abuse if the rules from Sec. Sec. 300.511 through 300.514 regarding complaints, sufficiency, raising new issues, losing on procedural grounds, and appeals are not part of the expedited due process hearing requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(5), as written, could be interpreted to give States authority to change due process rules provided for in the Act.  Therefore, we are amending new Sec. 300.532(c)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(5)) to clarify that while a State may establish different State-imposed procedural rules for expedited due process hearings conducted under this section than it has established for other due process hearings, the State must ensure that the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  This will ensure that the basic protections regarding expedited hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States, in light of the expedited nature of these hearings, to adjust other procedural rules they have established for due process hearings.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended retaining the "stay-put" requirement in current Sec. 300.526(b).  This section provides that if a child is placed in an interim alternative education setting and school personnel propose to change the child's placement after expiration of the interim alternative educational placement, during the pendency of any proceeding to challenge the proposed change in placement, the child must remain in the child's placement prior to the interim alternative educational setting.  One commenter requested clarification as to whether the removal of current Sec. 300.526(b) represents a substantive change in the Department's policy.  Other commenters requested clarifying what the child's placement would be after the 45-day interim alternative educational setting if the LEA requests another hearing under Sec. 300.532(b)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act changed the stay-put provision applying to disciplinary actions.  The provisions regarding stay-put in current Sec. 300.527(b) are not included in these regulations because the provisions upon which Sec. 300.527(b) were based, were removed by Congress from section 615(k)(4) of the Act.  We, therefore, are not revising the regulations in light of Congress' clear intent that, when there is an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the public agency, the child shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team pending the hearing officer's decision or until the time period for the disciplinary action expires, which ever occurs first, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.533 reflects the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act.  For example, consistent with Sec. 300.533, if a child's parents oppose a proposed change in placement at the end of a 45-day interim alternative educational placement, during the pendency of the proceeding to challenge the change in placement, the child remains in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action, whichever occurs first, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that LEAs and SEAs not be allowed to have a policy prohibiting the IEP Team from deciding where the child would "stay-put" during an appeal under Sec. 300.532.  The commenter stated that the IEP Team should have the authority to maintain a child in his or her current placement when appropriate.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.531, consistent with section 615(k)(2) of the Act, provides that the IEP Team determines the interim alternative educational setting for removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Additionally, section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act is clear that, during an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act, the child must remain in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action expires, whichever comes first, unless the parent and the LEA agree otherwise.  Thus, under the Act, whenever a hearing is requested under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the LEA, it is the parties involved in the hearing (i.e., the parent and the LEA), not the IEP Team, that may agree to change the time period of the removal or the interim setting for the child.  We, therefore, do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenter.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations, however, which would prohibit the parents and the LEA from agreeing to involve the IEP Team in any decision to change the time period of the removal or interim alternative educational setting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters requested including in Sec. 300.534(b)(1) language allowing the parent of the child to express concerns about his or her child orally to supervisory or administrative personnel, rather than requiring written notification.  Other commenters requested clarifying what it means for parents to "express concern" to school personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(5)(B)(i) of the Act clearly states that parents must express concern "in writing" to supervisory or administrative personnel, or a teacher of the child, that their child is in need of special education and related services.  To include the language recommended by the commenters in Sec. 300.534(b)(1) to allow the parent of the child to orally express their concerns (as opposed to doing so in writing) is inconsistent with and would impermissibly broaden the requirements in the Act.  We do not believe it is necessary to clarify the phrase "express concern" in Sec. 300.534(b) because we believe that, in the context of this section, it is understood to mean that a parent is concerned that his or her child is in need of special education and related services and expresses that concern in writing to the child's teacher or administrative personnel.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter recommended adding to the basis of knowledge criteria in Sec. 300.534(b) that if the child were currently receiving early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 the LEA would be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  A public agency will not be considered to have a basis of knowledge under Sec. 300.534(b) merely because a child receives services under the coordinated, early intervening services in section 613(f) of the Act and Sec. 300.226 of these regulations.  The basis of knowledge criteria is clearly stated in section 615(k)(5)(B) of the Act and Sec. 300.534.  We do not believe that expanding the basis of knowledge provision, as recommended by the commenter, would be appropriate given the specific requirements in the Act.  However, if a parent or a teacher of a child receiving early intervening services expresses a concern, in writing, to appropriate agency personnel, that the child may need special education and related services, the public agency would be deemed to have knowledge that the child is a child with a disability under this part. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.534(b)(3) that the teacher of the child must express specific concerns regarding a child's pattern of behavior directly to the director of special education of the LEA or to other supervisory personnel of the LEA "in accordance with the agency's established child find or special education referral system."  One of the commenters stated that this language is confusing and is not required by the Act.  One commenter requested clarifying whether the LEA would be deemed to have knowledge if the information was relayed by a child's teacher in a written manner not consistent with the LEA's referral system.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Since not all child find and referral processes in States and LEAs would necessarily meet the requirement in section 615(k)(5)(B)(iii) of the Act that the teacher of the child, or other personnel of the LEA, must express specific concerns about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child "directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency," we are removing from Sec. 300.534(b)(3) the requirement that concerns be expressed in accordance with the agency's established child find or special education referral system.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We continue to believe the child find and special education referral system is an important function of schools, LEAs, and States.  School personnel should refer children for evaluation through the agency's child or special education referral system when the child's behavior or performance indicates that they may have a disability covered under the Act.  Having the teacher of a child (or other personnel) express his or her concerns regarding a child in accordance with the agency's established child find or referral system helps ensure that the concerns expressed are specific, rather than casual comments, regarding the behaviors demonstrated by the child and indicate that the child may be a child with a disability under the Act.  For these reasons, we would encourage those States and LEAs whose child find or referral processes do not permit teachers to express specific concerns directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency, to change these processes to meet this requirement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  In light of some State child find procedures, we have removed from Sec. 300.534(b)(3) the requirement that the teacher or other LEA personnel must express concerns regarding a child's pattern of behavior in accordance with the agency's established child find or special education referral system. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended clarifying that a child who was evaluated and determined ineligible for special education and related services years ago would not be an exception under Sec. 300.534(c) to the basis of knowledge requirement in paragraph (b) of this section.  Many commenters recommended that an evaluation and eligibility determination that is more than three years old not prevent deeming an LEA to have a basis of knowledge.  One of these commenters specifically recommended revising Sec. 300.534(c)(1)(i) to clarify that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311 "within three years prior to the incident."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.  The intent of Congress in revising section 615(k)(5) of the Act was to "ensure that schools can appropriately discipline students, while maintaining protections for students whom the school had valid reason to know had a disability" and that the provisions in the Act should not have the "unintended consequence of providing a shield against the ability of a school district to be able to appropriately discipline a student."  (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 46).  We are not including time restrictions, as suggested by the commenters, to the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section because we believe such restrictions are unnecessary and could have the unintended consequence of hindering the school's ability to appropriately discipline a child.  We believe the basis of knowledge provision in Sec. 300.534(b) is sufficient to ensure that a school had valid reason to know that a child may need special education and related services.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended removing Sec. 300.534(c)(1)(i), which states that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311.  The commenters stated that this would deny children with disabilities FAPE and the procedural protections granted children with disabilities removed from their educational placement for disciplinary reasons. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirement in Sec. 300.534(c)(1)(i), regarding the exception to the basis of knowledge if a parent refuses to consent to an evaluation, is statutory.  Further, Sec. 300.300(a)(3), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(I) of the Act, clearly states that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue an initial evaluation of a child if the parents refuse to provide consent, or fail to respond to a request to provide consent, for the initial evaluation, by utilizing the Act's due process procedures.  If a public agency chooses not to utilize the Act's due process procedures, the LEA is not considered in violation of the requirement to provide FAPE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended retaining in Sec. 300.534(c)(2) the language in current Sec. 300.527(c)(1)(i) to clarify that the evaluation used to determine whether a child is a child with a disability under this part must be conducted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is accurate that the evaluation referenced in Sec. 300.534(c)(2) must be conducted consistent with the evaluation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311.  We agree with the commenters that paragraph (c)(2) of this section should be amended to make clear that the evaluation conducted under this paragraph must be conducted consistent with the evaluation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters recommended amending Sec. 300.534(d)(2) to require that if a request is made for an evaluation of a child during the time period in which the child is subjected to a disciplinary removal under Sec. 300.530, the evaluation must be completed within ten days of the parent's request and that an eligibility determination be made within five days of the completion of the evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe a specific timeline for an expedited evaluation or an eligibility determination should be included in these regulations.  What may be required to conduct an evaluation will vary widely depending on the nature and extent of a child's suspected disability and the amount of additional information that would be necessary to make an eligibility determination.  However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.  (See section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act).  Further, we believe it would be inappropriate to specify the timeframe from the completion of an evaluation to the determination of eligibility when there is no specific statutory basis to do so.  The Department has long held that eligibility decisions should be made within a reasonable period of time following the completion of an evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.534(d)(2) seems to imply that when a request is made for an expedited evaluation of a child subjected to a disciplinary removal, the child would receive an educational placement and services pending the results of the evaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.534(d) is clear.  Section 300.534(d) does not require the provision of services to a child while an expedited evaluation is being conducted, if the public agency did not have a basis of knowledge that the child was a child with a disability.  An educational placement under Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(ii) may include a suspension or expulsion without services, if those measures are comparable to disciplinary measures applied to children without disabilities who engage in comparable behavior.  Of course, States and LEAs are free to choose to provide services to children under Sec. 300.534(d).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirement in Sec. 300.535(b)(2), which requires a public agency reporting a crime to transmit copies of the child's special education and disciplinary records only to the extent that the transmission is permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), is beyond the scope of the Act and should be removed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that Sec. 300.535(b)(2) goes beyond the scope of the Act as sections 612(a)(8) and 617(c) of the Act direct the Secretary to take appropriate action, in accordance with FERPA, to assure the confidentiality of personally identifiable information contained in records collected or maintained by the Secretary and by SEAs and LEAs.  We therefore are not removing this provision.  We maintain that the provisions in section 615(k)(6)(B) of the Act, as reflected in Sec. 300.535(b)(2), must be read consistent with the disclosures permitted under FERPA for the education records of all children.  Under FERPA, personally identifiable information (such as the child's status as a special education child) can only be released with parental consent, except in certain very limited circumstances.  Therefore, the transmission of a child's special education and disciplinary records under paragraph (b)(2) of this section without parental consent is permissible only to the extent that such transmission is permitted under FERPA.

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the requirements in Sec. 300.536 do not account for schools with zero tolerance policies.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 do account for zero tolerance policies by providing public agencies the flexibility to implement discipline policies as they deem necessary to create safe classrooms and schools for teachers and children as long as those policies are fair and equitable for all children and protect the rights of children with disabilities.  If a child with a disability is removed from his or her current placement and placed in an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspended or expelled under the public agency's zero tolerance policy, the disciplinary requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 apply.  Therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to include language in Sec. 300.536 regarding a public agency's zero tolerance policy as such policies are irrelevant to what constitutes a change in placement for disciplinary removals under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  We believe section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act regarding the authority of school personnel to remove children with disabilities for not more than 10 school days, to the same extent as nondisabled children, provides the statutory basis for proposed Sec. 300.536(b) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)).  This section of the Act does not permit using repeated disciplinary removals of 10 school days or less as a means of avoiding the normal change in placement protections under Part B of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended removing the reference to manifestation determination in proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii)).  Several of these commenters stated that it is unnecessary since the manifestation determination is reserved for removals longer than 10 school days.  Some commenters stated if the language in proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that a series of removals constitutes a pattern because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year is going to be retained, proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) should be eliminated because it is excessive and has no basis in the Act.  Other commenters found the manifestation determination requirement in proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section "circular" because requiring a child's behavior to be a manifestation of his or her disability before determining that a change in placement has occurred under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) and then requiring that a manifestation determination be conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), whenever a child's removal constitutes a change in placement, is redundant and confusing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that requiring that a child's behavior must be a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under proposed paragraph (b) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) should be removed.  We believe it is sufficient for the public agency to conclude that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of removals that total more than 10 school days in a school year, the behaviors are substantially similar in nature, and such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another support the premise that the series of removals constitute a pattern.  However, our removal of the manifestation determination under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) does not eliminate the obligation to conduct a manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e) if the public agency's determination is that the series of removals constitutes a change in placement.  Section 300.530(e) requires that a manifestation determination be conducted within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have restructured proposed Sec. 300.536(b) as follows:  Proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section is redesignated as new paragraph (a)(2)(i); proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section is redesignated as new paragraph (a)(2)(ii); proposed paragraph (b)(3) of this section is redesignated as paragraph (a)(2)(iii).  We also removed from new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section (proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section) the requirement that a child's behavior must have been a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended revising proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii)) to clarify that the child's behavior must be substantially similar to the child's behavior in "previous" incidents that resulted in the series of removals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Our intent in including new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2)) to these regulations is to assist in the appropriate application of the change in placement provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  We concur with the commenter and believe adding the reference to "previous" incidents provides clarity to the provision that, when determining whether a child has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern under Sec. 300.536(a)(2), school personnel should determine whether the child's behavior that resulted in the removal is substantially similar to the previous incidents that resulted in the series of removals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  New Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2)) has been amended to reference the child's behavior in "previous" incidents that resulted in the series of removals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters requested the regulations define "substantially similar behavior."  Many commenters expressed concern that there is no precedent or statutory support for the use of "substantially similar behavior" and requested explaining the statutory basis for including the provision.  One commenter suggested including a provision in proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) that substantially similar behaviors must have been recognized by the IEP Team or be included in the IEP as related to the child's disability.  One commenter stated that what constitutes "substantially similar behavior" is highly subjective, prone to overuse, and likely to lead to litigation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations because, in light of the Department's longstanding position that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of disciplinary removals that constitute a pattern, we believe requiring the public agency to carefully review the child's previous behaviors to determine whether the behaviors, taken cumulatively, are substantially similar is an important step in determining whether a series of removals of a child constitutes a change in placement, and is necessary to ensure that public agencies appropriately apply the change in placement provisions.  Whether the behavior in the incidents that resulted in the series of removals is "substantially similar" should be made on a case-by-case basis and include consideration of any relevant information regarding the child's behaviors, including, where appropriate, any information in the child's IEP.  However, we do not believe it is appropriate to require in these regulations that the "substantially similar behaviors" be recognized by the IEP Team or included in the child's IEP as recommended by the commenter.  The commenter is correct that what constitutes "substantially similar behavior" is a subjective determination.  However, we believe that when the child's behaviors, taken cumulatively, are objectively reviewed in the context of all the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for determining whether the series of behaviors constitutes a change in placement, the public agency will be able to make a reasonable determination as to whether a change in placement has occurred.  Of course, if the parent disagrees with the determination by the public agency, the parent may request a due process hearing pursuant to Sec. 300.532.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
