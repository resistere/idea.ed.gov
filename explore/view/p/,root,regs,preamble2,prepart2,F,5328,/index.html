Timeframe for Public Reporting About LEA Performance Public Reporting 
and Privacy (Sec.  300.602(b))
<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(originally published on December 1, 2008 &#8211; 73 FR 73006; effective date &#8211; December 31, 2008)
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Several commenters requested that we change the public 
reporting timeline in proposed Sec.  300.602(b)(1)(i)(A). Some of these 
commenters argued that the Secretary does not have the statutory 
authority to establish a timeline and that meeting the timeline would 
be an excessive burden on States. Other commenters agreed with the 
concept of a timeline and offered suggestions as to what the timeline 
should be. Some commenters suggested that the regulations allow for 
State-determined timelines; others recommended timelines ranging from 
90 to 120 days following a State's submission of its APR to the 
Secretary; still others recommended a 60 day timeline beginning with a 
State's receipt of its annual determination from the Secretary. 
Commenters stated that a State-determined timeline or a timeline 
triggered by the State's receipt of it annual determination from the 
Secretary would allow for a more careful analysis of individual LEA 
data, thereby ensuring more accurate public reporting on the 
performance of each LEA.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.602(b)(1)(i)(A) implements section 
616(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act. Although the Act is silent on the 
timeline for public reporting, section 607(a) of the Act provides that 
the Secretary shall issue regulations to the extent that such 
regulations are necessary to ensure that there is compliance with 
specific requirements of the Act. We proposed a timeline for public 
reporting in the NPRM because there was uncertainty in the field about 
reporting requirements. Specifically, following the publication of the 
Part B regulations in 2006, the Department received many informal 
inquiries from SEA personnel and other interested parties regarding the 
timeline for reporting information to the public about LEAs' 
performance relative to its State's targets. It is still the 
Department's position, after consideration of the comments, that 
establishing a definitive timeline is necessary to ensure that each 
State provides timely information to the public.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We agree, however, with the commenters who suggested that an 
extended timeline would allow for more accurate analysis of LEA data, 
thereby improving the quality of information reported to the public 
and, ultimately, contributing to improved outcomes for children with 
disabilities and their families. Additionally, extending the timeline 
will reduce the burden associated with establishing a timeline for 
public reporting. Therefore, we have revised the timeline in Sec.  
300.602(b)(1)(i)(A) to require a State to report annually on the 
performance of each LEA located in the State on the targets in the 
State's SPP as soon as practicable but no later than 120 days following 
the submission of its APR to the Secretary under Sec.  300.602(b)(2).
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: We have replaced the 60 day timeline in Sec.  
300.602(b)(2) with the requirement that the State report on the 
performance of each LEA located in the State on the targets in the 
State's SPP as soon as practicable but no later than 120 days following 
the State's submission of its APR to the Secretary.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter suggested that changes to Sec.  300.602 are 
not necessary and that issuing administrative guidance on public 
reporting requirements, including timelines, would be more appropriate.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Public accountability is served by requiring States to 
make the documents referenced in Sec.  300.602(b)(1)(i)(B) available to 
the public within a specific timeframe. A regulation provides a degree 
of certainty on the timing of notice to the public that administrative 
guidance would not. We are aware that a number of States did not post 
public reports on LEA performance for FFY 2005 year by the time they 
submitted their APRs on FFY 2006. Therefore, regulatory action, rather 
than non-regulatory guidance is needed to ensure the proper and 
effective implementation of the requirements of Part B of the Act.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: None.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: One commenter noted that proposed Sec.  
300.602(b)(1)(i)(B) differs from current Sec.  300.602(b) in that it 
refers to the State's Web site as opposed to the SEA's Web site. This 
commenter requested that the Department clarify whether the information 
must be posted on the SEA's or the State's Web site in instances where 
SEAs have Web sites that are separate from State government Web sites.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: We agree that the reference in the regulations should 
be to the SEA's Web site, rather than to the State's Web site, and have 
made this change.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes: Sections 300.602(b)(1)(i)(B) and 300.606 have been revised 
to require posting on the SEA's Web site, rather than the State Web 
site.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment: Another commenter requested that the Department clarify 
each State's obligation to make public any former reports on the 
performance of the LEAs within the State as well as the time frame when 
this information must be made available to the public.
</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Neither the Act nor the regulations address the public 
posting of reports on the performance of the LEAs that were issued 
prior to the promulgation of these regulations. Posting historical 
documents related to the implementation of the IDEA on an SEA's Web 
site may be beneficial, but it is not required by the Act or the 
regulations implementing Part B of the Act. The decision to post 
historical documents and a timeline for posting these reports and 
notices would be most appropriately decided by each State.

Changes: None.
