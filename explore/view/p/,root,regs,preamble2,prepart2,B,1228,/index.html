Filing a complaint (Sec. 300.153)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended the regulations include a limit on the number of times that an individual may file a State complaint against a public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An SEA is required to resolve any complaint that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.153, including complaints that raise systemic issues, and individual child complaints.  It would be inconsistent with the Act's provisions in section 616 regarding enforcement and the Act's provisions in section 612 regarding general supervision for an SEA to have a State complaint procedure that removes or limits a party's right to file a complaint that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, including limiting the number of times a party can file a complaint with the SEA.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to include in the regulations the language suggested by the commenter, nor should the SEA include in its State complaint procedures any restriction on the number of times a party can file a complaint, as long as the complaint meets the requirements of Sec. 300.153. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters requested retaining current Sec. 300.662(c), which permits a complaint to be filed about a violation that occurred more than one year prior to the date the complaint is received if the violation is continuing or the complainant is requesting compensatory services for a violation that occurred more than three years prior to the date the complaint is received.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Some commenters requested that the regulations permit a parent to have as much time to file a State complaint as a parent would have to file a due process complaint (two years, unless provided otherwise by State law).  One commenter stated that extensions of the statute of limitations should be granted when circumstances warrant an extension.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Another commenter suggested adding language providing that the timeline begins when a parent first learns about the violation.  A few commenters stated that parents need a longer statute of limitations for State complaints because they do not always know about violations when they occur and may not fully understand how the violation affects their child's education.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters stated that Congress did not intend to create a one-year statute of limitations for State complaints when it created a two-year statute of limitations for due process hearings.  Several commenters stated that there is no evidence that Congress intended to change the current three-year statute of limitations on the parents' right to file a State complaint when the violation is ongoing or compensatory services are being requested.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe a one-year timeline is reasonable, and will assist in smooth implementation of the State complaint procedures.  The references to longer periods for continuing violations and for compensatory services claims in current Sec. 300.662(c) were removed to ensure expedited resolution for public agencies and children with disabilities.  Limiting a complaint to a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date that the complaint is received will help ensure that problems are raised and addressed promptly so that children receive FAPE.  We believe longer time limits are not generally effective and beneficial to the child because the issues in a State complaint become so stale that they are unlikely to be resolved.  However, States may choose to accept and resolve complaints regarding alleged violations that occurred outside the one-year timeline, just as they are free to add additional protections in other areas that are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is necessary to retain the language in current Sec. 300.662(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is appropriate to change the timeline to begin when a parent first learns about the violation, as suggested by the commenter, because such a provision could lead to some complaints being filed well beyond one year from the time the violation actually occurred.  This also would make the issue of the complaint so stale that the SEA would not be able to reasonably resolve the complaint and recommend an appropriate corrective action.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	As we stated earlier in the Analysis of Comments and Changes for this subpart, Congress did not specifically address or detail a State complaint process in the Act; nor did Congress express an opinion regarding the time limit for filing a complaint under a State's complaint process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.153(c) appears to indicate that if a State complaint is also the subject of a due process complaint the time period to file the complaint is two years, rather than the one-year time limit applicable for all other State complaints.  Several commenters stated that this provision should be removed and that a one-year limitation should apply to all State complaints, regardless of whether a request for a due process hearing is filed on the issue(s) in the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a State complaint contains multiple issues of which one or more is part of a due process hearing, the one-year statute of limitations would apply to the issues that are resolved under the State complaint procedures; the State due process statute of limitations would apply to the issues that are the subject of the due process hearing.  We agree that the language in Sec. 300.153 is confusing and will amend the language to remove the reference to the due process complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the phrase, "Except for complaints covered under Sec. 300.507(a)(2)" in Sec. 300.153(c).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.153(d) that requires the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child at the same time the party files the complaint with the SEA.  One commenter stated that filing a complaint is onerous enough for parents, without including an extra step of requiring a copy of the complaint to be forwarded to the school.  One commenter stated that this poses an unnecessary paperwork burden on parents.  A few commenters stated that forwarding a copy of the complaint to the LEA should be the responsibility of the SEA, not the parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter expressed concern that requiring the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child will discourage parents or school personnel whistle blowers from filing a complaint and recommended instead, that the regulations require SEAs to provide the LEA with a concise statement of fact upon which the complaint is based and the provisions of laws and rules that are at issue.  A few commenters requested including language in Sec. 300.153(d) giving the SEA discretion to protect the confidentiality of the complainant.  A few commenters recommended removing the requirement in Sec. 300.153(b)(3) for the written complaint to include the signature and contact information for the complainant.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The purpose of requiring the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child, at the same time the party files the complaint with the SEA, is to ensure that the public agency involved has knowledge of the issues and an opportunity to resolve them directly with the complaining party at the earliest possible time.  The sooner the LEA knows that a complaint is filed and the nature of the issue(s), the quicker the LEA can work directly with the complainant to resolve the complaint.  We believe the benefit of having the complainant forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency far outweigh the minimal burden placed on the complainant because it will lead to a faster resolution of the complaint at the local level.  For these reasons, we also do not believe it is more efficient to have the SEA forward the complaint to the public agency or provide the public agency with a statement summarizing the complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe that the complaint procedures should provide for the confidentiality of the complainant.  The complainant should not remain unknown to the public agency that is the subject of the complaint because that public agency needs to know who the complainant is and something about the complaint (consistent with Sec. 300.153) before it can be expected to resolve the issues.  We believe it is reasonable to require a party to file a signed complaint and provide contact information to the SEA in order to ensure the credibility of the complaint and provide the SEA with the basic contact information necessary for the SEA to handle complaints expeditiously.  If the SEA receives a complaint that is not signed, as required in Sec. 300.153, the SEA may choose to dismiss the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that a parent must have legal knowledge in order to correctly file a State complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Contrary to the commenter's assertion that a parent must have legal knowledge to file a complaint, we believe the State complaint procedures, which are under the direct control of the SEA, provide the parent and the school district with mechanisms that allow them to resolve differences without having to resort to a more costly and cumbersome due process complaint, which, by its nature, is litigious.  We believe if a State effectively implements its State complaint procedures, both parents and public agencies will generally find the process efficient and easy to initiate.  We further believe that the requirement in Sec. 300.509 that each SEA must develop model forms to assist parents in filing a State complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, and in filing a due process complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.507(a) and 300.508(a) through (c), will make the process of filing such complaints much easier for parents and others.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have made a minor wording change in Sec. 300.153(b)(4) for clarity. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the complainant should not have to propose a resolution to the problem, as required in Sec. 300.153(b)(4)(v), in order to have the State investigate a complaint. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.153(b)(4)(v) requires the complainant to propose a resolution to the complaint only to the extent known and available to the complainant at the time the complaint is filed.  We believe this proposed resolution is necessary because it gives the complainant an opportunity to state what he or she believes to be the problem and how the complainant believes it can be resolved.  This is important because it gives the complainant an opportunity to tell the public agency what is wrong and what it would take to fix the problem from the complainant's point of view.  It also will give the LEA an opportunity to choose either to do as the complainant requests or propose a solution that it believes would resolve the issue raised by the complainant.  Thus, if successful, the parties will avoid an adversarial relationship and possibly the expense of a due process hearing. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.153(d) include language allowing an LEA to appeal an SEA finding to an administrative hearing or the courts.  Another commenter expressed concern that the State complaint procedures lack an appeals process for parties that lose under the State complaint procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The regulations neither prohibit nor require the establishment of procedures to permit an LEA or other party to request reconsideration of a State complaint decision.  We have chosen to be silent in the regulations about whether a State complaint decision may be appealed because we believe States are in the best position to determine what, if any, appeals process is necessary to meet each State's needs, consistent with State law.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a State chooses, however, to adopt a process for appealing a State complaint decision, such process may not waive any of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153. Section 300.152 requires that the SEA issue a final decision on each complaint within 60 calendar days after the complaint is filed, unless the SEA extends the timeline as provided in Sec. 300.152(b).  This means that, absent an appropriate extension of the timeline for a particular complaint, the State must issue a final decision within 60 calendar days.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, if after the SEA's final decision is issued, a party who has the right to request a due process hearing (that is, the parent or LEA) and who disagrees with the SEA's decision may initiate a due process hearing, provided that the subject of the State complaint involves an issue about which a due process hearing can be filed and the two-year statute of limitations for due process hearings (or other time limit imposed by State law) has not expired.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
