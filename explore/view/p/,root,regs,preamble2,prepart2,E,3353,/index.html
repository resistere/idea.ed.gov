Duties of public agency (Sec. 300.519(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A number of comments were received regarding the procedures for assigning surrogate parents.  One commenter recommended requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one.  The commenter stated that this would avoid situations in which the LEA and juvenile court each believe that the other is assuming this responsibility and a surrogate parent is never appointed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended that the process for assigning surrogate parents within the 30-day timeframe be developed in collaboration with judges and other child advocates.  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the involvement of child welfare agencies, homeless liaisons, and any other party who has knowledge about the needs of homeless children or children in foster care in determining whether a surrogate parent is needed. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to amend the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenters.  To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected, Sec. 300.519(b) requires public agencies to have a method for determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent and for assigning a surrogate parent to a child.  Such methods would include determining whether a court has already appointed a surrogate parent, as provided under Sec. 300.519(c).  Therefore, it is unnecessary to add language requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one, as requested by a commenter.  Section 300.519(d)(1) allows a public agency to select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law, and Sec. 300.519(h) requires the SEA to make reasonable efforts to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We believe that the determination of whether public agencies collaborate with other parties, such as child welfare agencies or homeless liaisons, in appointing surrogate parents is best left to State discretion.  There is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a public agency from collaborating with judges and child advocates in establishing a process for assigning surrogate parents, as recommended by the commenter.  However, in situations where a public agency involves other parties in determining whether a surrogate parent is needed, the public agency must ensure that the confidentiality of personally identifiable data, information, and records collected or maintained by SEAs and LEAs is protected in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and that the privacy of education records is protected under FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended retaining current Sec. 300.370(b)(2), which specifically mentions the recruitment and training of surrogate parents as a State-level activity for which funds provided under Part B of the Act may be used.  One commenter requested clarification as to who should provide training for surrogate parents.  A few commenters recommended that PTIs in each State be responsible for training surrogate parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to retain current Sec. 300.370(b)(2) in order to permit the continued use of funds provided under Part B of the Act for the recruitment and training of surrogate parents.  Section 300.704(b) and section 611(e)(2)(C)(i) of the Act provide that funds reserved for other State-level activities may be used for support and direct services, including technical assistance, personnel preparation, and professional development and training.  This would include the recruitment and training of surrogate parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Determinations regarding who should conduct the training for surrogate parents are best left to the discretion of States and local officials.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires or prohibits surrogate parent training to be conducted by PTIs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that a child have the same surrogate parent for each IEP Team meeting, eligibility meeting, and other meetings in which a parent's presence is requested by the public agency. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act and these regulations do not address the length of time that a surrogate parent must serve.  Nor do we believe that it would be appropriate to impose a uniform rule in light of the wide variety of circumstances that might arise related to a child's need for a surrogate parent.  Even so, to minimize disruption for the child, public agencies should take steps to ensure that the individual appointed as a surrogate parent can serve in that capacity over the period of time that the child needs a surrogate. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
