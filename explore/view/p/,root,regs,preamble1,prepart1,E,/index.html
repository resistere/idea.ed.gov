(2)  Section 300.502(c) has been changed to clarify that if a parent obtains an independent evaluation at public expense or shares with the public agency an evaluation obtained at private expense, the public agency must consider the evaluation, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to the child.  </p></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">
Section 300.504 (Procedural safeguards notice) has been revised, as follows:<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble1%2Cprepart1%2CE%2C100%2C">[select]</a><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.506(b), regarding the requirements for mediation, has been revised by (1) removing the provision about the "confidentiality pledge," in proposed paragraph (b)(9), because it is no longer required under the Act, and (2) changing paragraph (b)(8), regarding the prohibition against using discussions that occur in the mediation process, to clarify that "civil proceedings" includes any Federal court or State court of a State receiving assistance under this part.<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble1%2Cprepart1%2CE%2C103%2C">[select]</a></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

(2)  A new Sec. 300.510(b)(3) has been added to provide that, except where the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation (notwithstanding Sec. 300.510(b)(1) and (2)), the failure of a parent filing a due process complaint to participate in the resolution meeting will delay the timelines for the resolution process and due process hearing until the meeting is held.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(3)  A new Sec. 300.510(b)(4) has been added to provide that if an LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting after reasonable efforts have been made, and documented using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d), the LEA may, at the conclusion of the 30-day resolution period, request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Section 300.518 (Child's status during proceedings) has been revised by adding a new paragraph (c), which provides that if a complaint involves an application for initial services under this part from a child who is transitioning from Part C of the Act to Part B and is no longer eligible for Part C services because the child has turned 3, the public agency is not required to provide the Part C services that the child had been receiving.  If the child is found eligible for special education and related services under Part B and the parent consents to the initial provision of special education and related services under Sec. 300.300(b), then the public agency must provide those special education and related services that are not in dispute between the parent and the public agency.<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble1%2Cprepart1%2CE%2C115%2C">[select]</a></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">
Section 300.520(b), regarding a special rule about the transfer of parental rights at the age of majority, has been revised to more clearly state that a State must establish procedures for appointing the parent of a child with a disability, or if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual, to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act if, under State law, a child who has reached the age of majority, but has not been determined to be incompetent, can be determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to the child's educational program.<a href="/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2Cpreamble1%2Cprepart1%2CE%2C116%2C">[select]</a></p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

Section 300.530(d)(4), regarding the removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement for 10 school days in the same school year, has been revised to remove the reference to school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the child's teachers, determining the location in which services will be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.530(d)(5), regarding removals that constitute a change of placement under Sec. 300.536, has been revised to remove the reference to the IEP Team determining the location in which services will be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A new Sec. 300.530(e)(3), has been added to provide that, if the LEA, the parent, and members of the child's IEP Team determine that the child's behavior was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP, the LEA must take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.530(h), regarding notification, has been changed to specify that, on the date on which a decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change in the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA must notify the parents of that decision, and provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.532 (Appeal) has been revised, as follows:</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(1)  Paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.532, regarding the conditions in which the parent of a child with a disability or an LEA may request a hearing, has been modified to clarify that the hearing is requested by filing a complaint pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.507 and 300.508(a) and (b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(2)  Section 300.532(b)(3) has been changed to more definitively provide that if the LEA believes that returning the child to his or her original placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(3)  Section 300.532(c)(3), regarding an expedited due process hearing, has been adjusted to provide that unless the parents and an LEA agree in writing to waive a resolution meeting, or agree to use the mediation process described in Sec. 300.506, the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the due process complaint, and the hearing may proceed within 15 days of receipt of the due process complaint unless the matter has been resolved to satisfaction of both parties.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
(4)  Proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), regarding the two-day timeframe for disclosing information to the opposing party prior to an expedited due process hearing, has been removed. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 500.536(a)(2)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2)) has been revised to remove the requirement that a child's behavior must have been a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) has also been amended to reference the child's behavior in "previous" incidents that resulted in the series of removals.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A new Sec. 300.536(b) has been added to clarify that the public agency (subject to review through the due process and judicial proceedings) makes the determination, on a case-by-case basis, whether a pattern of removals constitutes a change in placement and that the determination is subject to review through due process and judicial determinations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A new Sec. 300.537 (State enforcement mechanisms) has been added to clarify that notwithstanding Sec. 300.506(b)(7) and Sec. 300.510(c)(2), which provide for judicial enforcement of a written agreement reached as a result of a mediation or resolution meeting, nothing in this part would prevent the SEA from using other mechanisms to seek enforcement of that agreement, provided that use of those mechanisms is not mandatory and does not delay or deny a party the right to seek enforcement of the written agreement in a State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.</p></p>
