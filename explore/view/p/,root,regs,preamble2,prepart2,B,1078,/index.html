Location of services and transportation (Sec. 300.139)  <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters asked for clarification as to how the location where services will be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities is determined.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Under Sec. 300.134(d), how, where, and by whom special education and related services are provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities are subjects of the process of consultation among LEA officials, private school representatives, and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  Further, Sec. 300.137(b)(2) clarifies that, after this consultation process, the final decision with respect to the services provided to eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities is made by the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended specifying that providing services on the premises of private elementary schools and secondary schools is the preferred means of serving parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  A few commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.139(a) to stipulate that services "should" or "must" be provided on the premises of private schools, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  In contrast, several commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the NPRM that services should be provided on-site unless there is a compelling rationale to provide services off-site.  A few of these commenters stated that the Act does not indicate a preference for one location of services over another and the Department has no authority to provide such a strong comment on this issue.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Services offered to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may be provided on-site at a child's private school, including a religious school, to the extent consistent with law, or at another location.  The Department believes, in the interests of the child, LEAs should provide services on site at the child's private school so as not to unduly disrupt the child's educational experience, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  The phrase "to the extent consistent with law" is in section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act.  We interpret this language to mean that the provision of services on the premises of a private school takes place in a manner that would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would not be inconsistent with applicable State constitutions or law.  We, therefore, do not have the statutory authority to require that services be provided on-site.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that Sec. 300.139(b), regarding transportation services, goes beyond the requirements in the Act and should be removed.  A few commenters stated that transportation is a related service and should be treated as such with respect to parentally-placed children with disabilities in private schools.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that transportation services should be removed from Sec. 300.139(b).  If services are offered at a site separate from the child's private school, transportation may be necessary to get the child to and from that other site.  Failure to provide transportation could effectively deny the child an opportunity to benefit from the services that the LEA has determined through consultation to offer its parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In this situation, although transportation is not a related service, as defined in Sec. 300.34, transportation is necessary to enable the child to participate and to make the offered services accessible to the child.  LEAs should work in consultation with representatives of private school children to ensure that services are provided at sites, including on the premises of the child's private school, so that LEAs do not incur significant transportation costs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
However, for some children with disabilities, special modifications in transportation may be necessary to address the child's unique needs.  If the group developing the child's services plan determines that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability chosen to receive services requires transportation as a related service in order to receive special education services, this transportation service should be included as a related service in the services plan for the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In either case, the LEA may include the cost of the transportation in calculating whether it has met the requirement of Sec. 300.133. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
