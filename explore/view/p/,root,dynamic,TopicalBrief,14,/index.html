Bush.  The provisions of the act became effective on July 1, 2005, with the exception of some of the elements pertaining to the definition of a &ldquo;highly qualified teacher&rdquo; that took effect upon the signing of the act.  This is one in a series of documents, prepared by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) in the U.S. Department of Education, that covers a variety of high-interest topics and brings together the statutory language related to those topics to support constituents in preparing to implement the new requirements.<sup><a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" class="sdfootnoteanc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>  This document addresses only the changes to the provisions of IDEA regarding the Part C option to make Part C services available to children after age 3 that   became effective on July 1, 2005.  It does not address any changes that may be made by the final regulations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 class="western">IDEA 2004:</h1> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 class="western">1.  Allows flexibility to make Part C services available to children from age 3 until eligible <br />     to enter kindergarten or elementary school.</h1> <p>A statewide system described in Section 633 may include a state policy, developed and implemented jointly by the lead agency and the state education agency (SEA), under which parents of children with disabilities who are eligible for services under Section 619, and previously received services under Part C, may choose the continuation of early intervention services (which shall include an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates preliteracy, language and numeracy skills) for such children under Part C until such children enter, or are eligible under state law to enter, kindergarten.

Adds requirements in implementing this option.</h1> <h1 class="western">If a statewide system includes the option under Section 635(c)(1), the statewide system shall ensure that:</h1> <ul><li><p style="page-break-after: avoid">Parents  of children with disabilities served pursuant to Section 635(c) are  provided annual notice that contains:</p>  <ul><li><p>A description of the rights of   such parents to elect to receive early intervention services   pursuant to Section 635(c) or under Part B; and</p>   </li><li><p>An explanation of the   differences between services provided pursuant to Section 635(c)   and services provided under Part B, including:  (1) types of   services and the locations at which the services are provided; (2)   applicable procedural safeguards; and (3) possible costs (including   any fees to be charged to families as described in Section   632(4)(B)), if any, to parents of infants or toddlers with   disabilities;</p>  </li></ul> </li></ul> <ul><li><p>Services provided pursuant to  Section 635(c) include an educational component that promotes school  readiness and incorporates preliteracy, language and numeracy  skills;</p>  </li><li><p>The state policy will not affect  the right of any child served pursuant to Section 635(c) to instead  receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under Part B;</p>  </li><li><p>All early intervention services  outlined in the child&#39;s individualized family service plan (IFSP)  under Section 636 are continued while any eligibility determination  is being made for services under Section 635(c);</p>  </li><li><p>The parents of infants or  toddlers with disabilities (as defined in Section 632(5)(A)) provide  informed written consent to the state, before such infants or  toddlers reach 3 years of age, as to whether such parents intend to  choose the continuation of early intervention services pursuant to  Section 635(c) for such infants or toddlers;</p>  </li><li><p>The requirements under Section  637(a)(9) shall not apply with respect to a child who is receiving  services in accordance with Section 635(c) until not less than 90  days (and at the discretion of the parties to the conference, not  more than nine months) before the time the child will no longer  receive those services; and</p> </li></ul> <ul><li><p>There will be a referral for  evaluation for early intervention services of a child who  experiences a substantiated case of trauma due to exposure to family  violence (as defined in Section 320 of the <em>Family Violence  Prevention and Services Act</em>).</p> </li></ul> <p>[635(c)(2)]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 class="western">4.  Adds a reporting requirement.<span> </span> </h1> <p>If a statewide system includes the option under Section 635(c)(1), the state shall submit to the secretary, in the state&#39;s report under Section 637(b)(4)(A), a report on the number and percentage of children with disabilities who are eligible for services under Section 619 but whose parents choose for such children to continue to receive early intervention services under Part C.  635(c)(3)]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1 class="western">5.  Requires identification of funding sources in the state&rsquo;s policy.</h1> <p>If a statewide system includes the option under Section 635(c)(1), the<strong> </strong>policy shall describe the funds (including an identification as federal, state or local funds) that will be used to ensure that the option described in Section 635(c)(1) is available to eligible children and families who provide the consent described in Section 635(c)(2)(E), including fees, if any, to be charged to families as described in Section 632(4)(B).

Nothing in Section 635(c) shall be construed to require a provider of services under Part C to provide a child served under Part C with FAPE.  [635(c)(5)]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A state that provides early intervention services in accordance with Part C to a child who is eligible for services under Section 619, is not required to provide such child with FAPE.

Allows the use of funds for the Part C option.</h1> <p>In addition to using funds provided under Section 633 to maintain and implement the statewide system required by Section 633, a state may use such funds &hellip; with the written consent of the parents, to continue to provide early intervention services under Part C to children with disabilities from their third birthday until such children enter, or are eligible under state law to enter, kindergarten, in lieu of FAPE provided in accordance with Part B.  [638(4)]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under Section 644 exceeds $460,000,000, the secretary shall reserve 15 percent of such appropriated amount to provide grants to states that are carrying out the policy described in Section 635(c) in order to facilitate the implementation of such policy.
