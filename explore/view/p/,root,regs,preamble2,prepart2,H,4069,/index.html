Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 does not require you to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number.  We display the valid OMB control numbers assigned to the collections of information in these final regulations at the end of the affected sections of the regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
These final regulations include 9 information collection requirements associated with the following provisions:  Sec. Sec. 300.100 through 300.176, Sec. 300.182, Sec. 300.199, Sec. Sec. 300.201 through 300.213, Sec. 300.224, Sec. 300.226, Sec. Sec. 300.506 through 300.507, Sec. 300.511, Sec. Sec. 300.601 through 300.602, Sec. 300.640, Sec. 300.704, and Sec. 300.804.  A description of these provisions is given below with an estimate of the annual recordkeeping burden.  Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing each collection of information.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Annual State Application under Part B of the Act.  Sec. Sec. 300.100 through 300.176, Sec. 300.182, and Sec. 300.804.  Each State is eligible for assistance under Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the State submits a plan that provides assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the State meets the eligibility criteria under Part B of the Act and these final regulations.  Under the Act, States are no longer required to have on file with the Secretary policies and procedures to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State meets specific conditions for assistance under Part B of the Act.  Information collection 1820-0030 has been revised to reflect this change in the Act and these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average twelve hours for each response for 60 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0030 is estimated to be 720 hours.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Collection of Information:  Part B State Performance Plan (SPP) and Annual Performance Report (APR).  Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.602.  Each State must have in place, not later than one year after the date of enactment of the Act, a performance plan that evaluates the State's efforts to implement the requirements and purposes of Part B of the Act and these final regulations and describe how the State will improve such implementation.  Each State shall report annually to the public on the performance of each LEA located in the State on the targets in the State's performance plan.  The State must report annually to the Secretary on the performance of the State under the State's performance plan.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 325 hours for each response for 60 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0624 is estimated to be 19,500 hours. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Report of Children with Disabilities Receiving Special Education under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Sec. Sec. 300.640 through 300.645.  Each State that receives assistance under Part B of the Act shall provide data each year to the Secretary and the public on children with disabilities by race/ethnicity, disability, gender, and limited English proficiency status receiving special education and related services in each State.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection is estimated to average 9 hours for each of 60 State agencies and 2 hours for LEAs in each State.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for collection 1820-0043 is 33,276 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Report of Children with Disabilities Subject to Disciplinary Removal.  Sec. 300.640.  Each State must provide data to the Secretary and the public by race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency status, gender, and disability category on children with disabilities who are removed to an interim alternative educational setting and the acts or items precipitating those removals.  Data must also be reported by race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency status, gender, and disability category on the number of children with disabilities who are subject to long-term suspensions or expulsions.  In addition, data must be reported on the number and percentage of children with disabilities who are removed to alternative educational settings or expelled as compared to children without disabilities, and on the incidence and duration of disciplinary actions, including suspensions of one day or more.  Information collection 1820-0621 has been revised to reflect the new statutory requirements and the final regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and record keeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 17.5 hours for each of an average of 260 LEAs per State to collect, review, and report the data and 74 hours per State agency (60) to collect, maintain, and report these data.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0621 for all States (60) is estimated to be 277,440 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Personnel (in Full-Time Equivalency of Assignments) Employed to Provide Special Education and Related Services for Children with Disabilities.  Sec. 300.640, Sec. 300.642, and Sec. 300.645.  Each LEA must ensure that all personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and each SEA must establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including that those personnel have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  To help ensure that these requirements are met, the Secretary must collect data that can be used to monitor these requirements.  Information collection 1820-0518 has been revised to reflect the new statutory requirements and the final regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.5 hours for each of an average of 260 LEAs per State and 2.5 hours for each of 60 State agencies.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0518 for all States is 7,950 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Report of Children with Disabilities Exiting Special Education.  Sec. 300.640.  Each State must report to the Secretary children by race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency status, gender, and disability category, the number of children with disabilities aged 14 through 21 who stopped receiving special education and related services because of program completion (including graduation with a regular secondary school diploma), or other reasons, and the reasons why those children stopped receiving special education and related services.  Information collection 1820-0521 has been revised to reflect the new statutory requirements and the final regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 6 hours for each of an average of 260 LEAs per State and 11 hours for each of 60 State agencies.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0521 for all States is 94,260 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Part B, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Implementation of FAPE Requirements.  Sec. 300.640.  Each State must provide to the Secretary and the public data on children with disabilities by race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency status, gender, and disability category who are receiving a free appropriate public education, participating in regular education, in separate classes, separate schools or facilities, or public or private residential facilities.  Information collection 1820-0517 has been revised to reflect the new statutory requirement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 27 hours for each of an average of 260 LEAs per State and 28 hours for each of 60 State agencies.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0517 for all States is 422,880 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  Report of Dispute Resolution Under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act:  Complaints, Mediations, and Due Process Hearings.  Sec. 300.640.  Each State must report to the Secretary and the public, the number of due process complaints filed under section 615 of the Act and the number of hearings conducted; the number of hearings requested under section 615(k) of the Act and the number of changes in placement ordered as a result of those hearings; and the number of mediations held and the number of settlement agreements reached through those mediations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 70 hours for each of 60 State agencies.  Thus, the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0677 is estimated to be 4,200 hours.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Collection of Information:  State and LEA Record Keeping and Reporting Requirements under Part B.  Sec. 300.132, Sec. Sec. 300.134 through 300.136, Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, Sec. Sec. 300.201 through 300.213, Sec. 300.224, Sec. 300.226, Sec. 300.504, Sec. 300.506, Sec. 300.507, Sec. 300.511, and Sec. 300.704.  The Act requires States and LEAs to gather, maintain, and report various information and data, but the Act does not require this information and data to be submitted to the Department.  In the NPRM, these requirements were reflected in separate information collections.  For the purpose of clarity and efficiency we have combined these separate collections of information into one collection that reflects all the record keeping and reporting that must be completed at the State or LEA level, which do not require reporting to the Department.  The following collections of information referenced in the NPRM are combined into information collection 1820-0600:  LEA Application under Part B of the Act; List of Hearing Officers and Mediators, Complaint Procedures; LEA Consultation with Private School Representatives; Private School Complaint of Noncompliance with Consultation Requirements; Identification of State-Imposed Rules, Regulations, or Policies; Number of Children with Disabilities Enrolled in Private Schools by Their Parents; State Plan for High Cost Fund; Free and Low-Cost Legal Services; and Confidentiality Pledge Prior to the Commencement of Mediation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to approximately 6 hours for 79,194 respondents (LEAs and State agencies).  The total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden for information collection 1820-0600 for all States and LEAs is 472,651 hours.</p></p>
