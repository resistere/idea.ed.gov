Procedural safeguards notice (Sec. 300.504)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many comments were received regarding when the procedural safeguards notice must be provided to parents.  One commenter stated that these requirements add paperwork and procedural burdens.  Several commenters expressed concern that parents will have knowledge of their procedural safeguards only when they file a State complaint or request a due process hearing.  Some commenters recommended deleting the requirement in Sec. 300.504(a)(2) for the public agency to give parents the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint or due process hearing in the school year.  Other commenters suggested amending Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to require that the procedural safeguards notice be provided to parents upon receipt of the first due process complaint in that school year.  Some commenters asked whether parents would receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice only upon the first filing of a State complaint or a due process complaint, but not twice, if a parent submits a complaint and also a request for a due process hearing in the same school year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter was concerned that the parents of a child with a disability who transfers into a new school will not be notified of their procedural rights in a timely manner.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(a) reflects the new statutory language in section 615(d)(1) of the Act, regarding the timing of the procedural safeguards notice.  Section 300.504(a)(1) and (4), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, states that a copy of the procedural safeguards must be given to parents one time a year, except that a copy must also be given to parents upon initial referral or parent request for evaluation; upon receipt of the first State complaint and due process complaint in that school year; and upon request by a parent.  There is no longer a requirement that the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents upon notification of each IEP Team meeting, as in current Sec. 300.504(a).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We disagree that Sec. 300.504(a)(2) should be removed.  The Department intends for parents to receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and upon receipt of the first due process complaint under Sec. 300.507 in a school year because we believe that parents particularly need a clear understanding of their rights when they embark on these processes and might not have available copies of the procedural safeguards notice provided earlier in the year, or the notice they previously received may be outdated.  We are changing Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to make this clear.  We also are changing Sec. 300.504(a) to specify that the statutory phrase "one time a year" refers to "one time a school year."  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Regarding the concern that a parent whose child transfers to a new school district might not receive appropriate notice of the Act's procedural safeguards, we do not believe that additional clarification is necessary.  We believe that these regulatory provisions are sufficient to ensure that the parent of a child who changes school districts receives the requisite notice in a timely manner.  When the child with a disability transfers to a new school district, that school district would have an obligation to ensure that the child's parents are provided notice at least once in that school year and at the other times specified in Sec. 300.504(a).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.504(a) are necessary to ensure that parents have information about the due process procedures when they are most likely to need them and do not view these requirements as unduly burdensome.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.504(a)(2) has been changed to require public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 in a school year and upon receipt of the first due process complaint under Sec. 300.507 in a school year.  We have also changed paragraph (a) in Sec. 300.504 to clarify that the statutory phrase "one time a year" refers to a "school" year.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents when a decision has been made to take disciplinary action.  Another commenter recommended that the procedural safeguards notice be given at the time a manifestation determination is reviewed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act requires public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice not later than the date on which the decision to take disciplinary action is made.  Therefore, we are adding this requirement in Sec. 300.504(a).  We will not add a requirement for public agencies to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice following the manifestation determination conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), because it would be unnecessarily duplicative to require a procedural safeguards notice to be provided both prior to and after a decision to take disciplinary action has been made.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (3) has been added in Sec. 300.504(a) to require the procedural safeguards notice to be provided to parents in accordance with the discipline procedures in Sec. 300.530(h).  The subsequent paragraph has been renumbered, consistent with this change.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested that public agencies inform parents when the procedural safeguards notice has been revised, so that parents can request the updated version.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion: Section 300.504(c), consistent with section 615(d) of the Act, lists the required contents of the procedural safeguards notice.  If these requirements change because of changes made to the Act, public agencies would be required to change their procedural safeguards notice accordingly.  Such changes, along with any additional changes to a State's rules, would be subject to the public participation requirements in Sec. 300.165 and section 612(a)(19) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring that the procedural safeguards notice include a parent's right to request the credentials of any teacher who supports the child in the educational environment, as well as documentation regarding the type of supervision provided for any teacher who is supervised by a highly qualified teacher.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The content of the procedural safeguards notice is based on the items listed in section 615(d)(2) of the Act, which do not include providing information about teachers' credentials and personnel qualifications in a procedural safeguards notice, as requested by the commenter.  Nor is there any requirement elsewhere in the Act for public agencies to provide information about teachers' credentials and personnel qualifications.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 1111(h)(6) of the ESEA, however, requires LEAs to inform parents about the quality of a school's teachers in title I schools.  Under the ESEA, an LEA that accepts title I, part A funding must notify parents of students in title I schools that they can request information regarding their child's teacher, including, at a minimum:  (1) whether the teacher has met State requirements for licensure and certification for the grade level(s) and subject-matter(s) in which the teacher provides instruction; (2) whether the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which State qualification or licensing criteria has been waived; (3) the college major and any other graduate certifications or degrees held by the teacher, and the field of discipline of the certifications or degrees; and (4) whether the child is provided services by paraprofessionals, and if so, their qualifications.  In addition, each title I school must provide each parent timely notice that the parent's child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks, by a teacher who is not highly qualified.  These requirements also apply to special education teachers who teach core academic subjects in title I schools.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern with allowing LEAs to post the procedural safeguards notice on the school's Web site.  Several commenters asked whether directing a parent to the Web site constitutes distribution of the notice under the Act.  One commenter suggested adding specific language to the regulations stating that posting the notice on the school Web site does not replace other Part B requirements regarding distribution of the notice.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(b), incorporates section 615(d)(1)(B) of the Act, and permits, but does not require, a public agency to post a current copy of the procedural safeguards notice on its Web site, if one exists.  The public agency would not meet its obligation in Sec. 300.504(a) by simply directing a parent to the Web site.  Rather, a public agency must still offer parents a printed copy of the procedural safeguards notice.  If, however, a parent declines the offered printed copy of the notice and indicates a clear preference to obtain the notice electronically on their own from the agency's Web site, it would be reasonable for the public agency to document that it offered a printed copy of the notice that the parent declined.  Posting the procedural safeguards notice on a public agency's Web site is clearly optional and for the convenience of the public and does not replace the distribution requirements in the Act.  We do not believe it is necessary to add a regulation to clarify this.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have removed the "or" in Sec. 300.504(c)(5) and replaced it with "and" to require that the procedural safeguards notice include a full explanation of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We are aware of the fact that over the years there has been much confusion about exactly what must be included in the procedural safeguards notice.  To help clear up this confusion, the Department is publishing a model procedural safeguards notice on its Web site today in accordance with section 617(e) of the Act.  In addition to making this model procedural safeguards notice available on the Department's Web site, we also are amending the cross-references in Sec. 300.504(c) to identify the specific regulatory provisions that include procedural safeguards for which an explanation must be provided in the procedural safeguards notice.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised the cross-references to specific regulatory sections in the introductory paragraph of Sec. 300.504(c), consistent with the content listed in Sec. 300.504(c)(1) through (13).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters asked that the regulations require a State to develop its procedural safeguards notice with the State's PTIs and CPRCs to ensure that it is appropriate for parents.  One commenter recommended including contact information for PTIs and CPRCs in the notice.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.165 and section 612(a)(19) of the Act require each State to ensure that there are public hearings, adequate notice of the hearings, and an opportunity for comment available to the general public, including individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities, prior to adopting any policies and procedures to comply with Part B of the Act.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from consulting representatives of PTIs, CPRCs, or other advocacy organizations for assistance in developing the procedural safeguards notice so that it is appropriate for parents and the general public.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	It would be unnecessarily prescriptive to require States to consult with representatives from particular organizations in developing their procedural safeguards notice or to require that a State's procedural safeguards notice include contact information for particular organizations.  We believe that such decisions are best left to States.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters suggested requiring the procedural safeguards notice to explain how a resolution meeting works and the responsibilities of parents who participate in a resolution meeting.  Some commenters recommended requiring public agencies to inform parents in writing about the differences between mediation and resolution meetings including the differences in confidentiality rules; whether attorneys' fees may be reimbursed; the effect of resolution and mediation sessions on due process hearing timelines; and the requirements governing the execution of resolution and mediation agreements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.504(c)(6), consistent with section 615(d)(2)(E)(iii) of the Act, requires the procedural safeguards notice to include a full explanation regarding the availability of mediation to resolve complaints.  In addition, Sec. 300.504(c)(5) requires the procedural safeguards notice to provide a full explanation of the opportunity for parents to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and State complaint procedures, including the time period in which to file a complaint, the opportunity for the agency to resolve the complaint, and the differences between the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures, including the jurisdiction of each procedure, what issues may be raised, filing and decisional timelines, and relevant procedures.  Because resolution meetings are part of the due process procedures, consistent with Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, the explanation of due process procedures would necessarily include information about how the resolution meeting works and the responsibilities of the parties in the resolution meeting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe it is necessary to require the procedural safeguards notice to explain the differences between mediation and resolution meetings because the differences will be apparent from the clear explanations of the respective procedures that are already required in the notice.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from describing the differences between mediation and resolution meetings in its procedural safeguards notice, if it chose to do so.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters requested clarification regarding the differences between the State complaint and due process complaint procedures that are required to be included in the procedural safeguards notice.  Some commenters requested clarification regarding the meaning of the phrases "jurisdiction of each procedure" and "what issues may be raised" in State complaints versus due process complaints.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is important for public agencies to include an explanation of the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and the due process complaint procedures in Sec. 300.507 in the procedural safeguards notice to assist parents in understanding the differences between these procedures.  The reference to "jurisdictional issues" addresses the scope of the State complaint and due process complaint procedures.  An organization or individual may file a State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 alleging that a public agency has violated a requirement of the Act for a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date on which the complaint is received, unless one of the exceptions in Sec. 300.153(c) is applicable.  The Department's longstanding position is that a State must resolve any complaint, and may not remove from the jurisdiction of its State complaint procedures complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child simply because those issues also could be the subject of a due process complaint.  We view the State complaint procedures as a very important tool in a State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities, consistent with sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a) of the Act, to monitor LEA implementation of the requirements in Part B of the Act.  These responsibilities extend to both systemic and child-specific issues.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A parent or a public agency may file a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507 on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to such child for an alleged violation that occurred not more than two years (or, within the timeframe established by the State) before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
