          <h2>ESEA : Section 1114 </h2><p>Section 1114 of the ESEA states that a local educational agency may consolidate and use funds under this part, together with other Federal, State, and local funds, in order to upgrade the entire educational program of a school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families, or not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families.  (2) IDENTIFICATION OF STUDENTS NOT REQUIRED-(A) IN GENERAL- No school participating in a schoolwide program shall be required     (i) to identify particular children under this part as eligible to participate in a schoolwide program; or (ii) to provide services to such children that are supplementary, as otherwise required by section 1120A(b).  (B) SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS- A school participating in a schoolwide program shall use funds available to carry out this section only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds under this part, be made available from non-Federal sources for the school, including funds needed to provide services that are required by law for children with disabilities and children with limited English proficiency.  (3) EXEMPTION FROM STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS-(A) EXEMPTION- Except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary may, through publication of a notice in the Federal Register, exempt schoolwide programs under this section from statutory or regulatory provisions of any other noncompetitive formula grant program administered by the Secretary (other than formula or discretionary grant programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, except as provided in section 613(a)(2)(D) of such Act), or any discretionary grant program administered by the Secretary, to support schoolwide programs if the intent and purposes of such other programs are met.  (B) REQUIREMENTS- A school that chooses to use funds from such other programs shall not be relieved of the requirements relating to health, safety, civil rights, student and parental participation and involvement, services to private school children, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, uses of Federal funds to supplement, not supplant non-Federal funds, or the distribution of funds to State educational agencies or local educational agencies that apply to the receipt of funds from such programs.  (C) RECORDS- A school that consolidates and uses funds from different Federal programs under this section shall not be required to maintain separate fiscal accounting records, by program, that identify the specific activities supported by those particular funds as long as the school maintains records that demonstrate that the schoolwide program, considered as a whole, addresses the intent and purposes of each of the Federal programs that were consolidated to support the schoolwide program.  (4) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- Each school receiving funds under this part for any fiscal year shall devote sufficient resources to effectively carry out the activities described in subsection (b)(1)(D) in accordance with section 1119 for such fiscal year, except that a school may enter into a consortium with another school to carry out such activities.  (b) COMPONENTS OF A SCHOOLWIDE PROGRAM-(1) IN GENERAL- A schoolwide program shall include the following components:  (A) A comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school (including taking into account the needs of migratory children as defined in section 1309(2)) that is based on information which includes the achievement of children in relation to the State academic content standards and the State student academic achievement standards described in section 1111(b)(1).  (B) Schoolwide reform strategies that     (i) provide opportunities for all children to meet the State's proficient and advanced levels of student academic achievement described in section 1111(b)(1)(D); (ii) use effective methods and instructional strategies that are based on scientifically based research that     (I) strengthen the core academic program in the school;  (II) increase the amount and quality of learning time, such as providing an extended school year and before- and after-school and summer programs and opportunities, and help provide an enriched and accelerated curriculum; and (III) include strategies for meeting the educational needs of historically underserved populations; (iii)(I) include strategies to address the needs of all children in the school, but particularly the needs of low-achieving children and those at risk of not meeting the State student academic achievement standards who are members of the target population of any program that is included in the schoolwide program, which may include     (aa) counseling, pupil services, and mentoring services; (bb) college and career awareness and preparation, such as college and career guidance, personal finance education, and innovative teaching methods, which may include applied learning and team-teaching strategies; and (cc) the integration of vocational and technical education programs; and (II) address how the school will determine if such needs have been met; and (iv) are consistent with, and are designed to implement, the State and local improvement plans, if any.  (C) Instruction by highly qualified teachers.  (D) In accordance with section 1119 and subsection (a)(4), high-quality and ongoing professional development for teachers, principals, and paraprofessionals and, if appropriate, pupil services personnel, parents, and other staff to enable all children in the school to meet the State's student academic achievement standards.  (E) Strategies to attract high-quality highly qualified teachers to high-need schools.  (F) Strategies to increase parental involvement in accordance with section 1118, such as family literary services.  (G) Plans for assisting preschool children in the transition from early childhood programs, such as Head Start, Even Start, Early Reading First, or a State-run preschool program, to local elementary school programs.  (H) Measures to include teachers in the decisions regarding the use of academic assessments described in section 1111(b)(3) in order to provide information on, and to improve, the achievement of individual students and the overall instructional program.  (I) Activities to ensure that students who experience difficulty mastering the proficient or advanced levels of academic achievement standards required by section 1111(b)(1) shall be provided with effective, timely additional assistance which shall include measures to ensure that students' difficulties are identified on a timely basis and to provide sufficient information on which to base effective assistance.  (J) Coordination and integration of Federal, State, and local services and programs, including programs supported under this Act, violence prevention programs, nutrition programs, housing programs, Head Start, adult education, vocational and technical education, and job training.  </p>
