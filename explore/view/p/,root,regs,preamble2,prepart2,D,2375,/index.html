Statement of special education and related services (Sec. 300.320(a)(4))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended requiring the regular education teacher to offer modifications for every assignment given to a child with a disability.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It would be inconsistent with the Act to implement the commenter's recommendation.  Consistent with Sec. 300.320(a)(4) and section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act, the child's IEP Team determines the special education and related services, and supplementary aids, services, and other supports that are needed for the child to advance appropriately toward meeting the child's annual goals.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A significant number of commenters recommended the regulations include a definition of "peer-reviewed research," as used in Sec. 300.320(a)(4).  One commenter recommended that the definition of peer-reviewed research be consistent with the work of the National Research Council.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  "Peer-reviewed research" generally refers to research that is reviewed by qualified and independent reviewers to ensure that the quality of the information meets the standards of the field before the research is published.  However, there is no single definition of "peer reviewed research" because the review process varies depending on the type of information to be reviewed.  We believe it is beyond the scope of these regulations to include a specific definition of "peer-reviewed research" and the various processes used for peer reviews.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.320(a)(4) to require special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services, to be based on "evidenced-based practices" rather than "peer-reviewed research."  A few commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.320(a)(4) to require special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services to be based on peer-reviewed research, evidenced-based practices, and emerging best practices.  Many commenters recommended clarifying the meaning and intent of the phrase "to the extent practicable."  One commenter recommended requiring all IEP Team meetings to include a focused discussion on research-based methods and to provide parents with prior written notice when the IEP Team refuses to provide documentation of research-based methods.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(4) incorporates the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act, which requires that special education and related services and supplementary aids and services be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.  The Act does not refer to "evidenced-based practices" or "emerging best practices," which are generally terms of art that may or may not be based on peer-reviewed research.  Therefore, we decline to change Sec. 300.320(a)(4) in the manner suggested by the commenters.  The phrase "to the extent practicable," as used this context, generally means that services and supports should be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent that it is possible, given the availability of peer-reviewed research.  We do not believe further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We decline to require all IEP Team meetings to include a focused discussion on research-based methods or require public agencies to provide prior written notice when an IEP Team refuses to provide documentation of research-based methods, as we believe such requirements are unnecessary and would be overly burdensome.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clear guidance on the responsibilities of States, school districts, and school personnel to provide special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are based on peer-reviewed research.  One commenter requested clarification that the requirement for special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services to be based on peer-reviewed research does not mean that the service with the greatest body of research is the service necessarily required for FAPE.  Another commenter requested that the regulations clarify that the failure of a public agency to provide special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services based on peer-reviewed research, does not result in a denial of FAPE, and that the burden of proof is on the moving party when the denial of FAPE is at issue.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act requires special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services, to be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.  States, school districts, and school personnel must, therefore, select and use methods that research has shown to be effective, to the extent that methods based on peer-reviewed research are available.  This does not mean that the service with the greatest body of research is the service necessarily required for a child to receive FAPE.  Likewise, there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the failure of a public agency to provide services based on peer-reviewed research would automatically result in a denial of FAPE.  The final decision about the special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are to be provided to a child must be made by the child's IEP Team based on the child's individual needs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
With regard to the comment regarding the burden of proof when the denial of FAPE is at issue, we have addressed this issue in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart E.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended including a construction clause in the regulations to clarify that no child should be denied special education and related services, or supplementary aids and services, based on a lack of available peer-reviewed research on a particular service to be provided.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the recommended construction clause is necessary.  Special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services based on peer-reviewed research are only required "to the extent practicable."  If no such research exists, the service may still be provided, if the IEP Team determines that such services are appropriate.  A child with a disability is entitled to the services that are in his or her IEP whether or not they are based on peer-reviewed research.  The IEP Team, which includes the child's parent, determines the special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services that are needed by the child to receive FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that the reference to "peer-reviewed research" does not require an IEP to include instructional methodologies.  However, a few commenters recommended that the regulations require all elements of a program provided to a child, including program methodology, to be specified in the child's IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that requires an IEP to include specific instructional methodologies.  Therefore, consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, we cannot interpret section 614 of the Act to require that all elements of a program provided to a child be included in an IEP.  The Department's longstanding position on including instructional methodologies in a child's IEP is that it is an IEP Team's decision.  Therefore, if an IEP Team determines that specific instructional methods are necessary for the child to receive FAPE, the instructional methods may be addressed in the IEP. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested that the regulations require programs provided to a child with a disability to be research-based with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  While the Act clearly places an emphasis on practices that are based on scientific research, there is nothing in the Act that requires all programs provided to children with disabilities to be research-based with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child where not practicable.  We do not believe the recommended change should be made because, ultimately, it is the child's IEP Team that determines the special education and related services that are needed by the child in order for the child to receive FAPE.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that Sec. 300.320(a)(4) specifically refer to assistive technology devices as supplementary aids that must be provided to the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to refer to assistive technology devices in Sec. 300.320(a)(4).  Section 300.324(a)(2)(v), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(B)(v) of the Act, already requires the IEP Team to consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p></p>
