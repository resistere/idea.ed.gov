State monitoring and enforcement (Sec. 300.600)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended modifying Sec. 300.600 to include language from section 616(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Act to clarify that the Department, like the States, has the authority and obligation to monitor and enforce Part B of the Act.  The commenters recommended that the requirements in section 616(a)(1) of the Act be included in the regulations because improving accountability is one of the most important goals of this reauthorization and the Act mandates the Secretary to monitor and enforce the Act. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We take the responsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with the Act seriously, but that responsibility comes from the Act, and from the Department's inherent authority to ensure that the laws it is charged with implementing are carried out, and not from these regulations.  In general, we do not believe that it is necessary to include language on the responsibility of the Secretary in the regulations, as, under Sec. 300.2, the regulations apply to States that receive payments under Part B of the Act and public agencies of those States, but not to the Department.  Information on our monitoring and enforcement activities is available on the Department's Web site at:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that the monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act should be included in Sec. 300.600.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act related to State responsibilities should be included in the regulations because these provisions require each State to monitor its LEAs in each of the monitoring priority areas specified in the Act.  Accordingly, we will add further clarification regarding the monitoring priority areas from section 616(a)(3) of the Act in Sec. 300.600. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  A new paragraph (d) has been added to Sec. 300.600 to include the State monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that there will be no accountability on the part of States and the Department for complying with the requirements in section 616(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Act because the regulations do not reflect these requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requirements in section 616(a)(1) of the Act, relating to a State's monitoring responsibilities, are included in the regulations in Sec. 300.600(a).  Further, as indicated in the response to the previous comment, a provision regarding the State's responsibility to monitor LEAs located in the State using the indicators in the monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act has been added in new Sec. 300.600(d).  Regarding the Secretary's monitoring responsibility, section 616(a)(1) of the Act is clear that the Secretary must monitor implementation of Part B of the Act through the oversight of States' exercise of general supervision and through the State performance plans.  Sections 616(a)(3) and 616(b) further describe the Secretary's responsibilities to monitor States' implementation of Part B of the Act.  In addition, note 253-258 of the Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 232, provides that the Secretary must request such information from States and stakeholders as is necessary to implement the purposes of the Act, including the use of on-site monitoring visits and file reviews to enforce the requirements of the Act.  We continue to believe it is unnecessary to include the Secretary's obligations in the regulations.  We also do not believe further clarification regarding State accountability is necessary in Sec. 300.600.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter noted that Sec. 300.600(c) requires States to use quantifiable indicators and such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance in the monitoring priority areas identified in section 616(a)(3) of the Act.  The commenter expressed concern that this requirement expands the data collection burden on States and focuses on inputs, processes, and whether certain procedural rights are met, rather than focusing on educational results and outcomes for children with disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.600 reflects the requirements in the Act and Congress' determination that collection of this data is necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Act.  Specifically, section 616(b)(2) of the Act requires each State to develop a State performance plan that includes measurable and rigorous targets for the indicators established under the monitoring priority areas.  As directed by section 616(a)(3) of the Act, the Secretary also has established quantifiable indicators in each of the monitoring priority areas listed in the Act and these regulations.  These indicators focus on improving educational results and functional outcomes for children with disabilities, and include issues such as the provision of services in the LRE, participation and performance on Statewide assessments, and graduation and dropout rates.  In addition, important systemic indicators, such as monitoring, mediation, and child find, are included.  More information about State performance plans, the indicators, and the Department's review of the State performance plans is available on the Department's Web site at:  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/bapr/index.html.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended changing Sec. 300.600 to require States to develop policies and procedures to analyze the performance of each public agency; develop written policies and procedures to guide monitoring activities; and develop and maintain a stakeholder group, which would include public school administrators, advocates, family members, and others, to guide monitoring and enforcement activities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.149(b), consistent with section 612(a)(11) of the Act, already requires States to have policies and procedures in effect to ensure compliance with the monitoring and enforcement requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.602 and Sec. Sec. 300.606 through 300.608.  Sections 300.167 through 300.169, consistent with section 612(a)(21) of the Act, require States to establish and maintain an advisory panel with broad and diverse representation to advise States on, among other things, developing evaluations and corrective action plans to address findings identified in Federal monitoring reports.  Accordingly, we do not believe any modification of Sec. 300.600, regarding State monitoring procedures, is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended modifying Sec. 300.600 to require States to establish a committee, which includes advocates to oversee monitoring and enforcement activities.  A number of commenters suggested that this group, at a minimum, include representatives of PTIs; protection and advocacy groups; and parent, disability advocacy, and education organizations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Several commenters also recommended requiring the advisory committee to provide advice on the development of the State's performance goals and indicators required in Sec. 300.157, the State's performance plan, including measurable and rigorous targets required in Sec. 300.601(a)(1) and (a)(3), the State's report to the public required in Sec. 300.602(b)(2), the State's corrective action or improvement plan under Sec. 300.604(b)(2)(i), and other State monitoring, improvement, and enforcement activities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The State advisory panel, required in Sec. Sec. 300.167 through 300.169, consistent with section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, addresses many of the commenters' suggestions.  The purpose of the State advisory panel, as stated in Sec. 300.167 and section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, is to provide policy guidance to the SEA with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.168 and section 612(a)(21)(B) of the Act, a broad membership is required.  The duties of the panel are, among other things, to advise the SEA on unmet needs, evaluations, and corrective action plans to address findings identified in Federal monitoring reports, consistent with Sec. 300.169 and section 612(a)(21)(D) of the Act.  However, although we believe that broad stakeholder involvement in the development of the State performance plans and annual performance reports is very important, we decline to regulate that a specific group be involved in their development.  We have, however, provided guidance in OSEP's August 9, 2005 memorandum to States, Submission of Part B State Performance Plans and Annual Performance Reports, (OSEP Memo 05-12), located at http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/bapr/index.html, which directs States to provide information in their State performance plans on how they obtained broad input from stakeholders on the State performance plan.  Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to add any further clarification in Sec. 300.600.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended modifying Sec. 300.600(b)(2) to clarify that monitoring and enforcement activities also apply to programs under Part C of the Act.  A few commenters suggested clarifying that Part C of the Act should be monitored to evaluate how well it serves infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.600 applies only to Part B of the Act.  However, the commenters are correct that the monitoring and enforcement activities in section 616 of the Act also apply to Part C of the Act, as provided in section 642 of the Act.  The Department will address this recommendation in the promulgation of regulations implementing Part C of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying that the monitoring priority in section 616(a)(3)(A) of the Act, relating to the provision of FAPE in the LRE, should be based on the unique needs of the individual child.  One commenter stated that the regulations should stress individualization when determining LRE.  This commenter recommended including language from note 89 of the Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 186, which highlights Congress' intent that each public agency ensure that a "continuum of alternative placements (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions) is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services." </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.115, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, requires each public agency to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements (including instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions) is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services.  The LRE provisions are intended to ensure that a child with a disability is served in a setting where the child can be educated successfully and that placement decisions are individually determined based on each child's abilities and needs.  We do not believe that the change recommended by the commenter is needed.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended changing Sec. 300.600 to specify that the Department's monitoring of States for compliance with the LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.117 include a review of IEPs to determine if:  (1) placements were based on the individual unique needs of each child; (2) placements were requested by parents; (3) IEP Teams followed the IEP requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.328; (4) children received the services required to participate and progress in the general curriculum; (5) children are in appropriate environments; and (6) the educational and emotional advancements of children were considered.  The commenter recommended adding language to direct individuals who monitor the implementation of the Act to look further than "numbers" when monitoring the LRE requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As noted in section 616(a)(1) of the Act, the Secretary monitors implementation of the Act through oversight of States' exercise of general supervision and States' performance plans.  Section 616(a)(1) of the Act further states that the Secretary requires States to monitor and enforce the implementation of the Act by LEAs.  The activities listed by the commenter are not the type of monitoring activities the Act requires the Secretary to undertake.  The commenter's listed activities are more appropriately the responsibilities of States as they monitor the implementation of the Act in their LEAs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended avoiding references to the Act in Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.609 when references to the regulations could accomplish the same result.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter and will revise Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.609 accordingly.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have revised Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.609 by replacing statutory citations with relevant regulatory citations, where appropriate. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that racial disproportionality in educational placements falls within the monitoring priority areas for monitoring and enforcement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.600(d), consistent with section 616(a)(3) of the Act, includes disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services (to the extent the representation is the result of inappropriate identification) as a monitoring priority.  Because the monitoring priority area clearly refers to disproportionate representation to the extent the representation is a result of inappropriate identification of children with disabilities, and not placement, we do not believe we can include disproportionate representation resulting from educational placement within the scope of this monitoring priority area.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended including a requirement in Sec. 300.600(c) that States develop corrective action plans for each LEA monitored to improve performance in the monitoring priority areas.  The commenter also suggested requiring that corrective action plans be completed by the State within one year of the monitoring report. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.600(a), consistent with section 616(a)(1)(C) of the Act, requires States to monitor implementation and enforcement of the Act.  As discussed elsewhere in this section in response to comments regarding Sec. 300.604 (Enforcement), we have revised Sec. 300.600(a) to identify the specific enforcement actions included in Sec. 300.604 that are appropriate for States to use with LEAs.  The new Sec. 300.600(a) identifies specific methods that must be used to ensure correction when an LEA has been determined to need assistance for two consecutive years or to need intervention for three or more consecutive years.  For example, Sec. 300.600(a) refers to Sec. 300.604(b)(2)(i), which discusses the preparation of a corrective action or improvement plan.  In addition, new Sec. 300.608(b) clarifies that States can use other authority available to them to monitor and enforce the Act.  States need the flexibility to select the most appropriate mechanism to ensure correction in a timely manner.  Requiring that corrective action plans be developed in every instance is overly prescriptive when there are multiple methods that can be used.  Accordingly, we do not think it is necessary to make the change suggested by the commenter.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
