Bush. The provisions of the act became effective on   July 1, 2005, with the exception of some of the elements   pertaining to the definition of a &ldquo;highly qualified   teacher&rdquo; that took effect upon the signing of the act. The   final regulations were published on Aug. 14, 2006. This is one in   a series of documents, prepared by the Office of Special   Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) in the U.S.   Department of Education that covers a variety of high-interest   topics and brings together the regulatory requirements related to   those topics to support constituents in preparing to implement   the new regulations.<sup>1</sup> This document addresses   significant changes from preexisting regulations to the final   regulatory requirements regarding the identification of specific   learning disabilities.<br />   <br />   <strong><em>IDEA</em> Regulations</strong><br />   <br />   <strong>1. Add procedures for identifying children with specific   learning disabilities.</strong><br />   <br />   A State must adopt, consistent with 34 CFR 300.309, criteria for   determining whether a child has a specific learning disability as   defined in 34 CFR 300.8(c)(10). In addition, the criteria adopted   by the State:<br />    <ul>     <li>Must not require the use of a severe discrepancy between     intellectual ability and achievement for determining whether a     child has a specific learning disability, as defined in 34 CFR     300.8(c)(10);</li>      <li>Must permit the use of a process based on the child&rsquo;s     response to scientific, research-based intervention; and</li>      <li>May permit the use of other alternative research-based     procedures for determining whether a child has a specific     learning disability, as defined in 34 CFR     300.8(c)(10).<br /></li>   </ul>A public agency must use the State criteria adopted pursuant   to 34 CFR 300.307(a) in determining whether a child has a   specific learning disability.<br />   [34 CFR 300.307] [20 U.S.C. 1221e-3; 1401(30); 1414(b)(6)]<br />   <br />   <strong>2. Require additional group members.</strong><br />   <br />   The determination of whether a child suspected of having a   specific learning disability is a child with a disability as   defined in 34 CFR 300.8, must be made by the child&rsquo;s   parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must   include:<br />    <ul>     <li>The child&rsquo;s regular teacher; or if the child does not     have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified     to teach a child of his or her age; or for a child of less than     school age, an individual qualified by the State educational     agency (SEA) to teach a child of his or her age; and</li>      <li>At least one person qualified to conduct individual     diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school     psychologist, speech-language pathologist, or remedial reading     teacher.<br /></li>   </ul>    <div class="c2">     [34 CFR 300.308] [20 U.S.C. 1221e-3; 1401(30); 1414(b)(6)]<br />     <br />     <strong>3. Add criteria for determining the existence of a     specific learning disability.</strong><br />     <br />     The group described in 34 CFR 300.306 may determine that a     child has a specific learning disability, as defined in 34 CFR     300.8(c)(10), if:   </div>    <div>     <ul>       <li>The child does not achieve adequately for the       child&rsquo;s age or to meet State-approved grade-level       standards in one or more of the following areas, when       provided with learning experiences and instruction       appropriate for the child&rsquo;s age or State-approved       grade&ndash;level standards:</li>        <li class="c3">         <ul>           <li>Oral expression.</li>            <li>Listening comprehension.</li>            <li>Written expression.</li>            <li>Basic reading skills.</li>            <li>Reading fluency skills.</li>            <li>Reading comprehension.</li>            <li>Mathematics calculation.</li>            <li>Mathematics problem solving.</li>         </ul>       </li>     </ul>      <ul>       <li>The child does not make sufficient progress to meet age       or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the       areas identified in 34 CFR 300.309(a)(1) when using a process       based on the child&rsquo;s response to scientific,       research-based intervention; or the child exhibits a pattern       of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or       both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards,       or intellectual development, that is determined by the group       to be relevant to the identification of a specific learning       disability, using appropriate assessments, consistent with 34       CFR 300.304 and 300.305; and the group determines that its       findings under 34 CFR 300.309(a)(1) and (2) are not primarily       the result of:</li>        <li class="c3">         <ul>           <li>A visual, hearing, or motor disability;</li>            <li>Mental retardation;</li>            <li>Emotional disturbance;</li>            <li>Cultural factors;</li>            <li>Environmental or economic disadvantage; or</li>            <li>Limited English proficiency.<br /></li>         </ul>       </li>     </ul><br />     To ensure that underachievement in a child suspected of having     a specific learning disability is not due to lack of     appropriate instruction in reading or math, the group must     consider, as part of the evaluation described in 34 CFR 300.304     through 300.306:<br />      <ul>       <li>Data that demonstrate that prior to, or as a part of, the       referral process, the child was provided appropriate       instruction in regular education settings, delivered by       qualified personnel; and</li>        <li>Data-based documentation of repeated assessments of       achievement at reasonable intervals, reflecting formal       assessment of student progress during instruction, which was       provided to the child&rsquo;s parents.<br /></li>     </ul>The public agency must promptly request parental consent     to evaluate the child to determine if the child needs special     education and related services, and must adhere to the     timeframes described in 34 CFR 300.301 and 300.303, unless     extended by mutual written agreement of the child&rsquo;s     parents and a group of qualified professionals, as described in     34 CFR 300.306(a)(1):<br />      <ul>       <li>If, prior to a referral, a child has not made adequate       progress after an appropriate period of time when provided       instruction, as described in 34 CFR 300.309(b)(1) and (b)(2);       and</li>        <li>Whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.<br /></li>     </ul>[34 CFR 300.309] [20 U.S.C. 1221e-3; 1401(30);     1414(b)(6)]<br />     <br />     <strong>4. Describe the required observation.</strong><br />     <br />     The public agency must ensure that the child is observed in the     child&rsquo;s learning environment (including the regular     classroom setting) to document the child&rsquo;s academic     performance and behavior in the areas of difficulty.<br />     <br />     The group described in 34 CFR 300.306(a)(1), in determining     whether a child has a specific learning disability, must decide     to:<br />      <ul>       <li>Use information from an observation in routine classroom       instruction and monitoring of the child&rsquo;s performance       that was done before the child was referred for an       evaluation; or</li>        <li>Have at least one member of the group described in 34 CFR       300.306(a)(1) conduct an observation of the child&rsquo;s       academic performance in the regular classroom after the child       has been referred for an evaluation and parental consent,       consistent with 34 CFR 300.300(a), is obtained.<br /></li>     </ul>In the case of a child of less than school age or out of     school, a group member must observe the child in an environment     appropriate for a child of that age.<br />     [34 CFR 300.310] [20 U.S.C. 1221e-3; 1401(30); 1414(b)(6)]<br />     <br />     <strong>5. Specify documentation required for the eligibility     determination.</strong><br />     <br />     For a child suspected of having a specific learning disability,     the documentation of the determination of eligibility, as     required in 34 CFR 300.306(a)(2), must contain a statement     of:<br />      <ul>       <li>         <div class="c2">           Whether the child has a specific learning disability;         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           The basis for making the determination, including an           assurance that the determination has been made in           accordance with 34 CFR 300.306(c)(1);         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           The relevant behavior, if any, noted during the           observation of the child and the relationship of that           behavior to the child&rsquo;s academic functioning;         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           The educationally relevant medical findings, if any;         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           Whether the child does not achieve adequately for the           child&rsquo;s age or to meet State-approved grade-level           standards consistent with 34 CFR 300.309(a)(1); and the           child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or           State-approved grade-level standards consistent with 34           CFR 300.309(a)(2)(i); or the child exhibits a pattern of           strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or           both, relative to age, State-approved grade level           standards or intellectual development consistent with 34           CFR 300.309(a)(2)(i); or the child exhibits a pattern of           strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or           both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level           standards or intellectual development consistent with 34           CFR 300.309(a)(2)(ii);         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           The determination of the group concerning the effects of           a visual, hearing, or motor disability; mental           retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors;           environmental or economic disadvantage; or limited           English proficiency on the child&rsquo;s achievement           level; and         </div>       </li>        <li>         <div class="c2">           If the child has participated in a process that assesses           the child&rsquo;s response to scientific, research-based           intervention:         </div>       </li>        <li class="c3">         <ul>           <li>The instructional strategies used and the           student-centered data collected; and<br /></li>            <li>The documentation that the child&rsquo;s parents were           notified about: (1) the State&rsquo;s policies regarding           the amount and nature of student performance data that           would be collected and the general education services           that would be provided; (2) strategies for increasing the           child&rsquo;s rate of learning; and (3) the           parents&rsquo; right to request an evaluation.<br /></li>         </ul>       </li>     </ul>Each group member must certify in writing whether the     report reflects the member&rsquo;s conclusion.
