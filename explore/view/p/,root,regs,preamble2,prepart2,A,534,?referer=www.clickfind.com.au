Exception; services that apply to children with cochlear implants (Sec. 300.34(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters opposed the exclusion of surgically implanted devices from the definition of related services.  Many commenters stated that the Act does not exclude the maintenance or programming of surgically implanted devices from the definition of related services, and that the regulations should specifically state that related services includes the provision of mapping services for a child with a cochlear implant.  A few commenters stated that the issue of mapping cochlear implants needs to be clarified so that schools and parents understand who is responsible for providing this service.  One commenter requested that the regulations clearly specify that optimization of a cochlear implant is a medical service and define mapping as an audiological service.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.  We will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a cochlear implant is an example of device optimization and is not a related service under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added "(e.g., mapping)" following "functioning" in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a surgically implanted device is not a related service under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A significant number of commenters stated that children with cochlear implants need instruction in listening and language skills to process spoken language, just as children with hearing loss who use hearing aids, and requested that the regulations clarify that excluding the optimization of device functioning from the definition of related services does not impact a child's access to related services such as speech and language therapy, assistive listening devices, appropriate classroom acoustics, auditory training, educational interpreters, cued speech transliterators, and specialized instruction.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter requested that the regulations explicitly state whether a public agency is required to provide more speech and language services or audiology services to a child with a cochlear implant.  Another commenter requested that the regulations clarify that optimization only refers to access to assistive technology, such as assistive listening devices (e.g., personal frequency modulation (FM) systems) and monitoring and troubleshooting of the device function that is required under proper functioning of hearing aids. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have reformatted Sec. 300.34(b) and added a new paragraph (2) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted device is entitled to the related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be required for the child to benefit from special education.  We have also added the phrase "services that apply to children with surgically implanted devices, including cochlear implants" to the heading in Sec. 300.34(b).  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that excluding the optimization of device functioning and maintenance of the device as related services will establish different standards for serving children with cochlear implants versus children who use hearing aids and other external amplification devices, and recommended clarifying that routine monitoring of cochlear implants and other surgically implanted devices to ensure that they are functioning in a safe and effective manner is permitted under the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters stated that some schools are interpreting the exclusion of device optimization, functioning, and maintenance to mean that they do not have to help the child change a battery in the externally worn speech processor connected with the surgically implanted device, make certain that it is turned on, or help the child to learn to listen with the cochlear implant.  One commenter stated that children with cochlear implants should have the same services as children who use a hearing aid when the battery needs changing or equipment breaks down.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter stated that Sec. 300.34(b) is confusing and should explicitly state that the exception of the optimization of device functioning, maintenance of the device, or replacement of the device is limited to surgically implanted devices.  The commenter stated that the language could erroneously lead to an interpretation that this exception is applicable to all medical devices.  One commenter expressed concern that this misinterpretation could put insulin pumps and other medical devices that are required for the health of the child in the same category as cochlear implants.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters stated that it is important to clarify that excluding the optimization of device functioning and the maintenance of the device should not be construed to exclude medical devices and services that children need to assist with breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions while the child is involved with education and other school-related activities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	One commenter stated that a school nurse, aide, teacher's aide, or any other person who is qualified and trained should be allowed to monitor and maintain, as necessary, a surgically implanted device.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  A cochlear implant is an electronic device surgically implanted to stimulate nerve endings in the inner ear (cochlea) in order to receive and process sound and speech.  The device has two parts, one that is surgically implanted and attached to the skull and, the second, an externally worn speech processor that attaches to a port in the implant.  The internal device is intended to be permanent.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Optimization or "mapping" adjusts or fine tunes the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant and is changed as a child learns to discriminate signals to a finer degree.  Optimization services are generally provided at a specialized clinic.  As we discussed previously regarding Sec. 300.34, optimization services are not a covered service under the Act.  However, a public agency still has a role in providing services and supports to help children with cochlear implants.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Particularly with younger children or children who have recently obtained implants, teachers and related services personnel frequently are the first to notice changes in the child's perception of sounds that the child may be missing.  This may manifest as a lack of attention or understanding on the part of the child or frustration in communicating.  The changes may indicate a need for remapping, and we would expect that school personnel would communicate with the child's parents about these issues.  To the extent that adjustments to the devices are required, a specially trained professional would provide the remapping, which is not considered the responsibility of the public agency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In many ways, there is no substantive difference between serving a child with a cochlear implant in a school setting and serving a child with a hearing aid.  The externally worn speech processor connected with the surgically implanted device is similar to a hearing aid in that it must be turned on and properly functioning in order for the child to benefit from his or her education.  Parents of children with cochlear implants and parents of children with hearing aids both frequently bring to school extra batteries, cords, and other parts for the hearing aids and externally worn speech processors connected with the surgically-implanted devices, especially for younger children.  The child also may need to be positioned so that he or she can directly see the teacher at all times, or may need an FM amplification system such as an audio loop.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
For services that are not necessary to provide access to education by maintaining the health or safety of the child while in school, the distinguishing factor between those services that are not covered under the Act, such as mapping, and those that are covered, such as verifying that a cochlear implant is functioning properly, in large measure, is the level of expertise required.  The maintenance and monitoring of surgically implanted devices require the expertise of a licensed physician or an individual with specialized technical expertise beyond that typically available from school personnel.  On the other hand, trained lay persons or nurses can routinely check an externally worn processor connected with a surgically implanted device to determine if the batteries are charged and the external processor is operating.  (As discussed below, the Act does require public agencies to provide those services that are otherwise related services and are necessary to maintain a child's health or safety in school even if those services require specialized training.)  Teachers and related services providers can be taught to first check the externally worn speech processor to make sure it is turned on, the volume and sensitivity settings are correct, and the cable is connected, in much the same manner as they are taught to make sure a hearing aid is properly functioning.  To allow a child to sit in a classroom when the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant is not functioning is to effectively exclude the child from receiving an appropriate education.  Therefore, we believe it is important to clarify that a public agency is responsible for the routine checking of the external components of a surgically implanted device in much the same manner as a public agency is responsible for the proper functioning of hearing aids.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The public agency also is responsible for providing services necessary to maintain the health and safety of a child while the child is in school, with breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions (e.g., nursing services, suctioning a tracheotomy, urinary catheterization) if these services can be provided by someone who has been trained to provide the service and are not the type of services that can only be provided by a licensed physician.  (Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., 526 U.S. 66 (1999))</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added new Sec. 300.113 to cover the routine checking of hearing aids and external components of surgically implanted devices.  The requirement for the routine checking of hearing aids has been removed from proposed Sec. 300.105 and included in new Sec. 300.113(a).  The requirement for routine checking of an external component of a surgically implanted medical device has been added as new Sec. 300.113(b).  The requirements for assistive technology devices and services remain in Sec. 300.105 and the heading has been changed to reflect this change.  We have also included a reference to new Sec. 300.113(b) in new Sec. 300.34(b)(2).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that specialized cochlear implant audiologists who are at implant centers or closely associated with them should program cochlear implants.  One commenter stated that, typically, school audiologists and school personnel do not have the specialized experience to program cochlear implants.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The personnel with the specific expertise or licensure required for the optimization (e.g., mapping) of surgically implanted devices are decisions to be made within each State based on applicable State statutes and licensing requirements.  Since mapping is not covered under the Act, personnel standards for individuals who provide mapping services are beyond the scope of these regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
