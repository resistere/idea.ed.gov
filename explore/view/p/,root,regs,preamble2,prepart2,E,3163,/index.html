Resolution period (Sec. 300.510(b))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter noted that Sec. 300.510(b)(1) states that if an LEA has not resolved a due process complaint within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint, the due process hearing "must" occur, which is inconsistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, which states that the due process hearing "may" occur.  However, another commenter recommended retaining the language in Sec. 300.510(b), in lieu of the permissive statutory language.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.510(b)(1) should be changed to be consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.  A requirement that a due process hearing must occur when the resolution period is not successful in resolving the underlying dispute could prove unduly restrictive for the parties, particularly in situations where the parties agree to an extension of the resolution period or reach a settlement after the resolution period has expired.  Therefore, we are changing Sec. 300.510(b)(1) to state that a due process hearing "may" occur if the parties have not resolved the dispute that formed the basis for the due process complaint by the end of the resolution period.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.510(b)(1) has been changed by removing the word "must" and replacing it with "may" prior to the word "occur" to reflect the language in section 615(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended requiring LEAs to waive the resolution period when a parent can show that, prior to the filing of the complaint, the LEA had specific knowledge of the facts later identified in the complaint and had a reasonable time to resolve the issue, or did not notify the parent within five days of the resolution meeting or inform the parent of their options.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides two occasions when a resolution meeting need not occur:  (1) when the parent and LEA agree in writing to waive the meeting; and (2) when the parent and LEA agree to use the mediation process in Sec. 300.506.  There are no provisions that allow a parent or an LEA to unilaterally waive the resolution meeting.  In the circumstances mentioned by the commenter, the resolution meeting still is a required vehicle for the parent and the LEA to attempt to resolve their differences prior to initiating a due process hearing.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  We received numerous comments expressing concern about the resolution process and requesting changes to the regulations to ensure that the resolution process is used effectively to resolve disputes and not to delay or deny the right to a due process hearing.  Some commenters requested that Sec. 300.510(b)(3) be removed because it allows a public agency to delay the due process hearing by scheduling resolution meetings at times or places that are inconvenient for the parent.  Many commenters recommended that if an LEA fails to convene a resolution meeting within the required 15 days, bring the required personnel to a resolution meeting, or participate in a resolution meeting in good faith, the 45-day timeline for a hearing decision should begin on the date that the due process complaint notice was filed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters requested clarification on what is considered "participation" or "good faith" participation in a resolution meeting and who decides if participation has occurred.  A number of commenters recommended that the regulations permit a hearing officer to determine whether a parent or LEA has participated in the resolution meeting and whether the due process hearing can proceed.  Another commenter requested clarification on when the 45-day timeline for a due process hearing begins when a hearing officer determines that a parent has participated.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Several commenters asked how long a due process complaint remains open if the parent does not participate during the 30-day resolution period.  A number of commenters requested clarification as to whether and how an LEA can dismiss a due process complaint when a parent refuses to participate in a resolution meeting.  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify the consequences of indefinitely delaying a due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not agree that Sec. 300.510(b)(3) should be removed.  This provision is based on H. Rpt. No. 108-77, p. 114, that provides:</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
[If] the parent and the LEA mutually agree that the meeting does not need to occur, the resolution meeting does not need to take place.  However, unless such an agreement is reached, the failure of the party bringing the complaints to participate in the meeting will delay the timeline for convening a due process hearing until the meeting is held.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We fully expect that only in very rare situations will an LEA fail to meet its obligation to convene a resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, delay the due process hearing by scheduling meetings at times or places that are inconvenient for the parent, or otherwise not participate in good faith in the resolution process.  However, in instances of noncompliance, we believe parents should be able to request a hearing officer to allow the due process hearing to proceed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	In situations where an LEA convenes a meeting with the parent and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint, and the parent fails to participate in the resolution meeting, the LEA would need to continue to make diligent efforts throughout the remainder of the 30-day resolution period to convince the parent to participate in the resolution meeting.  If, however, at the end of the 30-day resolution period, the LEA is still unable to convince the parent to participate in the resolution meeting, we believe that an LEA should be able to seek intervention by a hearing officer to dismiss the complaint.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Therefore, we are adding language to the regulations to allow the parents to seek a hearing officer's intervention in cases where an LEA fails to convene a resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting.  We also are adding language to allow an LEA, at the conclusion of the 30-day resolution period, to request a hearing officer to dismiss a complaint when the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of a parent in a resolution meeting despite making reasonable efforts to do so during the 30-day resolution period.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(4) in Sec. 300.510 to allow an LEA, at the conclusion of the 30-day resolution period to seek the intervention of a hearing officer to dismiss the parent's complaint, if the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting, after reasonable efforts have been made.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We have also added a new paragraph (b)(5) to allow a parent to seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing, if the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters stated that the 45-day timeline for a due process hearing should begin when both parties agree that the complaint will not be resolved in a resolution meeting or mediation session.  Other commenters suggested that when a resolution meeting or mediation session is held and it is clear before the end of the 30-day resolution period that the LEA and the parent cannot resolve the dispute, the 45-day timeline should be allowed to begin prior to the end of the 30-day resolution period.  A few commenters requested further clarification regarding how the timeline is counted once the parent participates in a resolution meeting.  A few commenters recommended that the 45-day timeline for the hearing commence once both parties agree that the issue will not be resolved without a due process hearing.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require the waiver to be in writing so that hearing officers have a specific point in time to know when they should be counting the 45 days.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that the due process hearing should be allowed to proceed if the LEA and parent agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting.  We also believe that the due process hearing should be allowed to proceed when an LEA and the parent agree to waive the remainder of the 30-day resolution period when it becomes apparent that the LEA and the parent will be unable to reach agreement through resolution or mediation.  There may also be situations in which both parties agree to continue the mediation session beyond the 30-day resolution period.  Therefore, we are adding language to the regulations to clarify these exceptions to the 30-day resolution period.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	The new language specifies that the 45-day timeline for the due process hearing starts the day after one of the following events:  (a) both parties agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting; (b) after either the mediation or resolution meeting starts, but before the end of the 30-day resolution period, both parties agree in writing that no agreement is possible; and (c) if both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of the 30-day resolution period, but later the parent or public agency withdraws from the mediation process.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (c) in Sec. 300.510 that specifies adjustments to the 30-day resolution period.  Subsequent paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations require public agencies to document their attempts to ensure parent participation in resolution meetings, and to do so in the same manner that they are required to document their attempts to involve parents in IEP Team meetings. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenters and will add language to Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to make this clear.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added language in Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to require an LEA to use the same procedures it uses in Sec. 300.322(d) to document its efforts to obtain the participation of a parent in a resolution meeting.  We also have amended Sec. 300.510(b)(4) to refer to "due process complaints," for clarity.</p></p>
