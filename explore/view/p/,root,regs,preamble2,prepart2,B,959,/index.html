Children in Private Schools<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Children With Disabilities Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
General comments</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many comments were received regarding the parentally-placed private school children with disabilities requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144.  Many commenters supported the changes to the regulations and believed the regulations simplify the processes for both private schools and public schools. Numerous commenters, however, expressed concern regarding the implementation of the private school requirements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Many of the commenters expressed concern with the requirement that the LEAs where private elementary schools and secondary schools are located are now responsible for child find, individual evaluations, and the provision of services for children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools located in the LEA.  These commenters described the private school provisions in the Act and the NPRM as burdensome and difficult to understand.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The revisions to the Act in 2004 significantly changed the obligation of States and LEAs to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  Section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act now requires LEAs in which the private schools are located, rather than the LEAs in which the parents of such children reside, to conduct child find and provide equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Act provides that, in calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds under Part B of the Act that must be spent on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, the LEAs where the private schools are located, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private elementary schools and secondary schools and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, must conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEAs.  In addition, the obligation of the LEA to spend a proportionate amount of funds to provide services to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools is now based on the total number of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools located in the LEA whether or not the children and their parents reside in the LEA.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe these regulations and the additional clarification provided in our responses to comments on Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 will help States and LEAs to better understand their obligations in serving children with disabilities placed by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  In addition, the Department has provided additional guidance on implementing the parentally-placed private school requirements on the Department's Web site.  We also are including in these regulations Appendix B to Part 300-Proportionate Share Calculation to assist LEAs in calculating the proportionate amount of Part B funds that they must expend on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities attending private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a reference to Appendix B in Sec. 300.133(b).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 include requirements that go beyond the Act and recommended that any requirement beyond what is statutory be removed from these regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In general, the regulations track the language in section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act regarding children enrolled in private schools by their parents.  However, we determined that including clarification of the statutory language on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in these regulations would be helpful.  The volume of comments received concerning this topic confirm the need to regulate in order to clarify the statutory language and to help ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested that the regulations provide flexibility to States to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond what they would be able to do with the proportionate share required under the Act.  A few of these commenters requested that those States already providing an individual entitlement to special education and related services or providing a full range of special education services to parentally-placed private school children be deemed to have met the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 and be permitted to continue the State's current practices.  One commenter specifically recommended allowing States that provide additional rights or services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (including FAPE under section 612 of the Act and the procedural safeguards under section 615 of the Act), the option of requesting that the Secretary consider alternate compliance with these requirements that would include evidence and supporting documentation of alternate procedures under State law to meet all the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters requested that the child find and equitable participation requirements should not apply in States with dual enrollment provisions where children with disabilities who are parentally-placed in private elementary schools or secondary schools are also enrolled in public schools for special education and have IEPs and retain their due process rights.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act in no way prohibits States or LEAs from spending additional State or local funds to provide special education or related services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in excess of those required in Sec. 300.133 and section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, consistent with State law or administrative procedures.  The Act, however, does not provide the Secretary with the authority to waive, in whole or in part, the parentally-placed private school requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for States or LEAs that spend State or local funds to provide special education or related services beyond those required under Part B of the Act.  The Secretary, therefore, cannot consider alternative compliance with the parentally-placed private school provisions in the Act and these regulations or consider States and LEAs that use State and local funds to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond the required proportionate share of Federal Part B funds, including providing FAPE to such children, to have met the statutory and regulatory requirements governing parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  States and LEAs must meet the requirements in the Act and these regulations.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern regarding the applicability of the child find and equitable participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for children with disabilities who reside in one State and are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools located in another State.  These commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether the LEA in the State where the private elementary school or secondary school is located or the LEA in the State where the child resides is responsible for conducting child find (including individual evaluations and reevaluations), and providing and paying for equitable services for children who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act provides that the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, after timely and meaningful consultation with private school representatives, is responsible for conducting the child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA.  We believe this responsibility includes child find for children who reside in other States but who attend private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act is clear about which LEA is responsible for child find and the Act does not provide an exception for children who reside in one State and attend private elementary schools and secondary schools in other States.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, in consultation with private school officials and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, also is responsible for determining and paying for the services to be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  We believe this responsibility extends to children from other States who are enrolled in a private school located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act clarifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for spending a proportionate amount of its Federal Part B funds on special education and related services for children enrolled by their parents in the private schools located in the LEA.  The Act does not provide an exception for out-of-State children with disabilities attending a private school located in the LEA and, therefore, out-of-State children with disabilities must be included in the group of parentally-placed children with disabilities whose needs are considered in determining which parentally-placed private school children with disabilities will be served and the types and amounts of services to be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (f) to Sec. 300.131 clarifying that each LEA where private, including religious, elementary schools and secondary schools are located must, in carrying out the child find requirements in this section, include parentally-placed private school children who reside in the State other than where the private schools they attend are located.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended the regulations clarify the LEA's obligation under Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 regarding child find and equitable participation for children from other countries enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools by their parents.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The obligation to consider children with disabilities for equitable services extends to all children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled by their parents in private schools within each LEA's jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended the regulations clarify the applicability of the child find and equitable participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for children with disabilities, aged three through five, enrolled by their parents in private preschools or day care programs.  Many commenters recommended the regulations clarify that preschool children with disabilities should be counted in determining the proportionate share of funds available to serve children enrolled in private elementary schools by their parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a private preschool or day care program is considered an elementary school, as defined in Sec. 300.13, the child find and equitable services participation requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, consistent with section 612(a)(10) of the Act, apply to children with disabilities aged three through five enrolled by their parents in such programs.  Section 300.13, consistent with section 602(6) of the Act, defines an elementary school as a nonprofit institutional day or residential school, including a public elementary charter school, which provides elementary education, as determined under State law.  We believe it is important to clarify in the regulations that children aged three through five are considered parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools only if they are enrolled in private schools that meet the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new Sec. 300.133(a)(2)(ii) to clarify that children aged three through five are considered to be parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, including religious, elementary schools, if they are enrolled in a private school that meets the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13.</p></p>
