The amount         of such payment        for any fiscal year shall be 1.25 percent of the aggregate of         the amount available to all States under this part for such         fiscal year.

Such funds may also be used to provide early         intervention services in accordance with this part. Such         activities may be carried out directly or through contracts or         cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, local         educational agencies, and other public or private nonprofit         organizations.
