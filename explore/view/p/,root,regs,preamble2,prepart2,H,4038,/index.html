Manifestation determination review procedures<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  The purpose of the change in the law is to simplify the discipline process and make it easier for school officials to discipline children with disabilities when discipline is appropriate and justified.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Because fewer factors need to be considered during each manifestation determination review, the time required to conduct such reviews will likely be reduced, and some minimal savings may be realized.  However, the more significant impact relates to secondary effects.  Because it will be less burdensome for school personnel to conduct manifestation determinations, it is reasonable to expect an overall increase in the number of these reviews as school personnel take advantage of the streamlined process to pursue disciplinary actions against those children with disabilities who commit serious violations of student codes of conduct.  This prediction is consistent with a recent GAO report ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), which found that a "sizable minority of principals" voiced concern that discipline policies under previous law impeded proper disciplinary action for students with disabilities, and that some of these comments "may have stemmed from the additional time and resources that principals reportedly use to discipline special education students compared with regular education students."  Even more importantly, the changes in the law will make it easier for review team members to conclude that the behavior in question is not a manifestation of a child's disability, enabling school personnel to apply disciplinary sanctions in more cases involving children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We have minimal data on the number of manifestation determination reviews being conducted.  However, State-reported data for the 2002-2003 school year suggest that schools are conducting a relatively small number of manifestation reviews.  According to these data, for every 1,000 children with disabilities, approximately 11 will be suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days during the school year (either through a single suspension or as a result of multiple short-term suspensions)--the disciplinary action triggering a manifestation review.  (Please note that we have no way of accurately estimating what portion of short-term suspensions that add up to 10 days would be determined by school personnel to constitute a change in placement.  Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this analysis, that 100 percent of these instances would require a manifestation review because they would be deemed a change in placement).  Based on a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we assume that under previous law at least 85 percent of manifestation reviews resulted in disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspensions or expulsion).  In other words, approximately 15 percent of all manifestation reviews did not result in disciplinary action because the behavior in question was determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Without taking into consideration increases in the frequency of manifestation reviews, using suspension and expulsion data from previous years, we estimate that the total number of manifestation reviews in 2006-2007 will be approximately 87,880.  If we assume that the streamlining reflected in the regulations will produce a 20 percent increase in the total number of manifestation reviews, we predict that 17,576 additional meetings will occur, for a total of 105,456 meetings.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Under the final regulations, the Secretary also expects an increase in the total number of manifestation reviews resulting in disciplinary actions, but it is not likely to be a significant increase.  GAO's finding that there is little practical difference in how school personnel disciplined regular and special education students under previous law suggests that manifestation reviews are already highly likely to result in disciplinary actions.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
The Secretary concludes that the final regulations will generate some minimal savings from the reduction in time required to conduct the manifestation reviews.  Schools would also realize some qualitative benefits related to the increased likelihood that the outcome of the review will result in disciplinary action, thereby fostering a school environment that is safer, more orderly, and more conducive to learning.  The Secretary acknowledges that the final regulations could create additional costs for parents of children who, but for this change, would not have been subject to disciplinary removals, to the extent that such parents disagree with the manifestation determination and choose to appeal it.  On balance, the Secretary believes that the benefits likely to result from this change relating to school safety and order outweigh the costs to families.</p></p>
