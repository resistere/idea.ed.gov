Where significant disproportionality is occurring, the State must provide for the review, and, if appropriate, revision of policies, procedures, and practices used in identification, placement, or discipline to ensure that they comply with the requirements of IDEA; require the LEA to publicly report on the revision of policies, practices, and procedures; and require the LEA to reserve 15 percent of its Part B funds to provide comprehensive coordinated early intervening services to serve children in the LEA, particularly, but not exclusively, children in those groups that were significantly over-identified.<br /><br />Generally, the questions, and corresponding answers, presented in this Q&amp;A document required interpretation of IDEA and its implementing regulations and the answers are not simply a restatement of the statutory or regulatory requirements.&nbsp; The responses presented in this document generally are informal guidance representing the interpretation of the Department of the applicable statutory or regulatory requirements in the context of the specific facts presented and are not legally binding.&nbsp; The Q&amp;As in this document are not intended to be a replacement for careful study of IDEA and its implementing regulations.&nbsp; IDEA, its implementing regulations, and other important documents related to IDEA and the regulations are found at http://idea.ed.gov.<br /><br />If you are interested in commenting on this guidance, please email your comments to OSERSguidancecomments@ed.gov and include Disproportionality in the subject of your email or write us at the following address:&nbsp; Patricia Guard, U.S. Department of Education, Potomac Center Plaza, 550 12th Street, SW, room 4108, Washington, DC 20202.<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Table of Contents</h2><p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reporting Requirements </strong></p><p>A-1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are States required to report data regarding significant disproportionality, collected and examined pursuant to 34 CFR &sect;300.646, in their Annual Performance Reports (APRs)?</p><p><br />A-2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are the reporting requirements under 34 CFR &sect;300.646 different from the reporting requirements under Indicators 9 and 10 in the SPP?</p><p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exceptions for Significant Disproportionality</strong> </p><p>B-1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Must a State include children placed in residential facilities or group homes in its calculation of significant disproportionality under 34 CFR &sect;300.646?&nbsp; Does it matter if the child is placed in a different State?<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>A.&nbsp; Reporting Requirements</h2><hr /><p><strong>Authority:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The requirements for reporting on disproportionality are found in the regulations at 34 CFR &sect;&sect;300.600(d) and 300.646.<br /><br /><strong>Question A-1:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are States required to report data regarding significant disproportionality, collected and examined pursuant to 34 CFR &sect;300.646, in their Annual Performance Reports (APRs)?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, States are only required to report, in their APRs, on LEAs with disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education that is the result of inappropriate identification as required by 34 CFR &sect;300.600(d)(3). <br /></p><hr /><p><strong>Question A-2:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are the reporting requirements under 34 CFR &sect;300.646 different from the reporting requirements under Indicators 9 and 10 in the SPP? <br /><br /><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes. In accordance with the requirements in 20 U.S.C. 1416(a)(3)(C) of the IDEA and 34 CFR &sect;300.600(d)(3), an SPP and APR must address the percent of LEAs with disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services (Indicator 9) and in specific disability categories (Indicator 10) that is the result of inappropriate identification.&nbsp; As stated in the Answer to Question A-1 above, States are not required to report on the collection and examination of data to determine significant disproportionality, pursuant to 34 CFR &sect;300.646, in the APR.&nbsp; Although not required to report to the Department, if a State determines that significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity is occurring in a particular LEA with respect to identification of children as children with disabilities, including identification as children with particular impairments, placement in particular educational settings, or the incidence, duration, and type of disciplinary actions including suspensions and expulsions, the State must require the LEA to review and if appropriate revise its policies, procedures or practices and to publicly report on the revision of its policies, practices, and procedures consistent with 34 CFR &sect;300.646.<br /><strong><br /></strong></p><h2><strong>B. Exceptions for Significant Disproportionality</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>Authority:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The requirements for collecting and examining data to determine significant disproportionality are found in the regulations at 34 CFR &sect;300.646.<br /><br /><strong>Question B-1: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Must a State include children placed in residential facilities or group homes in its calculation of significant disproportionality under 34 CFR &sect;300.646? Does it matter if the child is placed in a different State?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether a State must include or may exclude a child with a disability in its calculation of significant disproportionality depends on the agency that places the child in a residential facility or group home and the location of the residential facility or group home, as described below:<br /><br />(i) All children with disabilities placed in a residential facility or group home in the same State by an educational agency must be included in the calculation of significant disproportionality.&nbsp; For purposes of calculating significant disproportionality, however, a State should assign responsibility for counting children with disabilities placed in out-of-district placements to the LEA that is responsible for providing FAPE for those children rather than the LEA in which the child has been placed.<br /><br />(ii) Children with disabilities placed in residential facilities or group homes in the same State by a noneducational agency (e.g., court systems, Department of Corrections, Department of Children, Youth and Families, Social Services, etc.) may be excluded from a State&rsquo;s calculation of significant disproportionality. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />(iii) Children with disabilities placed in a residential facility or group home in a different State by an educational agency should be included in a State&rsquo;s calculation of significant disproportionality in the LEA responsible for providing FAPE for that child (the placing LEA). &nbsp;<br /><br />(iv) Children with disabilities placed in a residential facility or group home in a different State by a noneducational agency (e.g., court systems, Department of Corrections, Department of Children, Youth and Families, Social Services, etc.) may be excluded from the calculation of significant disproportionality by both the State in which the child resides and the State where the residential facility or group home is located.<br /><br /><br /></p></p>
