Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that differences in language and socialization practices must be considered when determining eligibility for special education and related services, including biases related to the assessment.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe that the clarification requested by the commenter is necessary.  The Act and these regulations recognize that some assessments may be biased and discriminatory for children with differences in language and socialization practices.  Section 614(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act requires that assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under the Act are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis.  Additionally, in interpreting evaluation data for the purpose of determining eligibility of a child for special education and related services, Sec. 300.306(c) requires each public agency to draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent input, teacher recommendations, as well as information regarding a child's physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior.  We believe that these provisions provide adequate protection for the concerns raised by the commenter.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that a public agency should not use the "not clearly feasible" exception in Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(ii) to improperly limit a child's right to be evaluated in the child's native language or other mode of communication.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(c)(1)(ii), consistent with section 614(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, requires that assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child be provided and administered in the child's native language or other mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do, unless it is clearly not feasible to so provide or administer.  We agree that this provision should not be improperly used to limit evaluations in a child's native language, but we do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary or that it would prevent inappropriate application of the existing rule.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended including "behavior" in the list of areas to be evaluated in Sec. 300.304(c)(4).  Another commenter recommended requiring a functional behavioral assessment to be part of a child's evaluation whenever any member of the IEP Team requests it or raises concerns about the child's behavior.  One commenter asked why physical assessments were not included in the list of assessments that should be conducted.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(c)(4) requires the public agency to ensure that the child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability.  This could include, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, communicative status, and motor abilities.  This is not an exhaustive list of areas that must be assessed.  Decisions regarding the areas to be assessed are determined by the suspected needs of the child.  If a child's behavior or physical status is of concern, evaluations addressing these areas must be conducted.  No further clarification is necessary.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the evaluation report include a description of the extent to which an assessment varied from standard conditions because there are few assessments that produce valid and reliable information for English language learners suspected of having a disability.  Several commenters stated that it is standard practice for professionals administering assessments to include information in their reports when assessments are conducted using nonstandard conditions.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require all evaluation reports to clearly indicate the language or other mode of communication used in assessing a child and a determination of whether using such language or other mode of communication yielded accurate information.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  As stated by several commenters, it is standard test administration practice to include in the evaluation report the extent to which an assessment varied from standard conditions, including the language or other mode of communication that was used in assessing a child.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to include this requirement in the regulations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters recommended that the regulations require public agencies to provide parents with evidence that the assessments to be used are reliable and valid for their particular use, as well as assurances that the assessments will be administered in the child's primary language or mode of communication.  The commenters also recommended that public agencies be required to provide parents with information regarding the assumptions being made about the tests and the inferences that can be drawn from the test results.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(a), consistent with section 614(b)(1) of the Act, requires the public agency to provide notice to the parents of a child with a disability, in accordance with Sec. 300.503, that describes the evaluation procedures the agency proposes to conduct.  To require public agencies to provide all parents with the specific information recommended by the commenters would be burdensome for public agencies, and could be overwhelming for some parents, and therefore, we decline to add such a requirement to the regulations.  While we understand that some parents will want the detailed information mentioned by the commenter, parents can always request such additional information before providing informed written consent for the evaluation or reevaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended that the regulations require comprehensive psychological and educational evaluations to rule out alternate causes of functional impairments in academic achievement.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe the regulations already address the commenters' concerns and we do not believe any further clarification is necessary.  Section 300.304(c)(6) requires that evaluations are sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of the child's special education and related services needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in which the child has been identified.  In addition, Sec. 300.306(b), consistent with section 614(b)(5) of the Act, states that a child must not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor for that determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math, or limited English proficiency.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended that the requirements in new Sec. 300.301(d)(2) and (e) (proposed Sec. 300.301(d)(2)(i) and (ii)), regarding children who transfer to another public agency before an initial evaluation is completed, should be cross-referenced in Sec. 300.304(c)(5). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree that a cross-reference in Sec. 300.304(c)(5) is appropriate.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added "consistent with Sec. 300.301(d)(2) and (e)," following "possible" in Sec. 300.304(c)(5).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In reviewing Sec. 300.304(c)(5), we determined that Sec. 300.304(c)(5) should be amended to refer to children with disabilities who transfer to another public agency "in the same school year" rather than "in the same academic year" because that is the term most commonly understood by parents and school officials.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have changed "academic year" to "school year" in Sec. 300.304(c)(5). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended adding language regarding scientifically based special education and related services to Sec. 300.304(c)(6).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.304(c)(6) requires that the evaluation of a child with a disability be sufficiently comprehensive to identify all the child's special education and related services needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in which the child has been classified.  We believe that the focus on providing scientifically based special education and related services is clear in the Act and these regulations and do not believe it is necessary to refer to "scientifically based" services each time we refer to special education and related services.  Therefore, we decline to add this language in Sec. 300.304(c)(6), as requested by the commenter. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
