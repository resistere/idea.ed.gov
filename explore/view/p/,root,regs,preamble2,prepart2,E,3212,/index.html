Impartial due process hearing (Sec. 300.511)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that section 615(f)(1)(A) of the Act refers to when a due process complaint is "received" and recommended using this language in Sec. 300.511(a), which refers to when a due process complaint is "filed."  The commenter stated that LEAs are more likely to understand and relate to when a due process complaint is "received" versus when a due process complaint is "filed."</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We agree with the commenter and are changing Sec. 300.511(a) to be consistent with section 615(f)(1)(A) of the Act, which provides that a parent or the LEA must have the opportunity for an impartial due process hearing under this part when a due process complaint is received under section 615(b)(6) or (k) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  For consistency with statutory language, we have changed the first clause in the first sentence of Sec. 300.511(a) by removing the words "filed under Sec. 300.507" and adding in their place the words "received under Sec. 300.507 or Sec. 300.532".  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that a party has a right to seek immediate intervention from a hearing officer to resolve pre-hearing issues and disputes.  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that hearing officers are empowered and obligated to promptly hear and decide all pre-hearing issues and disputes so that decisions can be made about whether to proceed to a hearing, as well as to focus and streamline the evidentiary hearing process.  The commenter provided the following examples of pre-hearing issues that should be resolved prior to a hearing:  the sufficiency of the complaint; the sufficiency of the response and notice pursuant to Sec. 300.508(e); the sufficiency of the response pursuant to Sec. 300.508(f); motions for stay-put; the hearing schedule; the order of witnesses; the burden of proof; the burden of going forward; witness testimony by telephone or video conference; production of records; exchange of evidence; admissibility of evidence; and issuance and enforcement of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(c)(2)(D) and (E) of the Act, respectively, address situations where it is necessary for hearing officers to make determinations regarding the sufficiency of a complaint and amendments to a complaint before a due process hearing.  We do not believe it is necessary to regulate further on the other pre-hearing issues and decisions mentioned by the commenters because we believe that States should have considerable latitude in determining appropriate procedural rules for due process hearings as long as they are not inconsistent with the basic elements of due process hearings and rights of the parties set out in the Act and these regulations.  The specific application of those procedures to particular cases generally should be left to the discretion of hearing officers who have the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with standard legal practice.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a hearing officer from making determinations on procedural matters not addressed in the Act so long as such determinations are made in a manner that is consistent with a parent's or a public agency's right to a timely due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the Act does not provide adequate guidance on the specific set of legal procedures that must be followed in conducting a due process hearing and recommended that the regulations include guidance regarding the following:  limiting the use of hearsay testimony; requiring all testimony to be subject to cross-examination; the order of testimony; timelines; and the statute of limitations.  The commenter stated that while timelines and the statute of limitations are addressed in the Act, there are no consequences for failure to comply.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In addition to addressing timelines, hearing rights, and statutes of limitations, the Act and these regulations also address a significant due process right relating to the impartiality and qualifications of hearing officers.  Under Section 615(f)(3) of the Act and Sec. 300.511(c), a hearing officer must possess the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard legal practice.  Hearing officers consider failure to comply with timelines and statutes of limitations on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  We believe that the requirements for hearing officers are sufficient to ensure that proper legal procedures are used and that it is not appropriate to regulate on every applicable  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
legal procedure that a hearing officer must follow, because those are matters of State law. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
