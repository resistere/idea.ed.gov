Child find for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (Sec. 300.131)  <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended permitting the LEA where private schools are located to request reimbursement from the LEA where the child resides for the cost of conducting an individual evaluation, as may be required under the child find requirements in Sec. 300.131.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended that the LEA where private schools are located be responsible for locating and identifying children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools and the LEA where the children reside be responsible for conducting individual evaluations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.131, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools in which the child is enrolled are located, not the LEA where the child resides, is responsible for conducting child find, including an individual evaluation for a child with a disability enrolled by the child's parent in a private elementary school or secondary school located in the LEA.  The Act specifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting both the child find process and the initial evaluation.  Therefore, the LEA where private schools are located may not seek reimbursement from the LEA of residence for the cost of conducting the evaluation or to request that the LEA of residence conduct the evaluation.  However, the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located has options as to how it meets its responsibilities.  For example, the LEA may assume the responsibility itself, contract with another public agency (including the public agency of residence), or make other arrangements.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended permitting a parent who enrolled a child in a private elementary school or secondary school the option of not participating in child find required under Sec. 300.131.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(e)(4) clarifies that parents who enroll their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools have the option of not participating in an LEA's child find activities required under Sec. 300.131.  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart D, once parents opt out of the public schools, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children as they do for children enrolled in public schools, in light of the public agencies' obligation to educate public school children with disabilities.  We further indicate in the discussion of subpart D that we have added new Sec. 300.300(e)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.300(d)) to clarify that if the parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the child's parent at the parent's own expense does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or reevaluation, the public agency may not use the due process procedures in section 615 of the Act and the public agency is not required to consider the child for equitable services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters recommended permitting amounts expended for child find, including individual evaluations, to be deducted from the required amount of funds to be expended on equitable services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The requested changes would be inconsistent with the Act.  There is a distinction under the Act between the obligation to conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, and the obligation to use an amount of funds equal to a proportionate amount of the Federal Part B grant flowing to LEAs to provide special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  The obligation to conduct child find for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, is independent of the services provision.  Further, Sec. 300.131(d), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IV) of the Act, clarifies that the costs of child find activities for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether the LEA has spent an appropriate amount on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarifying whether an LEA may exclude children suspected of having certain disabilities, such as those with specific learning disabilities, in conducting individual evaluations of suspected children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located must identify and evaluate all children suspected of having disabilities as defined under section 602(3) of the Act.  LEAs may not exclude children suspected of having certain disabilities, such as those with specific learning disabilities, from their child find activities.  The Department recommends that LEAs and private elementary schools and secondary schools consult on how best to implement the State's evaluation criteria and the requirements under this part for identifying children with specific learning disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents.  This is explained in more detail in the discussion of comments under Sec. 300.307.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that parents who place their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools outside the district of residence, and who are determined by the LEA where the private schools are located, through its child find process, to be children with disabilities eligible for special education and related services, would have no knowledge of the special education and related services available for their children if they choose to attend a public school in their district of residence.  A few commenters suggested clarifying the obligation of the LEA where the private school is located to provide the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally-placed private school child. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
A few commenters recommended that the parent of a child with a disability identified through the child find process in Sec. 300.131 be provided with information regarding an appropriate educational program for the child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act is silent on the obligation of officials of the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools are located to share personally identifiable information, such as individual evaluation information, with officials of the LEA of the parent's residence.  We believe that the LEA where the private schools are located has an obligation to protect the privacy of children placed in private schools by their parents.  We believe that when a parentally-placed private school child is evaluated and identified as a child with a disability by the LEA in which the private school is located, parental consent should be required before such personally identifiable information is released to officials of the LEA of the parent's residence.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to make this clear.  We explain this revision in more detail in the discussion of comments under Sec. 300.622.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe the regulations adequately ensure that parents of children enrolled in private schools by their parents, who are identified as children with disabilities through the child find process, receive information regarding an appropriate educational program for their children.  Section 300.138(b) provides that each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated to receive equitable services must have a services plan that describes the specific education and related services that the LEA where the private school is located has determined it will make available to the child and the services plan must, to the extent appropriate, meet the IEP content, development, review and revision requirements described in section 614(d) of the Act, or, when appropriate, for children aged three through five, the IFSP requirements described in section 636(d) of the Act as to the services that are to be provided.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Furthermore, the LEA where the private school is located must, pursuant to Sec. 300.504(a) and section 615(d) of the Act, provide the parent a copy of the procedural safeguards notice upon conducting the initial evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have added a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to require parental consent for the disclosure of records of parentally-placed private school children between LEAs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.131 does not address which LEA has the responsibility for reevaluations.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting reevaluations of children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools located within the LEA.  Reevaluation is a part of the LEA's child find responsibility for parentally-placed private school children under section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter expressed concern that the regulations permit a parent to request an evaluation from the LEA of residence at the same time the child is being evaluated by the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located, resulting in two LEAs simultaneously conducting evaluations of the same child.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Some commenters requested the regulations clarify which LEA (the LEA of residence or the LEA where the private elementary schools or secondary schools are located) is responsible for offering FAPE to children identified through child find under Sec. 300.131 so that parents can make an informed decision regarding their children's education.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If a determination is made by the LEA where the private school is located that a child needs special education and related services, the LEA where the child resides is responsible for making FAPE available to the child.  If the parent makes clear his or her intention to keep the child enrolled in the private elementary school or secondary school located in another LEA, the LEA where the child resides need not make FAPE available to the child.  We do not believe that a change to the regulations is necessary, as Sec. 300.201 already clarifies that the district of residence is responsible for making FAPE available to the child.  Accordingly, the district in which the private elementary or secondary school is located is not responsible for making FAPE available to a child residing in another district.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested clarification of the term "activities similar" in Sec. 300.131(c).  Another commenter recommended clarifying that these activities include, but are not limited to, activities relating to evaluations and reevaluations.  One commenter requested that children with disabilities parentally-placed in private schools be identified and evaluated as quickly as possible.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.131(c), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(III) of the Act, requires that, in carrying out child find for parentally-placed private school children, SEAs and LEAs must undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for their publicly enrolled or publicly-placed children.  This would generally include, but is not limited to, such activities as widely distributing informational brochures, providing regular public service announcements, staffing exhibits at health fairs and other community activities, and creating direct liaisons with private schools.  Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.  In addition, evaluations of all children suspected of having disabilities under Part B of the Act, regardless of whether they are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools, must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311, consistent with section 614(a) through (c) of the Act, which describes the procedures for evaluations and reevaluations for all children with disabilities.  We believe the phrase "activities similar" is understood by SEAs and LEAs and, therefore, it is not necessary to regulate on the meaning of the phrase.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
