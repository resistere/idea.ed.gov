Prior notice by the public agency; content of notice (Sec. 300.503)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter stated that the prior written notice be given to parents as soon as possible, but no later than 15 days before the public agency proposes to initiate or refuse a change.  Another commenter recommended requiring IEP Teams to carefully consider all the data and options before making a decision to change a child's placement or refuse the parent's request for services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.503(a) incorporates section 615(b)(3) of the Act and requires a public agency to provide parents with written notice that meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503(b) a reasonable time before the public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  We do not believe that it is necessary to substitute a specific timeline to clarify what is meant by the requirement that the notice be provided within a reasonable period of time, because we are not aware of significant problems in the timing of prior written notices.  In addition, prior written notice is provided in a wide variety of circumstances for which any one timeline would be too rigid and, in many cases, might prove unworkable.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	We do not believe that it is necessary to add a requirement that IEP Teams carefully consider all the data and options before making a decision to change a child's placement or refuse the parent's request for services.  Section 300.306(c) already requires the group of professionals and the parent of the child to carefully consider information from a variety of sources before determining a child's eligibility and placement.  Furthermore, the requirements for developing, reviewing, and revising a child's IEP in Sec. 300.324, ensure that IEP Teams carefully consider all available information in developing an IEP, including information from the child's parents. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested permitting the prior written notice to be the IEP itself, rather than requiring a separate document.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a public agency from using the IEP as part of the prior written notice so long as the document(s) the parent receives meet all the requirements in Sec. 300.503.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked how a parent would know that the public agency is refusing to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or placement of a child without an IEP Team meeting.  Another commenter stated that prior written notice should be provided in advance of an IEP Team meeting, not at the IEP Team meeting, so that parents could prepare for the meeting.  The commenter suggested adding language to the regulations requiring that the notice be given a reasonable time before an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The commenter confuses the Act's prior written notice requirements with the requirements governing IEP Team meetings.  Section 300.503(a), consistent with section 615(b)(3) of the Act, requires prior written notice whenever a public agency proposes to initiate or change (or refuses to initiate or change) the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision of FAPE to a child.  A public agency meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503 so long as the prior written notice is provided a reasonable time before the public agency implements the proposal (or refusal) described in the notice.  A public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting before it proposes a change in the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  The proposal, however, triggers the obligation to convene an IEP Team meeting.  Providing prior written notice in advance of meetings could suggest, in some circumstances, that the public agency's proposal was improperly arrived at before the meeting and without parent input.  Therefore, we are not changing Sec. 300.503 to require the prior written notice to be provided prior to an IEP Team meeting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.503(a)(2), which provides that if the prior written notice relates to an action that also requires parental consent, the agency may give notice at the same time it requests parental consent.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to explain in the regulations that prior written notice can be provided at the same time as parental consent is requested, because parental consent cannot be obtained without the requisite prior written notice.  The removal of this regulatory provision, however, is not intended to prohibit a public agency from giving prior written notice at the same time that parental consent is sought, should the agency choose to do so.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked that the public agency be required to provide a description of all the proposals made by anyone on the IEP Team and the reasons why one proposal was chosen over another.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.503(b)(1) and (b)(2) require the prior written notice to include a description of the action proposed or refused by the agency and an explanation of why the agency proposes or refuses to take the action.  We do not believe that the change suggested by the commenter is needed because Sec. 300.503(b)(6) and (b)(7) already require that the prior written notice include a description of the other options that the IEP Team considered, the reasons why those options were rejected, and a description of other factors that are relevant to the agency's proposal or refusal.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter suggested requiring the SEA to provide a list of resources for parents to obtain assistance in understanding the requirements of the Act, including providing easy access to the information on the State's Web site.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.503(b)(5), consistent with section 615(c)(1)(D) of the Act, already requires the prior written notice to include sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions of this part.  The Department believes that parents should have easy access to information regarding resources to understand the provisions of the Act.  For many parents, this may include accessing such information on the State's Web site.  Each State is in the best position to determine whether including this information on its Web site would be helpful for parents.  Therefore, we decline to add this requirement to the regulations. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended removing Sec. 300.503(c)(2), regarding the public agency's responsibilities when the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a written language.  The commenter recommended, instead, requiring a public agency to use procedures that involve little or no cost.  One commenter stated that Sec. 300.503(c)(2) should be removed because all but paragraph (c)(2)(ii), regarding ensuring that the parent understands the content of the prior written notice, exceed statutory requirements.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  For parents whose mode of communication is not a written language, Sec. 300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent and that the parent understands the content of the notice.  We decline to remove Sec. 300.503(c) because we believe that these rights, as well as the other rights enumerated in Sec. 300.503(c), are essential to ensure that public agencies provide all parents the requisite prior written notice in a meaningful and understandable manner.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
