Services (Sec. 300.530(d))<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters expressed concern that the change from "continue to progress in the general curriculum" in current Sec. 300.522(b)(1) to "continue to participate in the general education curriculum" in Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) is a lower standard.  They requested that we use the language from current Sec. 300.522(b)(1).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(d)(1) provide that a child must continue to receive educational services so as to enable the child "to continue to participate in the general educational curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP."  We believe that using the statutory language in the regulation is appropriate because the Act specifically uses different language to describe a child's relationship to the general education curriculum in periods of removal for disciplinary reasons than for services under the child's regular IEP in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act.  Based on this difference, we decline to make the change requested.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We caution that we do not interpret "participate" to mean that a school or district must replicate every aspect of the services that a child would receive if in his or her normal classroom.  For example, it would not generally be feasible for a child removed for disciplinary reasons to receive every aspect of the services that a child would receive if in his or her chemistry or auto mechanics classroom as these classes generally are taught using a hands-on component or specialized equipment or facilities.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  Many commenters recommended Sec. 300.530(d) clarify that children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct and are removed from their current placement to an interim alternative educational setting or another setting, or are suspended, are entitled to FAPE in accordance with section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Several commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) to explicitly state that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons must include all the special education services, related services, supplementary aids and services, and accommodations required by the child's IEP to ensure the child receives FAPE.  Many commenters requested that the regulations clarify that LEAs must continue to implement a child's IEP as written, including related services, while the child is in an interim alternative educational setting.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Section 300.530(d) clarifies that decisions regarding the extent to which services would need to be provided and the amount of services that would be necessary to enable a child with a disability to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and progress toward achieving the goals on the child's IEP may be different if the child is removed from his or her regular placement for a short period of time.  For example, a child who is removed for a short period of time and who is performing at grade level may not need the same kind and amount of services to meet this standard as a child who is removed from his or her regular placement for 45 days under Sec. 300.530(g) or Sec. 300.532 and not performing at grade level.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We believe it is reasonable for school personnel (if the child is to be removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year and not considered a change in placement) and the IEP Team (if the child's removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536 and not a manifestation of the child's disability or a removal pursuant to Sec. 300.530(g)) to make informed educational decisions about the extent to which services must be provided for a child with a disability placed in an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension to enable the child to participate in the general education curriculum and make progress toward the goals of the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
As stated above, we read the Act as modifying the concept of FAPE in circumstances where a child is removed from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons.  Specifically, we interpret section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to require that the special education and related services that are necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP, must be provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and, to the extent appropriate to the circumstances, be provided in conformity with the child's IEP.  We, therefore, believe Sec. 300.530(d)(1) should be amended to be consistent with the Act by adding the reference to the FAPE requirements in Sec. 300.101(a), and to ensure it is understood that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons are consistent with the FAPE requirements in section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are making additional technical changes to paragraph (d)(1) to eliminate cross-references, where appropriate, and to provide greater clarity that children with disabilities removed for disciplinary reasons pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section must continue to receive services and receive, as appropriate, a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention services and modifications.  We are, therefore, removing from paragraph (d)(1) of this section the phrase "except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4)" and removing the reference to paragraph (b) of this section, which references the general authority for removing a child who violates a code of student conduct, as it is unnecessary. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Section 300.530(d)(1)(i) has been amended to be consistent with section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act by cross-referencing the FAPE requirement in Sec. 300.101(a).  We have also revised paragraph (d)(1) by removing the reference to the exceptions for paragraph (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section and removing the reference to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  In light of the changes made to proposed paragraph (d)(1) of this section by removing the phrase regarding the exceptions for paragraph (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, it is necessary to revise Sec. 300.530(d)(2) to accurately reflect when services may be provided in an interim alternative educational setting. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have modified Sec. 300.530(d)(2) to clarify that services required by paragraph (d)(1), (d)3), (d)(4), and (d)(5) of this section may be provided in an interim alternative educational setting.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Several commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(3) is not clear and requested clarification as to whether children who are removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive services.  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.530(d)(3), which clarifies that a public agency is only required to provide services to a child with a disability who is removed from his or her current placement for 10 school days or less in that school year if it provides services to a child without disabilities who is similarly removed, is unsupported by the Act and substantially undermines the rights afforded to children with disabilities removed from their current placement for disciplinary reasons.  The commenter wanted this provision removed from the regulations.  Other commenters requested clarifying the authority of school personnel with respect to the procedures in Sec. 300.530(d)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.  We also are amending paragraph (d)(3) of this section to write it in active voice and in the positive and removed the cross-reference to the general provision in paragraph (b) of this section, as it is not necessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  Technical changes have been made to Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to remove the cross-reference to paragraph (b) of this section.  We also amended this paragraph as stated above to provide greater clarity.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters wanted us to remove the words "if any" from Sec. 300.530(d)(4).  Several commenters thought that Sec. 300.530(d)(4), which allows school personnel to determine the extent to which services are needed, "if any," gives public agencies the authority to deny special education services to students who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year.  Other commenters also thought that including the phrase "if any" implies that special education services are not mandatory for a child who has been removed for 10 or more non-consecutive days and do not constitute a change in placement.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.  The Act is clear that the public agency must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals in the child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We recognize the concern of the commenters that the phrase "if any" could imply that school personnel need not provide educational services to these children.  Therefore, we are removing the phrase "if any" from paragraph (d)(4).  For clarity, we are replacing the cross-reference to Sec. 300.530(d)(1) with the language from Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) and restructure the paragraph.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  The phrase "if any" has been removed from Sec. 300.530(d)(4).  For clarity, we have removed a cross reference in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) and replaced it with the language from Sec. 300.530(d)(1)(i) and made technical edits to restructure the paragraph.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter questioned whether the ability of school personnel to remove a child from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons means, if a child's current placement is a special education classroom setting, school personnel may remove the child from special education services.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  If the child's current placement is a special education setting, the child could be removed from the special education setting to another setting for disciplinary reasons.  Similarly, if the child with a disability who violated a school code of conduct receives services in a regular classroom, the child could be removed to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  Section 300.530(b), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act, provides that school personnel may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his or her current placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  However, Sec. 300.530(d) is clear that the child who is removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive educational services, to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in his or her IEP.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested clarifying how many days a child with a disability may be placed in an interim alternative educational setting before the public agency must provide services. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  School personnel may remove a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension for up to 10 school days in the same school year without providing educational services.  Beginning, however, on the eleventh cumulative day in a school year that a child with a disability is removed from the child's current placement, and for any subsequent removals, educational services must be provided to the extent required in Sec. 300.530(d), while the removal continues. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended revising Sec. 300.530(d)(4) to require that the parent be included in the consultation school personnel must have with at least one of the child's teachers to determine the extent to which services are needed for a child with a disability who has been removed from his or her current placement for more than 10 school days (if the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change in placement under Sec. 300.536). </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.  However, there is nothing in these regulations that would prohibit school personnel, if they choose to do so, from including parents in the consultation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter requested that Sec. 300.530(d)(4) be modified to include the requirement in current Sec. 300.121(d)(3)(i) that school personnel consult with the child's special education teacher as opposed to any of the child's teachers.  The commenter stated that it makes sense that the special education teacher be considered the first choice for this role given that the special education teacher generally has the most knowledge of the child and the student's educational needs.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The determination of which teacher school personnel should consult should be based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the needs of the child and the expertise of the child's teachers.  We agree that, in many cases, the special education teacher may be the most appropriate teacher with whom school personnel should consult.  This, however, is not always the case.  In light of the short-term nature of the removals under paragraph (d)(4) of the section and the need for school personnel to make quick decisions regarding services, we believe local school personnel need broad flexibility in making such decisions and are in the best position to determine the appropriate teacher with whom to consult.  For these reasons, we are not amending Sec. 300.530(d)(4) to require consultation with the child's special education teacher as in current Sec. 300.121(d)(3)(i).  There is nothing, however, in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit school personnel from consulting with one of the child's special education teachers.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Discussion:  It is not necessary to include the language recommended by the commenters as section 612(a)(16)(A) of the Act is clear that the State must ensure that all children with disabilities are included in all general State and districtwide assessment programs, including assessments described in section 1111 of the ESEA, 20 U.S.C. 6311, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments, if necessary, and as indicated in each child's respective IEP.  This requirement applies to children with disabilities who have been placed in an appropriate interim alternative education setting or another setting, or who are suspended.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter requested specifying in Sec. 300.530(d) that LEAs must include children with disabilities placed in interim alternative educational settings in their determination of AYP.  The writer expressed concern that LEAs may try to avoid accountability by placing children with disabilities in interim alternative educational settings.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The Act does not address the issue of AYP. However, title 1 of the ESEA is clear that children who are enrolled within a district for a full academic year must be included in the AYP reports of an LEA.  (20 U.S.C. 7325)  Title 1 of the ESEA does not provide an exception for children with disabilities placed in interim alternative educational settings.  In addition, State agencies, LEAs, and schools must assess all children, regardless of whether a child is to be included for reporting or accountability purposes and regardless of the amount of time the child has been enrolled in the State agency, LEA, or school.  The only public school children with disabilities enrolled in public settings who are exempted from participation in State and districtwide assessment programs under the Act are children with disabilities convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons (Sec. 300.324(d)(1)(i)).  As AYP is addressed under title 1 of the ESEA, we do not need to regulate on this matter. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, which requires that within 10 school days of any decision to change a child's placement because of a violation of a code of conduct, the LEA, parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall consider whether the conduct was caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the disability or whether the conduct was caused by the failure of the LEA to implement the IEP.  These commenters stated that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) gives the IEP Team control over determinations regarding services and placement, regardless of manifestation, and does not give control to the LEA, parent and relevant members of the IEP Team as provided in the Act.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

Comment:  One commenter stated that the phrase "location in which services will be provided" as used in Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is not included in the Act.  The commenter pointed out that section 615(k)(2) of the Act refers to the IEP Team's "determination of setting."  The commenter stated that using the statutory language will make it less likely the IEP Team will interpret the regulations to require the IEP Team to determine the specific location of the services to be provided to a child removed from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting.  Several other commenters stated that the use of the phrase "location in which services will be provided" in paragraph (d)(5) of this section is confusing and recommended limiting the IEP Team responsibility to determining the setting (as required under section 615(k)(2) of the Act) and the services and not the specific location.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We are persuaded by the commenters and, therefore, are removing the reference to "location in which services will be provided" in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.  We are also removing the phrase "is for more than 10 consecutive school days or" from paragraphs (d)(5) of this section because it is unnecessary since such a removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  We have amended paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section by removing the phrase "location in which services will be provided."  We also have amended paragraph (d)(5) of this section by removing the phrase "is for more than 10 consecutive school days or." </p></p>
