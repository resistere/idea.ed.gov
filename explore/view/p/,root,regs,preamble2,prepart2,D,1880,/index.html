Reevaluations (Sec. 300.303)<p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters recommended clarifying that a parent is not required to provide a reason for requesting a reevaluation.  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require a public agency to provide prior written notice if a parent requests a reevaluation within a year and the public agency refuses the request.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.303(b), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation may occur if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  There is no requirement that a reason for the reevaluation be given and we agree that a reevaluation cannot be conditioned on the parent providing a reason for requesting a reevaluation. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	Section 300.303(b), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B) of the Act, provides that a reevaluation may occur not more than once a year and must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise.  If a parent requests more than one reevaluation in a year and the public agency does not believe a reevaluation is needed, we believe the regulations are clear that the public agency must provide the parents with written notice of the agency's refusal to conduct a reevaluation, consistent with Sec. 300.503 and section 615(c)(1) of the Act.  We do not believe additional regulations are necessary to address this specific instance of a public agency's refusal to initiate a reevaluation and the written notice requirements in Sec. 300.503.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  A few commenters requested clarification regarding whether an evaluation that assesses skills that were not previously assessed in the same related services area would be considered an evaluation or reevaluation.  One commenter, asked, for example, if a speech-language evaluation was conducted to assess a child's speech impairment one year, would an evaluation the following year to assess the child's language abilities be considered an evaluation or reevaluation?</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An initial evaluation of a child is the first complete assessment of a child to determine if the child has a disability under the Act, and the nature and extent of special education and related services required.  Once a child has been fully evaluated, a decision has been rendered that a child is eligible for services under the Act, and the required services have been determined, any subsequent evaluation of a child would constitute a reevaluation.  In the example provided by the commenter, the second evaluation would be considered a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that reevaluations be required at least once every three years because a child's mental and physical profile changes in three years, and thus, so would the child's educational needs.  Another commenter recommended requiring LEAs to inform parents that information from the most recent evaluation, which could be three or more years old if the parent agrees that a reevaluation is unnecessary, will be used in the development of a child's IEP.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	A few commenters recommended an accountability process for LEAs that do not conduct reevaluations at least every three years.  The commenters recommended requiring LEAs to report to the State the number of children with disabilities who qualified for, but were not given a three-year reevaluation; provide prior written notice to parents if the LEA determines that a three-year reevaluation is not necessary, including the justification for such determination; and inform the parent in writing in the parent's language that a three-year reevaluation will be conducted if the parent disagrees with the LEA's determination.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
One commenter recommended requiring an LEA that does not conduct a reevaluation at least once every three years to justify the reasons in writing, especially if there is evidence that the child is not meeting the State's academic achievement standards.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, requires a reevaluation to occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
	It would be overly burdensome to require an LEA to report to the State the number of children with disabilities who qualified for, but were not given a three-year reevaluation.  Similarly, it would be overly burdensome to require LEAs to inform parents that information from the most recent evaluation will be used to develop a child's IEP or to justify to the parent in writing the LEA's reasons for not conducting a reevaluation every three years if the parent and the agency have already agreed that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
If a parent requests a reevaluation and the public agency disagrees that a reevaluation is needed, the public agency must provide prior written notice to the parent, consistent with Sec. 300.503, that explains, among other things, why the agency refuses to conduct the reevaluation and the parent's right to contest the agency's decision through mediation or a due process hearing.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
In situations where a public agency believes a reevaluation is necessary, but the parent disagrees and refuses consent for a reevaluation, new Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(ii) is clear that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the consent override procedures described in Sec. 300.300(a)(3).</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended the following requirements for the reevaluation of a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities who is assessed based on alternate achievement standards:  (a) prohibiting the public agency from automatically determining that a three-year reevaluation is not needed; (b) requiring the public agency to consider whether the child has been correctly identified to be assessed against alternate achievement standards; and (c) requiring a review of evaluation data to determine whether the child is, to the extent possible, being educated in the general curriculum and assessed with instruments aligned with that curriculum.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  We do not believe changes to the regulations are necessary to address the commenter's concerns.  The Act does not include any special requirements for the reevaluation of a child with the most significant cognitive disabilities who is assessed against alternate achievement standards.  It would be inconsistent with the individualized evaluation and reevaluation procedures in section 614(b) and (c) of the Act for a public agency to automatically determine that reevaluations are unnecessary for a specific group of children.  In determining whether a reevaluation is needed, the parent and the public agency must consider the child's educational needs, which may include whether the child is participating in the general education curriculum and being assessed appropriately.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended clarifying that parents have the right to prevent the over-testing of their child and that the requirements for reevaluations do not diminish the rights of parents to make decisions regarding the reevaluation.  Several commenters recommended that the regulations require States to establish additional procedural safeguards to ensure that parents who agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary are aware of the implications of their decision.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the requirements for reevaluations in Sec. 300.303 diminish the rights of parents.  As stated in Sec. 300.303, consistent with section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a parent can request a reevaluation at any time, and can agree with the public agency to conduct a reevaluation more frequently than once a year.  Likewise, a parent and a public agency can agree that a reevaluation is not necessary.  We believe that in reaching an agreement that a reevaluation is unnecessary, as provided for in Sec. 300.303(b), the parent and public agency will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of conducting a reevaluation, as well as what effect a reevaluation might have on the child's educational program.  Therefore, we do not agree with the commenter that additional procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure that parents who agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary are aware of the implications of their decision.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  Many commenters requested that the opportunity to waive a reevaluation occur only after the IEP Team has reviewed extant data to determine whether additional data are needed to determine the child's eligibility and the educational needs of the child.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The review of existing data is part of the reevaluation process.  Section 300.305(a), consistent with section 614(c)(1) of the Act, is clear that, as part of any reevaluation, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, must review existing evaluation data, and on the basis of that review, and input from the child's parents, identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether the child continues to have a disability, and the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the opportunity for a parent and the public agency to agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary occurs before a reevaluation begins.  It would be inconsistent with the Act to implement the commenters' recommendation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that waiving a three-year reevaluation must not be adopted as routine agency policy or practice and should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations require the LEA to offer parents a reevaluation at least annually when a parent agrees that a three-year reevaluation is not needed.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that a reevaluation may be warranted more than once a year if the child's condition changes or new information becomes available that has an impact on the child's educational situation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language clarifying that waiving three-year reevaluations must not be a routine agency policy or practice because the regulations are clear that this is a decision that is made individually for each child by the parent of the child and the public agency.  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  When a parent and a public agency agree that a three-year reevaluation is unnecessary, there is no requirement that the public agency offer the parent a reevaluation each year.  We do not believe that it is necessary to have such a requirement because if parents who have waived a three year reevaluation later decide to request an evaluation, they can do so.  Also, public agencies have a continuing responsibility to request parental consent for a reevaluation if they determine that the child's educational or related services needs warrant a reevaluation.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
We do not believe additional regulations are needed to clarify that a reevaluation can occur more than once a year.  Section 300.303(b)(1), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, already provides that a reevaluation can occur more than once a year if the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is needed.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether the agreement between the parent and the public agency that a reevaluation is unnecessary is the same as parental consent in Sec. 300.9.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An agreement between a parent and a public agency is not the same as parental consent in Sec. 300.9.  Rather, an agreement refers to an understanding between a parent and the public agency and does not need to meet the requirements for parental consent in Sec. 300.9.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that when a parent obtains an independent educational evaluation (IEE) and provides new information to the public agency, a reevaluation could be conducted more than once a year so that the public agency can verify the results of the IEE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  The changes recommended by the commenter are unnecessary.  Section 300.303(b)(1), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, is clear that a reevaluation can be conducted more than once a year if the parent and the public agency agree that it is necessary.  Therefore, in the situation presented by the commenter, if the results of an IEE provide new information that the public agency and the parent agree warrant a reevaluation, the parent and the public agency could agree to conduct a reevaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Comment:  One commenter asked whether an IEE is considered a reevaluation and whether an IEE is prohibited within less than a year of the public agency's most recent evaluation.  </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Discussion:  An IEE would be considered as a potential source of additional information that the public agency and parent could consider in determining whether the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation, but it would not be considered a reevaluation.  There is no restriction on when a parent can request an IEE. </p><p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Changes:  None.</p></p>
