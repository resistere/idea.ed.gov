Bush.&nbsp; The provisions of the act became effective on July 1,  2005, with the exception of some of the elements pertaining to the  definition of a &ldquo;highly qualified teacher&rdquo; that took  effect upon the signing of the act.&nbsp; The final regulations  were published on Aug. 14, 2006.&nbsp; This is one in a series of  documents, prepared by the Office of Special Education and  Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) in the U.S. Department of Education  that covers a variety of high-interest topics and brings together  the regulatory requirements related to those topics to support  constituents in preparing to implement the new  regulations.<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;

[20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10)(A)(ii)]<br>  <br>  The cost of carrying out child find, including individual  evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether an LEA  has met its obligations under 34 CFR 300.133 (expenditures), as  described below.<br>  [34 CFR 300.131(c)]&nbsp;

 &nbsp;related services under 34 CFR Part 300.&nbsp; The LEA must  initiate and conduct meetings to &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;develop,  review, and revise a services plan for a child designated to  receive services.&nbsp; The &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LEA must ensure that  a representative of the religious or other private school attends  each &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;meeting. The LEA must use other methods to  ensure participation by the religious or other &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;private school, including individual or conference telephone  calls, if the representative &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cannot  attend.&nbsp; The services plan must describe the specific special  education and related &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;services that the LEA will  provide to the child in light of the services that the LEA has  &nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;The child find process, including:<br>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How parentally-placed private school children  suspected of having a disability can participate equitably; and<br>  o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How parents, teachers, and private school  officials will be informed of the process.<br>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and<br>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ensure that the count is conducted on  any date between October 1 and December 1, inclusive, of each  year.<br>  The count must be used to determine the amount that the LEA must  spend on providing special education and related services to  parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in the  next subsequent fiscal year.<br>  [34 CFR 300.133(c)]&nbsp; [20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10)(A)]<br>  <br>  Requirements for Expenditures<br>  <br>  11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Require each LEA to use funds for services  for parentally-placed private school &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;children  with disabilities according to a formula.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each LEA must spend an amount to meet its  obligations to parentally-placed private school &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;children with disabilities that is equal to a proportionate  amount of Federal funds made &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;available under the  Act.
