<p><strong>(See also Alignment With the <em>No Child Left Behind
Act</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The reauthorized <em>Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act</em> (IDEA) was signed into law on Dec. 3, 2004, by President
George W. Bush. The provisions of the act became effective on July
1, 2005, with the exception of some of the elements pertaining to
the definition of a &ldquo;highly qualified teacher&rdquo; that
took effect upon the signing of the act. The final regulations were
released on August 3, 2006. This is one in a series of documents,
prepared by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative
Services (OSERS) in the U.S. Department of Education that covers a
variety of high-interest topics and brings together the regulatory
requirements related to those topics to support constituents in
preparing to implement the new regulations.<a name=
