	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.  In addition, children who do not receive appropriate educational services may develop behavioral problems that have a negative impact on the learning environment for other children.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(e)(4) clarifies that parents who enroll their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools have the option of not participating in an LEA's child find activities required under Sec. 300.131.  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart D, once parents opt out of the public schools, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children as they do for children enrolled in public schools, in light of the public agencies' obligation to educate public school children with disabilities.  We further indicate in the discussion of subpart D that we have added new Sec. 300.300(e)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.300(d)) to clarify that if the parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the child's parent at the parent's own expense does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or reevaluation, the public agency may not use the due process procedures in section 615 of the Act and the public agency is not required to consider the child for equitable services.  </span></dd>

considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available

Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.

As part of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.604, States must report annually on indicators in three monitoring priority areas.  One of the monitoring priority areas is disproportionality, for which there are two indicators.  In addition to annually reviewing State performance on each indicator in each monitoring priority area, the State must review each LEA against indicators established for each monitoring priority area, so the State will be examining data annually to identify any disproportionality.  If disproportionality is identified in LEAs, the policies, procedures, and practices of the LEAs will be examined to determine if they are leading to inappropriate identification, and, pursuant to section 618(d)(2)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.646(b)(3), the LEA will be required to report publicly on the revision of policies, practices, and procedures used in identification or placement.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to add a requirement that LEAs monitor the effect of early intervening services on disproportionality because the LEAS will have to continue to publicly report on their revision of policies, practices and procedures until the significant disproportionality in the LEA is eliminated.

Discussion: The language in Sec.  300.606 is accurate and we

pending enforcement action against the State under section 616(e) of 
the Act to provide public notice of the pendency of that action. 
Pursuant to section 616(d)(2)(B) of the Act, a State that has been

Part B of the Act, faces enforcement actions and is entitled to 
reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing on such a 
determination. If a State requests a hearing on a determination, the

hearing. In this situation, the enforcement action also would depend on

In addition, a parent always has the right to file a due process complaint and request a due process hearing on any matter concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of his or her child, or the provision of FAPE and may seek to resolve their disputes through mediation.  It is important to clarify that when the parent files both a due process complaint and a State complaint on the same issue, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.  However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152, including using the time limit and procedures in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 300.152.

Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.102(a)(3) is sufficiently clear that public agencies need not make FAPE available to children with disabilities who have graduated with a regular high school diploma and that no change is needed to the regulations.  Children with disabilities who have not graduated with a regular high school diploma still have an entitlement to FAPE until the child reaches the age at which eligibility ceases under the age requirements within the State.  However, we have reviewed the regulations and believe that it is important for these regulations to define "regular diploma" consistent with the ESEA regulations in 34 CFR Sec. 200.19(a)(1)(i).  Therefore, we will add language to clarify that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or general educational development (GED) credential.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Section 300.531, consistent with section 615(k)(2) of the Act, provides that the IEP Team determines the interim alternative educational setting for removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Additionally, section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act is clear that, during an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act, the child must remain in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action expires, whichever comes first, unless the parent and the LEA agree otherwise.  Thus, under the Act, whenever a hearing is requested under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the LEA, it is the parties involved in the hearing (i.e., the parent and the LEA), not the IEP Team, that may agree to change the time period of the removal or the interim setting for the child.  We, therefore, do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenter.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations, however, which would prohibit the parents and the LEA from agreeing to involve the IEP Team in any decision to change the time period of the removal or interim alternative educational setting.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Section 300.131(c), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(III) of the Act, requires that, in carrying out child find for parentally-placed private school children, SEAs and LEAs must undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for their publicly enrolled or publicly-placed children.  This would generally include, but is not limited to, such activities as widely distributing informational brochures, providing regular public service announcements, staffing exhibits at health fairs and other community activities, and creating direct liaisons with private schools.  Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.  In addition, evaluations of all children suspected of having disabilities under Part B of the Act, regardless of whether they are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools, must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311, consistent with section 614(a) through (c) of the Act, which describes the procedures for evaluations and reevaluations for all children with disabilities.  We believe the phrase "activities similar" is understood by SEAs and LEAs and, therefore, it is not necessary to regulate on the meaning of the phrase.</span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II) of the Act, creates an exception to the parental consent requirements for initial evaluations for a child who is a ward of the State who is not residing with the child's parent if the public agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain the parent's consent, but is unable to discover the whereabouts of the parent, the rights of the parent of the child have been terminated under State law, or the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge under State law and consent for the initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)) permits the public agency to proceed with the child's initial evaluation without first obtaining the requisite parental consent only in the circumstances detailed in Sec. 300.300(a)(2).  Therefore, when one or more of the circumstances in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) are met and a surrogate has not yet been appointed, the public agency need not postpone the child's evaluation to await the appointment of a surrogate.  This is appropriate because in situations involving requests for initial evaluations, in most cases a surrogate parent has not yet been appointed and delaying an initial evaluation until after a surrogate is appointed and has given consent may not be in the best interests of the child.  In contrast, in most situations involving consent for reevaluation, a surrogate parent should already have been appointed under Sec. 300.519 if no parent can be identified, the public agency has been unable to locate a parent, the child is a ward of the State or the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth.  Therefore, we do not think it is appropriate to apply the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) to reevaluation situations.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</span></dd>
