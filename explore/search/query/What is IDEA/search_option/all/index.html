Identifying the manner in which an LEA meets this requirement, however, is a matter that is best determined by State and local officials.

Section 300.199(a), consistent with section 608(a) of the Act, is intended to minimize the number of rules, regulations, and policies to which LEAs and schools are subject under the Act, and to identify in writing any rule, regulation, or policy that is State-imposed and not required under the Act and its implementing regulations.  The Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 10, which states "Through section 608(a), the committee is in no way attempting to reduce State input or State practice in this area, but intends to make clear what is a Federal obligation and what is a State or local educational agency requirement for the Act."

Discussion:  Section 300.153(b)(4)(v) requires the complainant to propose a resolution to the complaint only to the extent known and available to the complainant at the time the complaint is filed.  We believe this proposed resolution is necessary because it gives the complainant an opportunity to state what he or she believes to be the problem and how the complainant believes it can be resolved.  This is important because it gives the complainant an opportunity to tell the public agency what is wrong and what it would take to fix the problem from the complainant's point of view.  It also will give the LEA an opportunity to choose either to do as the complainant requests or propose a solution that it believes would resolve the issue raised by the complainant.

Discussion: The requirements in Sec.  300.160(b) pertain to guidelines for the use of accommodations in assessments, and do not speak to the use of accommodations in the classroom. However, there is nothing in the IDEA or these regulations that would prohibit the use of accommodations in classroom instruction that, if used in a State assessment, would invalidate a student's score. Likewise, there is nothing in the IDEA or these regulations that would prohibit a State from encouraging IEP Teams to use the accommodation guidelines for assessments to determine the instructional supports to be provided in the classroom. Such instructional supports are generally referred to as supplementary aids and services. Section 300.320(a)(4)(i), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)(aa) of the IDEA, requires the IEP Team to identify the supplementary aids and services to be provided to a child to enable the child to advance appropriately toward meeting the child's annual IEP goals.

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter. Section 607(a) of the IDEA states that the Secretary shall issue regulations only to the extent that such regulations are necessary to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of the IDEA. Section 607(b) of the IDEA provides that the Secretary cannot publish final regulations that would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to children with disabilities in the regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983, except to the extent that such regulations reflect the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress in legislation.

Although it is difficult to estimate the savings from these final regulations, the Secretary expects some savings to be produced because affected special education teachers are not required to demonstrate the same level of content knowledge as other middle and high school teachers of core academic subjects, thereby reducing the amount of additional coursework or professional development that is needed to meet State standards.  The savings depend on the gap between what State standards require in terms of content knowledge for middle and high school teachers in various academic areas and what the affected teachers are able to demonstrate in the academic subjects they are teaching.  Any savings will be offset in part by the cost of developing a means for the affected teachers to demonstrate subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided.  However, this cost is not expected to be significant.  On balance, the Secretary concludes that the final regulations could produce significant savings without adversely affecting the quality of instruction provided to children assessed against alternate achievement standards.</span></dd>

Comment: One commenter opposed proposed Sec.  300.177 because, 
according to the commenter, section 606 of the Act is silent on the 
Department's authority to issue regulations relating to the employment 
of individuals with disabilities. The commenter argued that doing so would be contrary to Congress' intent, in section 607(a) of 
the Act, that the Secretary issue regulations only to the extent that 
such regulations are necessary to ensure compliance with the specific 
requirements of the IDEA. The commenter further noted that proposed 
Sec.  300.177(b) is unnecessary because in order to receive a grant 
under Part B of the IDEA, each State must already have on file with the 
Department a description of the steps the State proposes to take to 
ensure equitable access to, and participation in, activities conducted 
under Part B of the Act, as required by section 427 of the General 
Education Provisions Act (GEPA).

Section 612(a)(16)(A) of the IDEA and Sec.300.160(a) of these regulations require a state to ensure that all children with disabilities are included in general State and district-wide assessments. Section 612(a)(16)(C)(i) of the IDEA and new Sec.300.160(c) (proposed Sec.300.160(d)) further require that a State (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) develop and implement alternate assessments and guidelines for children with disabilities who cannot participate in regular assessments even with accommodations. Under Sec.Sec.200.1(e) and 200.6(a)(3) of the Title I regulations published in this notice and new Sec.300.160(c), a State has the option of developing alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards. For clarity, we have redesignated proposed Sec.300.160(c) as new Sec.300.160(c)(2)(ii) so that it is clear that an assessment based on modified academic achievement standards is an alternate assessment.

We believe it would impede efforts of school personnel responsible for making a determination as to whether a change in placement for disciplinary purposes is appropriate for a child if the Department attempted to restrict or limit the interpretation of "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case-basis."  Factors such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the violation of a school code could be unique circumstances considered by school personnel when determining whether a disciplinary change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability.  We believe providing school personnel the flexibility to consider whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability on a case-by-case basis and to determine what unique circumstances should be considered regarding a child who violates a code of conduct, as provided for under section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, will limit the inappropriate removal of a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.

We do not believe it is necessary to add an additional requirement that such parental notification be provided in writing, as suggested by several commenters. Parents are integral members of the IEP Team and, as such, are involved in decisions about how their child will participate in the Statewide assessment system. Section 300.320(a)(6)(ii) of the IDEA regulations already provides that, if an IEP Team determines that a child will not participate in a particular regular State or district-wide assessment, the child's IEP must include a statement of why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and how that child will be assessed. Under Sec.300.322(f), a copy of the child's IEP must be provided to the parents.

section 619(g) of the Act to eligible LEAs, including public charter

charter schools that operate as LEAs, have other responsibilities under 
the IDEA that may need to be carried out during the school year, such 
as serving a child with a disability who is identified during the 
school year. It is the Department's position that it is necessary to 
require States to make (rather than give them the option of making)

Likewise, a parent and a public agency can agree that a reevaluation is not necessary.  We believe that in reaching an agreement that a reevaluation is unnecessary, as provided for in Sec. 300.303(b), the parent and public agency will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of conducting a reevaluation, as well as what effect a reevaluation might have on the child's educational program.

It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Department expects the information that a State reports in its annual performance reports and in the public reports on LEA performance will be made available in an understandable and uniform format across the State, including alternative formats upon request, and, to the extent practicable, in a language that parents understand.  We do not believe it is necessary to add a specific requirement to the regulations because other Federal laws and policies already require that information to parents be available in alternative formats and to parents who are limited English proficient.  Specifically, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires SEAs and LEAs to communicate to parents with limited English proficiency what is communicated to parents who are not limited English proficient.  Under Title VI, SEAs and LEAs have flexibility in determining what mix of oral and written translation services may be necessary and reasonable for communicating this information.  Similarly, Executive Order 13166 requires that recipients of Federal financial assistance take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access by individuals with limited English proficiency.  For individuals with disabilities, title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that State and local governments, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that recipients of Federal financial assistance, ensure that their communications with individuals with disabilities are as effective as their communications with others, and that appropriate auxiliary aids and services are available when necessary to ensure effective communication.</span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec.

Assessment of students with disabilities under the IDEA. To ensure a coordinated administration of the IDEA and Title I programs, the final IDEA regulations on assessment in Sec.  300.160, which are included in this regulations package, incorporate provisions regarding modified academic achievement standards that are consistent with the changes to the regulations under Title I of the ESEA. In addition, the final IDEA regulations provide that a State's (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA's) guidelines must require each child to be validly assessed and must identify, for each assessment, accommodations that would result in an invalid score. Consistent with Title I, these final regulations also provide in Sec.  300.160(f)(1) that a student taking an assessment with an accommodation that invalidates the score would not be reported as a participant under the IDEA.

Discussion: The requirements recommended by the commenters are already addressed in these and other existing regulations.

Section 300.320(a)(6), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI) of the IDEA, requires a child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, to include in the IEP any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child on State and district-wide assessments. If the IEP Team determines that a child will take an alternate assessment, the IEP Team must explain why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and why the particular alternate assessment selected is appropriate for the child. Section 300.322(b) requires that the notice to the parent regarding an IEP Team meeting indicate the purpose of the meeting, in addition to the time and location of the meeting. Finally, new Sec.300.160(f) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)) requires that reports on the performance of children with disabilities on State and district-wide assessments be available to the public with the same frequency and in the same detail as reports on the assessment of nondisabled children.

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that the IEP Team (defined 
in Sec.  300.23, which includes the child's parents) plays an important 
role in the special education decision-making process. For example, 
through the development, review and revision of the child's IEP, the 
IEP Team determines how to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. However, the IEP Team does not have the authority to 
consent to the provision of special education and related services to a 
child. That authority is given exclusively to the parent under section 
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act. The Secretary strongly believes that a 
parent also has the authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending 
the provision of special education and related services to their child. 
Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of 
special education and related services at any time is consistent with 
the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's 
rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and 
choice in their child's education.

Modified academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(e) and alternate academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(d) are optional. However, having an alternate assessment is not optional if there are children with disabilities who cannot be appropriately assessed with the regular assessment.

Discussion:  Section 300.226(d), consistent with section 613(f)(4) of the Act, requires LEAs that develop and maintain coordinated, early intervening services to annually report to their SEA on the number of children receiving early intervening services and the number of those children who eventually are identified as children with disabilities and receive special education and related services during the preceding two year period (i.e., the two years after the child has received early intervening services).  We believe that these data are sufficient to provide LEAs and SEAs with the information needed to determine the impact of early intervening services on children and to determine if these services reduce the number of referrals for special education and related services.  Requiring LEAs to collect and report data on the implementation of early intervening services beyond what is specifically required in section 613(f)(4) of the Act is unnecessary and would place additional paperwork burdens on LEAs and SEAs.</span></dd>

Discussion:  It would be over-regulating to specify the specific "reasonable efforts" that a State must take to ensure that a surrogate parent is appointed within the 30-day timeframe required in Sec. 300.519(h), because what is considered a "reasonable effort" will vary on a case-by-case basis.  We do not believe we should require LEAs to report to the State when a child in their district needs a surrogate parent or to require SEAs to track how long it takes LEAs and courts to appoint surrogate parents because to do so would be unnecessarily burdensome.  States have the discretion to determine how best to monitor the timely appointment of surrogate parents by their LEAs.  States also have discretion to use funds reserved for other State-level activities to provide technical assistance to LEAs and courts that fail to meet the 30-day timeframe, as requested by the commenters.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 do account for zero tolerance policies by providing public agencies the flexibility to implement discipline policies as they deem necessary to create safe classrooms and schools for teachers and children as long as those policies are fair and equitable for all children and protect the rights of children with disabilities.  If a child with a disability is removed from his or her current placement and placed in an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspended or expelled under the public agency's zero tolerance policy, the disciplinary requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 apply.  Therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to include language in Sec. 300.536 regarding a public agency's zero tolerance policy as such policies are irrelevant to what constitutes a change in placement for disciplinary removals under the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion: Section 615(h)(1) of the Act is clear that parties to a 
due process hearing may be ``accompanied and advised'' by counsel and 
by individuals, such as non-attorney advocates, who have special 
knowledge or training regarding the problems of children with 
disabilities. Nothing in these regulations or State law can limit this 
right. However, neither the Act nor the current regulations 
implementing Part B of the Act address the issue of whether individuals 
who are not attorneys, but have special knowledge or training regarding 
the problems of children with disabilities, may ``represent'' parties 
in due process hearings under the Act. Congress considered the question 
of non-attorney representation during the 2003-2004 IDEA 
reauthorization process. The version of H.R. 1350 passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2003 included a provision giving a party the 
``right to be represented by counsel and by non-attorney advocates and 
to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or 
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities'' 
(63 Cong. Rec. H3458 and H3495 (daily ed. Apr. 30, 2003)). The final 
version of the bill enacted in 2004, however, did not adopt this 
language. In other areas, though, the Act, as revised in 2004, now 
specifically addresses duties applicable to ``either party, or the 
attorney representing a party'' (see section 615(b)(7)(A) and (B) of 
the Act). Given that the Act is silent regarding the representational 
role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of 
whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties to a due process 
hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to 
decide. As the commenter notes, even if a State law prohibits non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, the Act still affords 
parties to due process hearings the right to be accompanied and advised 
by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
problems of children with disabilities.

Comment: A number of commenters stated that the issue of whether to 
allow parents to be represented by non-lawyers in IDEA due process 
hearings should be left to Congress to resolve. Many of these 
commenters stated that given the pending reauthorization of the Act, 
regulating on this topic is premature. Some commenters stated that this 
issue should be reviewed in Congressional oversight hearings. Many 
commenters argued that there is a need for review and consideration of 
available research data, or that research should first be conducted on 
the special education administrative due process systems of States and 
districts, before a change is made. Others called for research on the 
availability of legal representation for parents in due process 
hearings before a change in the Department's policy is made.
Discussion: We disagree with commenters that this matter should be 
left to Congress to resolve or that it is premature to address this 
issue given the pending reauthorization of the Act. Participants in due 
process hearings should understand that, under the current state of the 
law, the Act does not prohibit States from determining whether parties 
to due process hearings can be represented in those hearings by non-
attorneys. We also disagree with commenters that additional research is 
needed to better understand the current state of State law on this 
issue before amending Sec.  300.512. That said, we agree that 
additional information about the availability of legal representation 
for parties might be useful in helping Congress decide whether a change 
in the statute is advisable.

Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations because, in light of the Department's longstanding position that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of disciplinary removals that constitute a pattern, we believe requiring the public agency to carefully review the child's previous behaviors to determine whether the behaviors, taken cumulatively, are substantially similar is an important step in determining whether a series of removals of a child constitutes a change in placement, and is necessary to ensure that public agencies appropriately apply the change in placement provisions.  Whether the behavior in the incidents that resulted in the series of removals is "substantially similar" should be made on a case-by-case basis and include consideration of any relevant information regarding the child's behaviors, including, where appropriate, any information in the child's IEP.  However, we do not believe it is appropriate to require in these regulations that the "substantially similar behaviors" be recognized by the IEP Team or included in the child's IEP as recommended by the commenter.  The commenter is correct that what constitutes "substantially similar behavior" is a subjective determination.  However, we believe that when the child's behaviors, taken cumulatively, are objectively reviewed in the context of all the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for determining whether the series of behaviors constitutes a change in placement, the public agency will be able to make a reasonable determination as to whether a change in placement has occurred.  Of course, if the parent disagrees with the determination by the public agency, the parent may request a due process hearing pursuant to Sec. 300.532.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Under section 612(a) of the Act, States must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for a grant under the Part B program.  Under section 612(d) of the Act, if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a final determination that a State is not eligible for a grant, the Secretary may not award funds to the State.  The procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 detail the process through which the Secretary notifies a State of a proposed ineligibility determination, the hearing available to the State to dispute this proposal, and the process through which the Secretary makes a final determination.  The Secretary's final determination may be appealed through the judicial review procedure described in section 616(e)(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.184.  We decline to address this issue more specifically in the regulations, however, as we think the regulations already adequately convey the idea that only States that the Secretary determines to be eligible can receive a grant.</span></dd>

Discussion: Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the IDEA requires benchmarks or short-term objectives to be included only in the IEPs of children with disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. Alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards are not alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. Therefore, we do not believe that benchmarks or short-term objectives should be required for children with disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards. Congress specifically limited the requirement for benchmarks and short-term objectives to the IEPs of children with the most significant cognitive disabilities who participate in alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards. As the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions noted in Sen. Rep. No. 108-185 (p. 28), ``Short-term objectives and benchmarks can focus too much on minor details and distract from the real purpose of special education, which is to ensure that all children and youth with disabilities achieve high educational outcomes and are prepared to participate fully in the social and economic fabric of their communities.''

Discussion: If a parent who revoked consent for special education 
and related services later requests that his or her child be re-
enrolled in special education, an LEA must treat this request as a 
request for an initial evaluation under Sec.  300.301 (rather than a 
reevaluation under Sec.  300.303). However, depending on the data 
available, a new evaluation may not always be required. An initial 
evaluation, under Sec.  300.305, requires a review of existing 
evaluation data that includes classroom based, local, or State 
assessments, and classroom based observations by teachers and related 
services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the 
child's parents, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether 
the child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec.  300.8, and 
the educational needs of the child. Therefore, a public agency may not 
always have to expend resources on a ``new'' initial evaluation.

We urge LEAs and parents to act cooperatively in determining who will attend the resolution meeting, as a resolution meeting is unlikely to result in any resolution of the dispute if the parties cannot even agree on who should attend.

Discussion:  We do not believe a specific timeline for an expedited evaluation or an eligibility determination should be included in these regulations.  What may be required to conduct an evaluation will vary widely depending on the nature and extent of a child's suspected disability and the amount of additional information that would be necessary to make an eligibility determination.  However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.  (See section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act).  Further, we believe it would be inappropriate to specify the timeframe from the completion of an evaluation to the determination of eligibility when there is no specific statutory basis to do so.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of social work services in schools includes examples of the types of social work services that may be provided.  It is not a prescriptive or exhaustive list.  The child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether a child needs social work services, and what specific social work services are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is necessary to include functional behavioral assessments in the definition of social work services in schools because providing positive behavioral intervention strategies is just an example of a social work service that might be provided to a child if the child's IEP Team determines that such services are needed for the child to receive FAPE.  Similarly, if a child's IEP Team determines that mobilizing community resources would not be an effective means of enabling the child to learn as effectively as possible because there are no community resources to address the needs of the child, the IEP Team would need to consider other ways to meet the child's needs.  While there is the possibility that a due process hearing might be filed based on a failure to mobilize community resources that do not exist, we do not believe that such a claim could ever be successful, as the regulation does not require the creation of community resources that do not exist.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The criteria for selecting surrogate parents in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), which apply to surrogate parents appointed by a public agency for children with disabilities under Part B of the Act, do not apply to the selection of surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State under the laws of the State.  Section 615(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act provides that, in the case of a child who is a ward of the State, a surrogate parent may alternatively be appointed by the judge overseeing the child's care, provided that the surrogate parent is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the child.  We decline to impose additional requirements for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State beyond what is required in the Act, so as to interfere as little as possible with State practice in appointing individuals to act for the child.

Discussion:  Section 300.135, regarding written affirmation, tracks the language in section 612(a)(10)(A)(iv) of the Act.  Including a requirement in the regulations that the LEA must submit a copy of signed written affirmations to the SEA would place reporting burdens on the LEA that are not required by the Act and that we do not believe are warranted in this circumstance.  We expect that in most circumstances private school officials and LEAs will have cooperative relationships that will not need State involvement.  If private school officials believe that there was not meaningful consultation, they may raise that issue with the SEA through the procedures in Sec. 300.136.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude a State from requiring LEAs to submit a copy of the written affirmation obtained pursuant to Sec. 300.135, in meeting its general supervision responsibilities under Sec. 300.149 or as a part of its monitoring of LEAs' implementation of Part B of the Act as required in Sec. 300.600.

Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

The purpose of the State advisory panel, as stated in Sec. 300.167 and section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, is to provide policy guidance to the SEA with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.168 and section 612(a)(21)(B) of the Act, a broad membership is required.  The duties of the panel are, among other things, to advise the SEA on unmet needs, evaluations, and corrective action plans to address findings identified in Federal monitoring reports, consistent with Sec. 300.169 and section 612(a)(21)(D) of the Act.  However, although we believe that broad stakeholder involvement in the development of the State performance plans and annual performance reports is very important, we decline to regulate that a specific group be involved in their development.  We have, however, provided guidance in OSEP's August 9, 2005 memorandum to States, Submission of Part B State Performance Plans and Annual Performance Reports, (OSEP Memo 05-12), located at http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/bapr/index.html, which directs States to provide information in their State performance plans on how they obtained broad input from stakeholders on the State performance plan.  Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to add any further clarification in Sec. 300.600.  </span></dd>

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of 
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under 
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for 
services under Part B of the Act.

Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive 
special education and related services, the child is considered a 
general education student and will be considered a general education 
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after 
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State 
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general 
education student who has exited special education for accountability 
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to 
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores 
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the 
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the 
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for 
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a 
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related 
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating 
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the 
State may continue to include the child in the students with 
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two 
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no 
longer be required under the IDEA to provide accommodations that were 
previously included in the child's IEP.

Comment:  Many commenters requested clarifying the phrase "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" in Sec. 300.530(a) and what, if any, unique circumstances should be considered.  A few of these commenters requested that the regulations include specific criteria to be used when making a case-by-case determination.  Other commenters suggested clarifying that the purpose of a case-by-case determination is to not allow school personnel to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting for violating a code of student conduct when to do so would seem unjust under the circumstances.  Some commenters suggested clarifying that the purpose of a case-by-case determination is to limit, not expand, disciplinary actions for a child with a disability.  One commenter expressed concern that permitting school personnel to consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining a change in placement may result in schools applying this provision to cases for which it was not intended, potentially resulting in a denial of FAPE.  Other commenters requested clarifying that a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, and expression of remorse should be factors considered when making a case-by-case determination.  A few commenters requested school personnel document any supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the child's violation of a code of student behavior when making a case-by-case determination.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.148(b) that a parental placement does not need to meet State standards in order to be "appropriate" under the Act is retained from current Sec. 300.402(c) to be consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985) (Burlington) and Florence County School District Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (Carter).  Under the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, a court may order reimbursement for a parent who unilaterally withdraws his or her child from a public school that provides an inappropriate education under the Act and enrolls the child in a private school that provides an education that is otherwise proper under the Act, but does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.  The Court noted that these standards apply only to public agencies' own programs for educating children with disabilities and to public agency placements of children with disabilities in private schools for the purpose of providing a program of special education and related services.  The Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Burlington that tuition reimbursement is only available if a Federal court concludes "both that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school placement was proper under the Act."  (510 U.S. at 12).  We believe LEAs can avoid reimbursement awards by offering and providing FAPE consistent with the Act either in public schools or in private schools in which the parent places the child.  However, a decision as to whether an LEA's offer or provision of FAPE was proper under the Act and any decision regarding reimbursement must be made by a court or hearing officer.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in these regulations a provision relieving a public agency of its obligation to provide tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement in a private school if the child did not first receive special education and related services from the LEA.</span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Because of the high cost of due process hearings and the low expected cost of conducting a resolution meeting, there would likely be some savings for all parties involved if resolution meetings were relatively successful in resolving disagreements.  For example, California reports an average cost of $18,600 for a due process hearing, while Texas reports having spent an average of $9,000 for a hearing officer's services.  Anticipating that attorneys will participate in approximately 40 percent of the predicted 3,985 resolution meetings (including drafting legally binding agreements when parties reach agreement), we expect resolution meetings to cost just over twice the average cost of IEP Team meetings, or approximately $700 per meeting.  Even with a very low success rate (eight percent), given the expected costs of these meetings compared to the high cost of conducting a hearing, all parties involved would likely realize some modest savings.  However, because disputes that result in formal hearings tend to be the most difficult to resolve, we do not expect that mandatory resolution meetings will be highly successful in resolving such cases.  By definition, these are cases in which the parties are not amenable to using existing alternatives to formal hearings such as mediation.  Moreover, assuming an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000 per due process hearing, even if as many as 20 percent of the 3,985 complaints were successfully resolved through resolution meetings, net savings still would not exceed $10 million.  (Note that it is unclear to what extent data on average mediation and due process hearing costs account for LEA opportunity costs (e.g., cost per teacher and/or administrator participating).  To the extent that these data do not reflect the opportunity costs of participating LEA officials and staff, we have overestimated the potential savings from resolution meetings). </span></dd>

Discussion: Tests administered with accommodations that do not maintain test validity are not measuring academic achievement and functional performance. Therefore, providing these accommodations would be inconsistent with Sec.  300.320(a)(6)(i) and section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(aa) of the IDEA, which require each IEP to include the appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic and functional performance of a child on State and district-wide assessments. With regard to the recommendation that a State focus on universally designed assessments, new Sec.  300.160(g) (proposed Sec.  300.160(f)) already incorporates the requirement in section 612(a)(16)(E) of the IDEA that a State, in the case of Statewide assessments, and an LEA, in the case of district-wide assessments, to the extent possible, use universal design in developing and implementing assessments. Moreover, Sec.  200.2(b)(2) of the Title I regulations requires a State's assessment system to ``[b]e designed to be valid and accessible for use by the widest possible range of students, including students with disabilities.''

With regard to the request to clarify whether alternate assessments are based on high achievement standards or alternate academic achievement standards, this will depend on the type of alternate assessment. We believe that the regulations are clear that there are three types of alternate assessments permitted under Title I and the IDEA: alternate assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards; Alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards; and alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards.

For State and LEA assessments that are not part of a State's assessment system under Title I of the ESEA, a State and its LEAs also have an obligation, under the IDEA, to ensure that children with disabilities have available the accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child. In order to do this, States and LEAs need to determine, for each particular assessment, the accommodations that will not result in invalid scores and identify those accommodations in their accommodation guidelines. We have revised Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(i) to make this clear.

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that the regulations do not provide sufficient guidance on what school personnel can communicate to parents regarding medication.  The commenters stated that in the absence of additional guidance, the regulations have the unintended effect of preventing school personnel from speaking openly with parents regarding classroom behavior, options for addressing behavior problems, and the impact of a child's medication on classroom behavior.  Further, the commenters requested that the regulations do more to encourage school personnel to recommend evaluations for children with behavior problems and communicate openly with parents about the effectiveness of treatment, and protect school personnel.

Discussion:  We understand the commenters' concern that a parent of a child with a disability who refuses to consent to the provision of special education and related services may not fully understand the extent of the special education and related services their child would receive without the development of an IEP for their child.  However, we do not view the consent provisions of the Act as creating the right of parents to consent to each specific special education and related service that their child receives.  Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.  "Fully informed," in this context, means that a parent has been given an explanation of what special education and related services are and the types of services that might be found to be needed for their child, rather than the exact program of services that would be included in an IEP.  </span></dd>

Comment: Several commenters requested that we change the public 
reporting timeline in proposed Sec.  300.602(b)(1)(i)(A). Some of these 
commenters argued that the Secretary does not have the statutory 
authority to establish a timeline and that meeting the timeline would 
be an excessive burden on States. Other commenters agreed with the 
concept of a timeline and offered suggestions as to what the timeline 
should be. Some commenters suggested that the regulations allow for 
State-determined timelines; others recommended timelines ranging from 
90 to 120 days following a State's submission of its APR to the 
Secretary; still others recommended a 60 day timeline beginning with a 
State's receipt of its annual determination from the Secretary. 
Commenters stated that a State-determined timeline or a timeline 
triggered by the State's receipt of it annual determination from the 
Secretary would allow for a more careful analysis of individual LEA 
data, thereby ensuring more accurate public reporting on the 
performance of each LEA.

We have minimal data on the number of manifestation determination reviews being conducted.  However, State-reported data for the 2002-2003 school year suggest that schools are conducting a relatively small number of manifestation reviews.  According to these data, for every 1,000 children with disabilities, approximately 11 will be suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days during the school year (either through a single suspension or as a result of multiple short-term suspensions)--the disciplinary action triggering a manifestation review.  (Please note that we have no way of accurately estimating what portion of short-term suspensions that add up to 10 days would be determined by school personnel to constitute a change in placement.  Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this analysis, that 100 percent of these instances would require a manifestation review because they would be deemed a change in placement).  Based on a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we assume that under previous law at least 85 percent of manifestation reviews resulted in disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspensions or expulsion).  In other words, approximately 15 percent of all manifestation reviews did not result in disciplinary action because the behavior in question was determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  It is not necessary to include a definition of "functional" in these regulations because we believe it is a term that is generally understood to refer to skills or activities that are not considered academic or related to a child's academic achievement.  Instead, "functional" is often used in the context of routine activities of everyday living.  We do not believe it is necessary to include examples of functional skills in the regulations because the range of functional skills is as varied as the individual needs of children with disabilities.  We also decline to include examples of how functional skills are measured because this is a decision that is best left to public agencies, based on the needs of their children.  However, it should be noted that the evaluation procedures used to measure a child's functional skills must meet the same standards as all other evaluation procedures, consistent with Sec. 300.304(c)(1).  </span></dd>

	We also believe it is important to be clear about the confidentiality requirements for children who are placed in private schools by their parents, given the significant change in the child find requirements for these children.  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, child find for these children now is the responsibility of the LEA in which the private school is located and not the child's LEA of residence.  We can anticipate situations in which there may be requests for information to be exchanged between the two LEAs, such as when a child is evaluated and identified as a child with a disability by the LEA in which the private school is located and the child subsequently returns to public school in the LEA of residence.  We believe under such circumstances parental consent should be required before personally identifiable information is released between officials of the LEA where a private school is located and the LEA of the parent's residence.  We believe that consent is important in these situations to protect the privacy of the child and the child's family.

Discussion: As used in Sec.300.160(a), a ``valid'' accommodation is an accommodation that does not alter the construct that the test is intended to measure. Accommodations that affect test validity do not measure a child's academic achievement. We believe the requirement for valid accommodations is sufficient to guide IEP Teams and, therefore, decline to add the suggested language to the regulation.

On the question of when a person is "new to the profession," the Department's non-regulatory guidance on Improving Teacher Quality State Grants issued on August 3, 2005, clarifies that States have the authority to define which teachers are new and not new to the profession; however, those definitions must be reasonable.  The guidance further states that the Department strongly believes that a teacher with less than one year of teaching experience is "new" to the profession (see Question A-6).  (The guidance is available at http://www.ed.gov/programs/teacherqual/guidance.doc).  This guidance is applicable to determinations of when a person is new or not new to the profession under section 602(10)(C) and (D)(ii) of the Act and Sec. 300.18(c) and (d)(2).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 615(b)(2) of the Act does not require the automatic appointment of a surrogate parent for every child with a disability who is a ward of the State.  States and LEAs must ensure that the rights of these children are protected and that a surrogate parent is appointed, if necessary, as provided in Sec. 300.519(b)(1).  If a child who is a ward of the State already has a person who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30, and that person is willing and able to assume the responsibilities of a parent under the Act, a surrogate parent might not be needed.  Accordingly, we do not believe it is necessary to make the changes suggested by the commenters.</span></dd>

The definition also clarifies that for individuals with deafness or blindness, or for individuals with no written language, the native language is the mode of communication that is normally used by the individual (such as sign language, Braille, or oral communication).

Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language clarifying that waiving three-year reevaluations must not be a routine agency policy or practice because the regulations are clear that this is a decision that is made individually for each child by the parent of the child and the public agency.  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  When a parent and a public agency agree that a three-year reevaluation is unnecessary, there is no requirement that the public agency offer the parent a reevaluation each year.  We do not believe that it is necessary to have such a requirement because if parents who have waived a three year reevaluation later decide to request an evaluation, they can do so.  Also, public agencies have a continuing responsibility to request parental consent for a reevaluation if they determine that the child's educational or related services needs warrant a reevaluation.</span></dd>

The revised manifestation provisions in section 615 of the Act provide a simplified, common sense manifestation determination process that could be used by school personnel.

Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

We believe it is unnecessary to repeat these exclusions in the definition of assistive technology service.</span></dd>

Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act that would prevent a temporary surrogate parent from having all the rights of a parent.  Note 89 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 35810, provides that appropriate staff members of emergency shelters, transitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach programs would not be considered to be employees of agencies involved in the education or care of unaccompanied youth (and thus prohibited from serving as a surrogate parent), provided that such a role is temporary until a surrogate parent can be appointed who meets the requirements for a surrogate parent in Sec. 300.519(d).

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter that allowing a parent 
to revoke consent for special education and related services is 
inconsistent with the requirements in section 614(c)(5) of the Act. 
Section 614(c)(5) of the Act requires that an LEA evaluate a child 
before determining that the child is no longer a child with a 
disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in question and 
the LEA believes the child may no longer be eligible for special 
education services. Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent to revoke 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services and does not trigger an LEA's obligation to conduct an 
evaluation for a child that is receiving services before determining 
that a child is no longer a child with a disability. If a parent 
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services for his or her child, the public agency is not 
determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability as 
contemplated by section 614(c)(5) of the Act and Sec.  300.305(e). 
Instead, the public agency is discontinuing the provision of special 
education and related services pursuant to the decision of the parent 
and there is no obligation for the LEA to evaluate the child.

Discussion:  Section 300.301(d) follows the specific language in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act.  We do not believe it is appropriate or reasonable to define "repeatedly fails" or "refuses to produce" because the meaning of these phrases will vary depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  For example, situations in which a child is absent on the days the evaluation is scheduled because the child is ill would be treated differently than if a parent repeatedly fails to keep scheduled appointments.  Similarly, situations in which a parent fails to keep scheduled appointments when a public agency repeatedly schedules the evaluation to accommodate the parent's schedule would be treated differently than situations in which a public agency makes no attempt to accommodate a parent's schedule.  </span></dd>

The Department does not intend to dictate how extensive the research must be or who, within an LEA or State, should determine that the research is of high quality.

We agree with the commenters' recommendation and believe retaining current Sec. 300.342(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) is necessary to ensure proper implementation of the child's IEP and the provision of FAPE to the child.  However, the mechanism that the public agency uses to inform each teacher or provider of his or her responsibilities is best left to the discretion of the public agency.  </span></dd>

In addition, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting.

Since decisions about whether a particular accommodation is or is not allowed depend on how a test is constructed and validated, we are not making the requested change. As required by Sec.Sec.200.2(b)(2) and 200.6(a)(1), a State already is under the obligation to ensure that its assessments under Title I of the ESEA are designed to be used by the widest possible number of students, and to ensure that accommodations are provided, when necessary, to measure the academic achievement of students with disabilities.

In such a case, the SEA is responsible for ensuring that the entire cost of that child's placement, including the therapeutic care as well as room and board, is without cost to the parents.

For services that are not necessary to provide access to education by maintaining the health or safety of the child while in school, the distinguishing factor between those services that are not covered under the Act, such as mapping, and those that are covered, such as verifying that a cochlear implant is functioning properly, in large measure, is the level of expertise required.  The maintenance and monitoring of surgically implanted devices require the expertise of a licensed physician or an individual with specialized technical expertise beyond that typically available from school personnel.  On the other hand, trained lay persons or nurses can routinely check an externally worn processor connected with a surgically implanted device to determine if the batteries are charged and the external processor is operating.  (As discussed below, the Act does require public agencies to provide those services that are otherwise related services and are necessary to maintain a child's health or safety in school even if those services require specialized training.)  Teachers and related services providers can be taught to first check the externally worn speech processor to make sure it is turned on, the volume and sensitivity settings are correct, and the cable is connected, in much the same manner as they are taught to make sure a hearing aid is properly functioning.  To allow a child to sit in a classroom when the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant is not functioning is to effectively exclude the child from receiving an appropriate education.  Therefore, we believe it is important to clarify that a public agency is responsible for the routine checking of the external components of a surgically implanted device in much the same manner as a public agency is responsible for the proper functioning of hearing aids.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </span></dd>

Therefore, a child who is not deaf or hard of hearing, but who is without expressive speech, would not be considered eligible to receive interpreting services as defined in Sec. 300.34(c)(4).  However, such a child could be considered eligible for speech-language pathology services, consistent with Sec. 300.34(c)(15).</span></dd>

If, however, the parent chooses to share the evaluation with the public agency, that evaluation may be presented by any party as evidence in a due process hearing, in accordance with Sec. 300.502(c)(2).  Similarly, if a public agency reimburses a parent for an IEE, and the parent disagrees with the results of the IEE, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from introducing that evaluation in a due process hearing over the parent's objection.  We disagree with the commenters to the extent that they believe that parents should have an expectation of privacy regarding an evaluation that is publicly-funded or for which they seek public funding.

When the behavior is related to the child's disability, proper development of the child's IEP should include development of strategies, including positive behavioral interventions, supports, and other strategies to address that behavior, consistent with Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i).

	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The changes requested by the commenter cannot be made because they are inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.111(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act, explicitly requires that all children with disabilities residing in the State are identified, located, and evaluated.  This includes children suspected of having developmental delays, as defined in section 602(3)(B) of the Act.  We recognize that it is difficult to locate, identify, and evaluate highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities.  However, we strongly believe it is important to stress in these regulations that the States' child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 apply equally to such children.  We also believe it is important to clarify that a child suspected of having a disability but who has not failed, is making academic progress, and is passing from grade to grade must be considered in the child find process as any other child suspected of having a disability.  As noted earlier in the discussion regarding Sec. 300.101, paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 300.111 has been revised to clarify that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.  The Act is clear that the public agency must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Discussion: It is inappropriate for school personnel to encourage a 
parent to revoke consent for special education and related services. If 
school personnel believe a child no longer qualifies as a child with a 
disability, Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations provide 
a process for making that determination. Specifically Sec.  300.305(e), 
consistent with section 614(c)(5) of the Act, requires that an LEA 
evaluate a child before determining that the child is no longer a child 
with a disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in 
question and an LEA believes a child may no longer be eligible for 
special education services. A public agency must follow this long-
standing procedure if the agency believes a child should no longer 
receive special education and related services.

education and related services. Similarly, we do not agree with the

previously received special education and related services. States are 
required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure effective 
child find. Ensuring that general education teachers make appropriate

Discussion:  We believe that one of the most important aspects of good teaching is the ability to determine when a child is learning and then to tailor instruction to meet the child's individual needs.  Effective teachers use data to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of a particular instructional strategy or program.  A critical hallmark of appropriate instruction is that data documenting a child's progress are systematically collected and analyzed and that parents are kept informed of the child's progress.  Assessments of a child's progress are not bureaucratic, but an essential component of good instruction.</span></dd>

Beyond those savings to all parties resulting from reductions in the total number of formal hearings, we also expect some additional savings to result from parties agreeing to participate in resolution meetings instead of mediation, particularly if the resolution meetings are as effective as mediation in resolving disagreements.  However, unlike due process hearings, the expected cost of conducting a resolution meeting ($700 per meeting) is only somewhat less than the cost of a mediation session (between $600 and $1,800 per session).  Because the cost differential between resolution meetings and mediations is relatively small (compared to the difference in cost between resolution meetings and due process hearings) the potential for savings generated by parties agreeing to resolution meetings instead of mediation is minimal. </span></dd>

One commenter requested that the regulations clarify that a special education teacher who is certified as a regular education teacher with an endorsement in special education meets the requirements for a highly qualified special education teacher.  Another commenter recommended changing the definition of a highly qualified special education teacher so that States cannot provide a single certification for all areas of special education.  One commenter requested clarification regarding the highly qualified special education teacher standards for special education teachers with single State endorsements in the area of special education.  A few commenters recommended clarifying that when a State determines that a teacher is fully certified in special education, this means that the teacher is knowledgeable and skilled in the special education area in which certification is received.

Discussion:  Section 300.18(c)(2) requires that if a teacher (who is teaching exclusively to alternate achievement standards) is teaching students who need instruction above the elementary school level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to effectively teach to those standards.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that teachers exclusively teaching children who are assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards above the elementary level have sufficient subject matter knowledge to effectively instruct in each of the core academic subjects being taught, at the level of difficulty being taught.  For example, if a high school student (determined by the IEP Team to be assessed against alternate achievement standards) has knowledge and skills in math at the 7th grade level, but in all other areas functions at the elementary level, the teacher would need to have knowledge in 7th grade math in order to effectively teach the student to meet the 7th grade math standards.  No further clarification is necessary.</span></dd>

Comment:  Some commenters agreed with new Sec. 300.18(h) (proposed Sec. 300.18(g)), which states that the highly qualified special education teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  However, many commenters disagreed, stating that children placed by an LEA in a private school are entitled to receive the same high quality instruction as special education children in public schools.  A few commenters stated that LEAs will place children in private schools to avoid hiring highly qualified teachers.  Some commenters stated that public funds should not be used for any school that is not held to the same high standards as public schools.  Other commenters stated that children with the most significant disabilities who are placed in private schools are children with the most need for highly qualified teachers.  A few commenters stated that this provision is contrary to the intent of the ESEA and the Act to support the educational achievement of children with disabilities.  Other commenters stated that if instruction by a highly qualified teacher is a hallmark of FAPE, it should be an element of FAPE in any educational setting in which the child is enrolled by a public agency.</span></dd>

Comment:  Several commenters expressed support for the requirements in Sec. 300.309(a)(1) and stated that the first element of determining eligibility for an SLD is a finding that the child does not achieve commensurate with the child's age in one or more of the eight areas when provided with learning experiences appropriate to the child's age.

Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 615(c)(2)(D) and (E) of the Act, respectively, address situations where it is necessary for hearing officers to make determinations regarding the sufficiency of a complaint and amendments to a complaint before a due process hearing.

The specific application of those procedures to particular cases generally should be left to the discretion of hearing officers who have the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with standard legal practice.

Discussion:  We believe it is important to retain these requirements in Sec. 300.323(b)(2) because of the importance of the IEP as the statutory vehicle for ensuring FAPE to a child with a disability.  Although the Act does not specifically require a public agency to provide detailed explanations to the parent of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP, we believe parents need this information to make an informed choice regarding whether to continue to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP.  Parents, for example, should understand that it is through the IEP that the child is entitled to the special education and related services that the child's IEP Team determines are necessary to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and to receive FAPE.  If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.  For a parent to waive the right to an IEP, informed parental consent is necessary.  </span></dd>

	When an IEP Team member's area is being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(2), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires the LEA and the parent to provide written informed consent.  Consistent with Sec. 300.9, consent means that the parent has been fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, and understands that the granting of consent is voluntary and may be revoked at any time.  The LEA must, therefore, provide the parent with appropriate and sufficient information to ensure that the parent fully understands that the parent is consenting to excuse an IEP Team member from attending an IEP Team meeting in which the member's area of the curriculum or related services is being changed or discussed and that if the parent does not consent the IEP Team meeting must be held with that IEP Team member in attendance.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act now makes the resolution process a prerequisite to an impartial due process hearing.  Under section 615(j) of the Act, a child must be maintained in the current educational placement while proceedings under the Act are pending, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.518 clarifies that unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current educational placement during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507.  Thus, the Act is clear that the public agency must maintain the child's current educational placement during the pendency of the 30-day resolution process, which is triggered once the parent files a due process complaint under this part, regardless of whether the due process complaint is resolved prior to a due process hearing.  We believe it is important for this to be clear in the procedural safeguards notice.  Therefore, we are changing Sec. 300.504(c)(7) to clarify that the notice must inform parents about the child's placement during the pendency of any due process complaint.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.532(c)(3)(i) clearly states that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of a public agency's receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint.  It is not expected that parties will necessarily reach agreement during the resolution meeting; the parties often need time to consider the resolution options offered at the meeting.  The intent of Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(ii) is to allow parties sufficient time to consider the resolution options discussed in the resolution meeting.  However, if the parties do not reach agreement within 15 days of receipt of the parent's due process complaint, the expedited hearing may proceed and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) commence.  Lack of parent participation in the resolution meeting would be addressed the same way it is in a regular due process hearing under Sec. 300.510(b), except that the timeframes will differ.

Discussion:  The concept of burden of proof is not applicable to the manifestation determination, which does not occur in a hearing under the Act.  Under Sec. 300.530(e), the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) are responsible for determining whether the child's behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability, by conducting a fair inquiry into the issues posed by Sec. 300.530(e)(1)(i) and (ii).  If the parent disagrees with the manifestation determination, they have the right to appeal that decision by requesting a due process hearing under Sec. 300.532.  At the point a due process hearing is requested, the concept of burden of proof would be applicable.

Discussion:  The base year that applies to section 611 of the Act is not the same as the base year that applies to section 619 of the Act.  The formula for allocating funds to LEAs under sections 611 and 619 of the Act is based on the amount of program funds received in a prior year (the base year), the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction, and the relative numbers of children living in poverty.  Under section 619(g)(1)(A) of the Act, the base year for allocating section 619 funds to LEAs under the Preschool Grant program is Federal fiscal year (FFY) 1997.  Under section 611(f)(2)(A) of the Act, the base year for allocating section 611 funds to LEAs under the Grants to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities Program is FFY 1999.  </span></dd>

Discussion: Section 300.602(b)(1)(i)(A) implements section 
616(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act. Although the Act is silent on the 
timeline for public reporting, section 607(a) of the Act provides that 
the Secretary shall issue regulations to the extent that such 
regulations are necessary to ensure that there is compliance with 
specific requirements of the Act. We proposed a timeline for public 
reporting in the NPRM because there was uncertainty in the field about 
reporting requirements. Specifically, following the publication of the 
Part B regulations in 2006, the Department received many informal 
inquiries from SEA personnel and other interested parties regarding the 
timeline for reporting information to the public about LEAs' 
performance relative to its State's targets. It is still the 
Department's position, after consideration of the comments, that 
establishing a definitive timeline is necessary to ensure that each 
State provides timely information to the public.

<dd><span class="contentText">
As part of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.604, States must report annually on indicators in three monitoring priority areas.  One of the monitoring priority areas is disproportionality, for which there are two indicators.  In addition to annually reviewing State performance on each indicator in each monitoring priority area, the State must review each LEA against indicators established for each monitoring priority area, so the State will be examining data annually to identify any disproportionality.  If disproportionality is identified in LEAs, the policies, procedures, and practices of the LEAs will be examined to determine if they are leading to inappropriate identification, and, pursuant to section 618(d)(2)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.646(b)(3), the LEA will be required to report publicly on the revision of policies, practices, and procedures used in identification or placement.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to add a requirement that LEAs monitor the effect of early intervening services on disproportionality because the LEAS will have to continue to publicly report on their revision of policies, practices and procedures until the significant disproportionality in the LEA is eliminated.  We believe that the intent of the suggestion will be accomplished through this other requirement.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The reporting requirements in Sec. 300.641(c) are not new.  Section 300.641(c) is the same as current Sec. 300.751(e); State reporting policies therefore should already be consistent with these regulations.  Section 300.641(d) addresses how States must report a child with a disability who has more than one disability for purposes of the annual report of children served under the Act.  Paragraph (d)(1) states that if a child has only two disabilities and those disabilities are deafness and blindness, and the child is not reported as having a developmental delay, that child must be reported under the category of deaf-blindness.  Paragraph (d)(2) states that if a child has more than one disability and is not reported as having deaf-blindness or as having a developmental delay, the child must be reported under the category of multiple disabilities.  We believe that Sec. 300.641(d) is clear that children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability must be included in the category of multiple disabilities.  To designate deaf-blindness as the primary disability and include children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability in the category of deaf-blindness would be inconsistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.641(d).  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
We understand the commenter's concern that this change in the 
regulations may require States to revise their procedures for 
distributing Part B funds, and that there may be some administrative 
burden associated with these changes. However, the importance of 
ensuring consistency across States concerning the distribution of 
section 611 and section 619 funds outweighs the potential 
administrative burden. As previously stated in this preamble, making 
these funds available to LEAs is critical to ensure that each LEA is 
able to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act. We agree with 
commenters that some States have been successful in ensuring small LEAs 
receive allocations when they enroll students with disabilities after 
the school year has begun. However, given that the Act and the 
implementing regulations are silent on whether an SEA must make a 
subgrant to an LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, 
clarification is necessary in Sec. Sec.  300.705(a) and 300.815 to 
remove any ambiguity in this regard. Revising the regulations, rather 
than remaining silent on the issue or issuing guidance, will ensure 
that all States treat LEAs in the same manner, including those LEAs 
that are not serving any children with disabilities, when allocating 
Part B funds.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to further clarify that the LEA is ultimately responsible for providing services because Sec. 300.154(b)(2) sufficiently requires that if a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for the special education and related services in Sec. 300.154(b)(1), the LEA or State agency responsible for developing the child's IEP must provide or pay for these services to the child in a timely manner.  Disagreements about the interagency agreements should not stop or delay the receipt of the services described in the child's IEP.  Section 300.103(c) also addresses timely services and clarifies that, consistent with Sec. 300.323(c), the State must ensure there is no delay in implementing a child's IEP, including any situation in which the source for providing or paying for the special education or related services to a child is being determined.  Section 612(a)(12)(A)(i) of the Act provides that the financial responsibility of public agencies (other than an educational agency), including Medicaid and other public insurers obligated under Federal or State law or assigned responsibility under State policy, must precede financial responsibility of the LEA.  </span></dd>

In addition, a parent always has the right to file a due process complaint and request a due process hearing on any matter concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of his or her child, or the provision of FAPE and may seek to resolve their disputes through mediation.  It is important to clarify that when the parent files both a due process complaint and a State complaint on the same issue, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.  However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152, including using the time limit and procedures in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 300.152.

Discussion:  We believe that Sec. 300.102(a)(3) is sufficiently clear that public agencies need not make FAPE available to children with disabilities who have graduated with a regular high school diploma and that no change is needed to the regulations.  Children with disabilities who have not graduated with a regular high school diploma still have an entitlement to FAPE until the child reaches the age at which eligibility ceases under the age requirements within the State.  However, we have reviewed the regulations and believe that it is important for these regulations to define "regular diploma" consistent with the ESEA regulations in 34 CFR Sec. 200.19(a)(1)(i).  Therefore, we will add language to clarify that a regular high school diploma does not include an alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the State's academic standards, such as a certificate or general educational development (GED) credential.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the definition of travel training already acknowledges the importance of transportation in supporting children with disabilities to fully participate in their communities.  New Sec. 300.43(a)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.42(a)(4)) defines travel training to include providing instruction that enables children to learn the skills necessary to move effectively and safely from place to place in school, home, at work and in the community.  Therefore, we do not believe that further clarification is necessary.  We also do not believe that it is necessary to add travel training to the definition of transition services, as recommended by the commenters.  We believe that IEP Teams already consider the importance of transportation and travel training services in the course of planning for a student's postsecondary transition needs.  It is unnecessary to state that travel training includes instructing children with disabilities other than blindness, as requested by the commenters, because the definition of travel training already states that travel training is appropriate for any child with a disability who requires this instruction.  </span></dd>

regulations before a parent revokes consent for the continued provision 
of special education and related services. However, for the same 
reasons that mediation is not allowed when a parent refuses to provide 
initial consent for services, mediation is not appropriate once a 
parent revokes consent for the provision of special education and 
related services.

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(iii)(II) of the Act, creates an exception to the parental consent requirements for initial evaluations for a child who is a ward of the State who is not residing with the child's parent if the public agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain the parent's consent, but is unable to discover the whereabouts of the parent, the rights of the parent of the child have been terminated under State law, or the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge under State law and consent for the initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.  New Sec. 300.300(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)) permits the public agency to proceed with the child's initial evaluation without first obtaining the requisite parental consent only in the circumstances detailed in Sec. 300.300(a)(2).  Therefore, when one or more of the circumstances in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) are met and a surrogate has not yet been appointed, the public agency need not postpone the child's evaluation to await the appointment of a surrogate.  This is appropriate because in situations involving requests for initial evaluations, in most cases a surrogate parent has not yet been appointed and delaying an initial evaluation until after a surrogate is appointed and has given consent may not be in the best interests of the child.  In contrast, in most situations involving consent for reevaluation, a surrogate parent should already have been appointed under Sec. 300.519 if no parent can be identified, the public agency has been unable to locate a parent, the child is a ward of the State or the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth.

Sec. 300.114 through 300.120, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, are clear that each public agency must ensure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who are nondisabled.  Section 300.117, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, is clear that this includes nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities. </span></dd>

The commenter stated that services such as athletics, recreational activities and clubs, counseling, transportation and health services should not be included in the regulations because they may be costly and are usually available on a limited basis.  One commenter stated that it is confusing to include related services in the examples of nonacademic services and recommended that they be removed.  </span></dd>

	The Department believes, however, that public agencies have an obligation to change a battery or routinely check an external component of a surgically implanted medical device to make sure it is turned on and operating.  However, mapping a cochlear implant (or paying the costs associated with mapping) is not routine checking as described above and should not be the responsibility of a public agency.  We will add language to the regulations to clarify a public agency's responsibility regarding the routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The exception referred to by the commenters is already in the regulations.  Section 300.301(d)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers to a new school before an evaluation is completed, if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  While the exception to the 60-day timeframe, as stated in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, only applies when a child transfers to a school located in another public agency, we do not believe the language in paragraph (d)(2), as proposed in the NPRM, is necessarily clear on this matter.  We, therefore, have added language in paragraph (d)(2) to provide additional clarity.  We believe it is important that it is understood that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency.  When a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency, we expect that an initial evaluation will be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the State-established timeframe.  </span></dd>

Section 300.504(a), which incorporates changes in section 615(d)(1) of the Act, requires that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents of children with disabilities only once a school year, except that a copy must also be given when an initial evaluation or parent request for an evaluation occurs; the first time a due process hearing is requested during a school year; when the decision to take disciplinary action is made; and when a parent requests the notice.  The prior law required that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to the parents upon initial referral for an evaluation, each notification of an IEP Team meeting, each reevaluation of the child, and the registration of each request for a due process hearing.  Under the final regulations, a copy of the procedural safeguards notice no longer has to be given to parents with each notice for an IEP Team meeting or every time a request for a due process hearing is received.  Instead, the document only has to be given to parents once a year, and the first time a due process hearing is requested in a year, when the decision to take disciplinary action is made, when a copy of the document is specifically requested by a parent, or when an initial evaluation or request for a reevaluation occurs.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.  We believe altering this timeframe would be unnecessarily disruptive to States' developed complaint procedures.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is appropriate to change the time limit as recommended by the commenters.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.  We will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a cochlear implant is an example of device optimization and is not a related service under the Act.</span></dd>

It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.  Section 300.503 already requires prior written notice to be given to the parents of a child with a disability a reasonable time before the public agency proposes (or refuses) to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.503(c) and 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and provided in the native language or other mode of communication of the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the public agency must take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We are maintaining the provisions in proposed Sec. 300.518(c), (new Sec. 300.518(d)), but with one modification.  The basis for this regulation is the longstanding judicial interpretation of the Act's pendency provision that when a hearing officer's decision is in agreement with the parent that a change in placement is appropriate, that decision constitutes an agreement by the State agency and the parent for purposes of determining the child's current placement during subsequent appeals.  See, e.g., Burlington School Committee v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Susquenita School District v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 84 (3rd Cir. 1996); Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Administrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635, 641 (9th Cir. 1990).  To clarify that new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) does not apply to a first-tier due process hearing decision in a State that has two tiers of administrative review, but only to a State-level hearing officer's decision in a one-tier system or State review official's decision in a two-tier system that is in favor of a parent's proposed placement, we are removing the reference to "local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d).  This change is made to align the regulation more closely with case law.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.531, consistent with section 615(k)(2) of the Act, provides that the IEP Team determines the interim alternative educational setting for removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Additionally, section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act is clear that, during an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act, the child must remain in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action expires, whichever comes first, unless the parent and the LEA agree otherwise.  Thus, under the Act, whenever a hearing is requested under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the LEA, it is the parties involved in the hearing (i.e., the parent and the LEA), not the IEP Team, that may agree to change the time period of the removal or the interim setting for the child.  We, therefore, do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenter.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations, however, which would prohibit the parents and the LEA from agreeing to involve the IEP Team in any decision to change the time period of the removal or interim alternative educational setting.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Published estimates of the cost of multidisciplinary evaluations range from $500 to $2,500, but these estimates may overestimate potential savings because testing is a significant factor in the cost of evaluations, and districts are already permitted to dispense with additional testing when extant data are sufficient for reevaluation.  The extent to which States and districts eliminated unnecessary testing during triennial evaluations under the previous regulations is unclear, but program officers estimate that additional testing or observation by a school psychologist is not needed for as many as half of the approximately 1.7 million children eligible for triennial evaluations each year.  In the estimated 850,000 cases in which additional testing is not needed, review of the extant data may still be warranted to determine if a child still needs special education and related services under the Act or to assess whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services being provided are needed to help the child meet the child's IEP goals.  Even if additions or modifications to special education and related services are not likely, parents may not want to dispense with the triennial evaluation if they believe further information could be gained from the extant data or they want to compare their child's progress against his or her previous assessments.  If parents and the district agree that a reevaluation is not needed in 15 percent, or 127,500, of these cases and a reevaluation using only extant data would have cost $150, the final regulations could save $19.125 million. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.  However, to provide additional clarity we will revise paragraph (c)(1) of this section to explicitly state that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</span></dd>

have included the provision in Sec.300.9 because the provision

addresses revocation of consent, explaining that consent is voluntary 
and may be revoked at any time. Further, Sec.300.9(c) states that the 
parent's revocation of consent is not retroactive in that revocation 
does not negate an action that has occurred after the consent was given 
and before the consent was revoked. Proposed Sec.  300.9(c)(3) further 
defines the effect of a parent's revocation of consent on the content 
of his or her child's education records. A parent's revocation of 
consent is not retroactive; consequently, the public agency would not 
be required to amend the child's education records to remove any 
references to the child's receipt of special education and related 
services in the event the child's parent revokes consent. Therefore, we 
decline to follow the commenters' recommendation to remove Sec.

Discussion:  Through its review of charter schools' access to Federal funding, it has come to the Department's attention that additional guidance is needed regarding whether charter schools that are established as their own LEAs must be nonprofit entities in order to meet the definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28.  The definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28(b)(2) specifically includes a public charter school that is established as an LEA under State law and that exercises administrative control or direction of, or performs a service function for, itself.  For purposes of the Act, the definitions of charter school, elementary school, and secondary school in Sec. Sec. 300.7, 300.13, and 300.36, respectively, require that a public elementary or secondary charter school be a nonprofit entity.  Therefore, a public elementary or secondary charter school established as its own LEA under State law, also must be a nonprofit entity.  Although these regulations do not specifically define nonprofit, the definition in 34 CFR Sec. 77.1 applies to these regulations.  In order to eliminate any confusion on this issue, we will revise the definition of LEA to reflect that a public elementary or secondary charter school that is established as its own LEA under State law must be a nonprofit entity.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 incorporates the definition in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.

The definition in the Act specifically refers to any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of the child and specifically excludes a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Accordingly, we continue to believe it is appropriate to exclude surgically implanted medical devices from this definition.  In response to the second comment, Sec. 300.105(a) requires each public agency to ensure that assistive technology devices (or assistive technology services, or both) are made available to a child with a disability if required as part of the child's special education, related services, or supplementary aids and services.

It is, however, important to ensure that parents have the information they need to participate meaningfully in IEP Team meetings, which may include reviewing their child's records.  Section 300.613(a) requires a public agency to comply with a parent request to inspect and review existing education records, including an evaluation report, without unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IEP, and in no case more than 45 days after the request has been made.  This includes the right to a response from the public agency to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of records, consistent with Sec. 300.613(b)(1).</span></dd>

Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) clarifies that parents have the 
right to withdraw their child from special education and related 
services. After revoking consent for his or her child, a parent always 
maintains the right to subsequently request an initial evaluation to 
determine if the child is a child with a disability who needs special 
education and related services. Nothing in the Act or the implementing 
regulations prevents a parent from requesting an evaluation when their 
child has a discipline issue or is at risk of not succeeding in school. 
This is because, consistent with Sec.  300.101, the public agency has 
an affirmative obligation to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. The child's right to have FAPE available does not cease to 
exist upon the revocation of consent. Therefore, a parent may consider 
discipline and graduation requirements when determining whether to 
request special education and related services for their child.

Discussion:  Section 614 (a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an SEA, other State agency, or LEA shall conduct a full and individual evaluation of a child before the provision of special education and related services.  In Sec. 300.301(a), we interpret this language as requiring public agencies, as that term is defined in Sec. 300.33, to conduct evaluations, because those are the only agencies in the State responsible for providing FAPE to eligible children.  The same language is used in section 614(a)(1)(B) of the Act to describe the agencies that may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if a child is a child with a disability.  We similarly interpret this language to be referring to the entities that are public agencies under Sec. 300.33.  Therefore, Sec. 300.301(b) states that either a parent or a public agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation.  The language does not include employees of SEAs or LEAs (e.g., teachers and related services providers), unless they are acting for the SEA or LEA, or of other State agencies (e.g., probation officers, social workers, or staff from State agencies that are not public agencies as defined in Sec. 300.33).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that "and" should be used instead of "or" between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii), because this would subject the child to two different identification models.  We agree that failing a State assessment alone is not sufficient to determine whether a child has an SLD.  However, failing a State assessment may be one factor in an evaluation considered by the eligibility group.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the evaluation must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant information about the child.  Further, Sec. 300.304(b)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act, is clear that determining eligibility for special education and related services cannot be based on any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The first element in identifying a child with SLD should be a child's mastery of grade-level content appropriate for the child's age or in relation to State-approved grade-level standards, not abilities.  This emphasis is consistent with the focus in the ESEA on the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards for all children.  State-approved standards are not expressed as "norms" but represent benchmarks for all children at each grade level.  The performance of classmates and peers is not an appropriate standard if most children in a class or school are not meeting State-approved standards.  Furthermore, using grade-based normative data to make this determination is generally not appropriate for children who have not been permitted to progress to the next academic grade or are otherwise older than their peers.  Such a practice may give the illusion of average rates of learning when the child's rate of learning has been below average, resulting in retention.  A focus on expectations relative to abilities or classmates simply dilutes expectations for children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

We will modify Sec. 300.309(a)(1) to clarify that, as a first element in determining whether a child has an SLD, the group must determine that the child does not demonstrate achievement that is adequate for the child's age or the attainment of State-approved grade-level standards, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas listed in Sec. 300.309(a)(1).

The reference to "instruction" will be added to emphasize that children may not be identified as having SLD if there is no documentation of appropriate instruction, consistent with the Act and the ESEA.

Discussion:  The Act requires that LEAs be permitted to use a process that determines if a child responds to research-based interventions.  Further, there is an evidence base to support the use of RTI models to identify children with SLD on a wide scale, including young children and children from minority backgrounds.  These include several large-scale implementations in Iowa (the Heartland model; Tilly, 2002); the Minneapolis public schools (Marston, 2003); applications of the Screening to Enhance Equitable Placement (STEEP) model in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arizona (VanDerHeyden, Witt, and Gilbertson, in press); and other examples (NASDE, 2005).1  While it is true that much of the research on RTI models has been conducted in the area of reading, 80 to 90 percent of children with SLD experience reading problems.  The implementation of RTI in practice, however, has included other domains.  RTI is only one component of the process to identify children in need of special education and related services.  Determining why a child has not responded to research-based interventions requires a comprehensive evaluation. </span></dd>

Comment:  Numerous commenters supported the requirement in Sec. 300.309(b)(1) for data demonstrating that a child suspected of having an SLD has been provided with high-quality, research-based instruction in regular education settings delivered by qualified personnel.  Several commenters stated that this requirement should apply to all children and asked why this requirement is confined to only children suspected of having SLD.  One commenter stated that if schools would use proven best practices, there would be fewer children in need of special education in the later grades.  However, one commenter stated that it is incorrect to assume that any child who is not responding to interventions must have an SLD when there are a myriad of reasons why children may not be responding to instruction.

	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.  In addition, children who do not receive appropriate educational services may develop behavioral problems that have a negative impact on the learning environment for other children.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Override of parental refusal to consent to a reevaluation is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.300(c) states that each public agency must obtain informed parental consent in accordance with Sec. 300.300(a)(1) prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability.  Section 300.300(a)(3) allows a public agency to override parental refusal to consent to an initial evaluation by utilizing the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516.  The cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(i) to the provision in Sec. 300.300(a)(1) provides the basis for allowing a public agency to override the parent's refusal of consent to a reevaluation.  However, we believe it is important to state this more directly and will, therefore, add language to Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to a reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part.</span></dd>

the Act and also depends on State law. That said, under Sec.  
300.321(a)(6), the IEP Team may include, at the discretion of the 
parent or public agency, individuals who have knowledge or special 
expertise regarding the child, including non-attorney advocates. While 
these individuals are members of the IEP Team, their role is not to 
``represent'' or speak for the parents.

Discussion:  Section 300.520(b) recognizes that some States have mechanisms to determine that a child with a disability who has reached the age of majority under State law does not have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program, even though the child has not been determined incompetent under State law.  In such States, the State must establish procedures for appointing the parent (or, if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual) to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the remainder of the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Whether parents may retain the ability to make educational decisions for a child who has reached the age of majority and who can provide informed consent is a matter of State laws regarding competency.  That is, the child may be able to grant the parent a power of attorney or similar grant of authority to act on the child's behalf under applicable State law.

In general, though, because removals under Sec. Sec. 300.530(g) and 300.532 will be for periods of time up to 45 days, care must be taken to ensure that if home instruction is provided for a child removed under Sec. 300.530, the services that are provided will satisfy the requirements for services for a removal under Sec. 300.530(d) and section 615(k)(1)(D) of the Act.  We do not believe, however, that it is appropriate to include in the regulations that a child's home is not a suitable placement setting for an interim alternative educational setting as suggested by the commenter.

The Act does not require children to be identified with a particular disability category for purposes of the delivery of special education and related services.

that has received notice, under section 616(d)(2) of the Act, of a 
pending enforcement action against the State under section 616(e) of 
the Act to provide public notice of the pendency of that action. 
Pursuant to section 616(d)(2)(B) of the Act, a State that has been 
determined to ``need intervention'' for three consecutive years or 
``need substantial intervention'' in implementing the requirements of 
Part B of the Act, faces enforcement actions and is entitled to 
reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing on such a 
determination. If a State requests a hearing on a determination, the 
Department's final determination would not be made until after that 
hearing. In this situation, the enforcement action also would depend on 
the outcome of the hearing and final determination. Therefore, in a 
case such as this, the public must be notified that the Secretary is 
proposing to take, but has not yet taken, an enforcement action

Discussion:  We believe a one-year timeline is reasonable, and will assist in smooth implementation of the State complaint procedures.  The references to longer periods for continuing violations and for compensatory services claims in current Sec. 300.662(c) were removed to ensure expedited resolution for public agencies and children with disabilities.  Limiting a complaint to a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date that the complaint is received will help ensure that problems are raised and addressed promptly so that children receive FAPE.  We believe longer time limits are not generally effective and beneficial to the child because the issues in a State complaint become so stale that they are unlikely to be resolved.  However, States may choose to accept and resolve complaints regarding alleged violations that occurred outside the one-year timeline, just as they are free to add additional protections in other areas that are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is necessary to retain the language in current Sec. 300.662(c).</span></dd>

Discussion:  The purpose of requiring the party filing the complaint to forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency serving the child, at the same time the party files the complaint with the SEA, is to ensure that the public agency involved has knowledge of the issues and an opportunity to resolve them directly with the complaining party at the earliest possible time.  The sooner the LEA knows that a complaint is filed and the nature of the issue(s), the quicker the LEA can work directly with the complainant to resolve the complaint.  We believe the benefit of having the complainant forward a copy of the complaint to the LEA or public agency far outweigh the minimal burden placed on the complainant because it will lead to a faster resolution of the complaint at the local level.

Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </span></dd>

educational services to a child. This notice would normally be given 
after a child graduates or otherwise leaves the agency. In instances 
when an agency intends to destroy personally identifiable information 
that is no longer needed to provide educational services to a child and 
informs the parents of that determination, the parents may want to 
exercise their right, under Sec.  300.613, to access those records and 
request copies of the records they may need to acquire post-school 
benefits.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of educational service agency is based on the provisions in section 602(5) of the Act.  The definition was added by the Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-17, to replace the definition of "intermediate educational unit" (IEU) in section 602(23) of the Act, as in effect prior to June 4, 1997.  Educational service agency does not exclude entities that were considered IEUs under prior law.  To avoid any confusion about the use of this term, the definition clarifies that educational service agency includes entities that meet the definition of IEU in section 602(23) of the Act as in effect prior to June 4, 1997.  We believe the citation for IEU is consistent with the Act. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The list of acute or chronic health conditions in the definition of other health impairment is not exhaustive, but rather provides examples of problems that children have that could make them eligible for special education and related services under the category of other health impairment.  We decline to include dysphagia, FAS, bipolar disorders, and other organic neurological disorders in the definition of other health impairment because these conditions are commonly understood to be health impairments.  However, we do believe that Tourette syndrome is commonly misunderstood to be a behavioral or emotional condition, rather than a neurological condition.  Therefore, including Tourette syndrome in the definition of other health impairment may help correct the misperception of Tourette syndrome as a behavioral or conduct disorder and prevent the misdiagnosis of their needs.  </span></dd>

We inadvertently omitted the provisions in section 604 of the Act, regarding States' sovereign immunity.  We have added these to the regulations in new Sec. 300.177.  In paragraph (a), we have clarified that the statutory language means that a State must waive immunity in order to receive Part B funds.  This is the longstanding interpretation of the Department and is consistent with Federal Circuit Courts' decisions interpreting this statutory language.  (See, e.g., Pace v. Bogalusa City Sch. Bd., 403 F.3d 272 (5th Cir. 2005); M.A. ex rel. E.S. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist., 344 F.3d 335 (3rd Cir. 2003); Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Mauney, 183 F.3d 816 (8th Cir. 1999); Marie O. v.

It is noteworthy that the provision in new Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(ii)(C)) is only a limited exception to the requirement to obtain informed parental consent for an initial evaluation.  Most children will not have a surrogate parent already appointed at this stage of their involvement with services under the Act.  However, if a child has a surrogate parent appointed under Sec. 300.519(c), and the rights of that person to make educational decisions for the child have not been subrogated by a judge under State law, the public agency would have to seek informed parental consent from that person.  </span></dd>

A few commenters stated that Sec. 300.300(a)(3) is inconsistent with statutory language and opposed language stating that the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of a child whose parents have refused to consent or failed to respond to a request for consent.</span></dd>

Consistent with the Department's position that public agencies should use their consent override procedures only in rare circumstances, Sec. 300.300(a)(3) clarifies that a public agency is not required to pursue an initial evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability if the parent does not provide consent for the initial evaluation.

Discussion:  Section 300.320(a)(4) incorporates the language in section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act, which requires that special education and related services and supplementary aids and services be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.  The Act does not refer to "evidenced-based practices" or "emerging best practices," which are generally terms of art that may or may not be based on peer-reviewed research.  Therefore, we decline to change Sec. 300.320(a)(4) in the manner suggested by the commenters.  The phrase "to the extent practicable," as used this context, generally means that services and supports should be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent that it is possible, given the availability of peer-reviewed research.

Comment:  Many commenters disagreed with changing the age at which transition services must be provided to a child with a disability from 14 years to 16 years.  One commenter recommended that transition services begin at age 13.  Another commenter recommended that transition services begin before high school, because if there is a choice of high schools, transition goals may be a determining factor in the selection process.  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that States may continue to begin transition services with the first IEP after the child turns age 14.

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern that the right of parents of children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools to file a due process complaint against an LEA is limited to filing a due process complaint that an LEA has failed to comply with the child find and evaluation requirements, and not an LEA's failure to provide special education and related services as required in the services plan.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations clarify whether the parent should file a due process complaint with the LEA of residence or with the LEA where the private school is located. </span></dd>

We do not believe it is necessary to clarify in the regulations that the State complaint procedures can be used to resolve a complaint regarding the denial of appropriate services or FAPE for a child, since Sec. 300.153 is sufficiently clear that an organization or individual may file a written complaint that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300.

We do not believe the removal of current Sec. 300.653 will mean that the States will not ensure that State advisory panel meetings are announced in advance and open to the public because States generally have adequate sunshine laws that ensure public access to governmental agency meetings.  We do not believe it is necessary to require that information regarding State advisory panel meetings be posted on State Web sites because sunshine laws generally contain provisions regarding meeting notices, agendas, and the availability of minutes of public meetings.  However, it is important that individuals consult the laws governing their State and locality on the issue of open meetings and public access.  </span></dd>

The process for determining the educational placement for children with low-incidence disabilities (including children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind) is the same process used for determining the educational placement for all children with disabilities.  That is, each child's educational placement must be determined on an individual case-by-case basis depending on each child's unique educational needs and circumstances, rather than by the child's category of disability, and must be based on the child's IEP.

The Department believes that, given the increase in the number of children with disabilities with surgically implanted devices (e.g., cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulators, electronic muscle stimulators), and rapid advances in new technologies to help children with disabilities, it is important that these regulations clearly address any obligation public agencies have to provide follow-up and services to ensure that such devices are functioning properly.  </span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a 
child in a private school when FAPE is at issue does not constitute a 
revocation of consent under Sec.  300.300(b). However, the provisions 
concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by 
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.  
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when 
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a 
disagreement between the parent and public agency about the provision 
of FAPE, do not constitute parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services.

We also disagree that allowing a parent to revoke consent for the 
provision of special education and related services under Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) procedurally or substantively lessens protections 
provided to children with disabilities as embodied in regulations in 
effect on July 20, 1983. As previously stated in response to other 
comments, a parent is recognized under the Act as the party responsible 
for protecting the child's interest in obtaining appropriate 
educational services. It is the Department's position that the 
protections provided to children with disabilities are enlarged rather 
than lessened by amending the regulations to provide that a parent's 
decision to revoke consent for the continued provision of special 
education and related services cannot be challenged by the public 
agency. Furthermore, the change reflected in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) is 
consistent with the legislative changes made to the Act in 2004, which 
included adding to section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act the 
requirement that parental consent be obtained before the public agency 
begins to provide special education and related services to their 
child. In our view, the better reading of the Act, especially in light 
of the Department's long-standing regulatory definition of ``consent,'' 
which has included the concept that consent can be revoked at any time, 
is that a parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of 
services cannot be challenged by a public agency any more than a 
parent's refusal to provide consent for the initial provision of 
special education and related services can be.

Discussion:  Congress recognized the unique problems homeless children face and included several new provisions in the Act to ensure that homeless children and youth with disabilities have access to the same services and supports as all other children with disabilities.  The Department recognizes that the high mobility rates of some homeless children with disabilities (as well as other children, including some children who are in the custody of a State child welfare agency) pose unique challenges when a child is referred for an evaluation, but moves to another district or State before an evaluation can be initiated or completed.  In such cases, the Department believes it is important that the evaluations be completed as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the date on which the child was first referred for evaluation in any LEA.  However, the high mobility rate of these children and their potential range of evaluation needs means that any specific expedited timeframe could be both too long to ensure that all children are evaluated before they move, and too short to be reasonable in all circumstances.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from establishing its own policies to address the needs of homeless children, including adopting a timeframe for initial evaluations that is less than 60 days.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: Certain provisions in the Part 300 regulations, such as 
the definition of parent in Sec.  300.30 and the requirements regarding 
surrogate parents in Sec.  300.519, ensure that a child with a 
disability has an individual who can act as a parent to make 
educational decisions on behalf of the child. Parent, as defined in 
Sec.  300.30, means a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a 
foster parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual 
obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from 
acting as a parent; a guardian generally authorized to act as the 
child's parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the 
child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); an 
individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent 
(including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the 
child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child's welfare. The definition of parent also 
includes a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with 
Sec.  300.519 and section 639(a)(5) of the Act. The duty to appoint a 
surrogate parent under Sec.  300.519 arises when no parent can be 
identified, the public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate 
a parent, the child is a ward of the State, or the child is an 
unaccompanied homeless youth, as defined in section 725(6) of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434(a)(6)).

Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  It is important for public agencies to include an explanation of the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and the due process complaint procedures in Sec. 300.507 in the procedural safeguards notice to assist parents in understanding the differences between these procedures.  The reference to "jurisdictional issues" addresses the scope of the State complaint and due process complaint procedures.  An organization or individual may file a State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 alleging that a public agency has violated a requirement of the Act for a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date on which the complaint is received, unless one of the exceptions in Sec. 300.153(c) is applicable.  The Department's longstanding position is that a State must resolve any complaint, and may not remove from the jurisdiction of its State complaint procedures complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child simply because those issues also could be the subject of a due process complaint.  We view the State complaint procedures as a very important tool in a State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities, consistent with sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a) of the Act, to monitor LEA implementation of the requirements in Part B of the Act.  These responsibilities extend to both systemic and child-specific issues.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The requirements in section 616(a)(1) of the Act, relating to a State's monitoring responsibilities, are included in the regulations in Sec. 300.600(a).  Further, as indicated in the response to the previous comment, a provision regarding the State's responsibility to monitor LEAs located in the State using the indicators in the monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act has been added in new Sec. 300.600(d).  Regarding the Secretary's monitoring responsibility, section 616(a)(1) of the Act is clear that the Secretary must monitor implementation of Part B of the Act through the oversight of States' exercise of general supervision and through the State performance plans.  Sections 616(a)(3) and 616(b) further describe the Secretary's responsibilities to monitor States' implementation of Part B of the Act.  In addition, note 253-258 of the Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 232, provides that the Secretary must request such information from States and stakeholders as is necessary to implement the purposes of the Act, including the use of on-site monitoring visits and file reviews to enforce the requirements of the Act.  We continue to believe it is unnecessary to include the Secretary's obligations in the regulations.

Discussion:  The hearing referenced in Sec. 300.532(a) and (c) is the same hearing and not separate hearings.  Paragraph (a) in this section states that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding a placement, or the manifestation determination, or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request a hearing.  Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  We believe these regulations will ensure that the basic protections regarding hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States to adjust other procedural rules they may have superimposed on due process hearings in light of the expedited nature of these hearings.  Further, we believe it is important that all the due process protections in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are maintained because of the importance of the rights at issue in these hearings.</span></dd>

Discussion: We agree that it is important for parents to be informed that their child will be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards.

As the commenters point out, this information is particularly important in a State where students must pass a particular assessment to be eligible to receive a regular high school diploma. Therefore, we have added a regulation requiring a State to provide IEP Teams, which include the parent, with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify a student for a regular high school diploma). We also have required a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based those standards.

Discussion:  Section 300.131(c), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(III) of the Act, requires that, in carrying out child find for parentally-placed private school children, SEAs and LEAs must undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for their publicly enrolled or publicly-placed children.  This would generally include, but is not limited to, such activities as widely distributing informational brochures, providing regular public service announcements, staffing exhibits at health fairs and other community activities, and creating direct liaisons with private schools.  Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.  In addition, evaluations of all children suspected of having disabilities under Part B of the Act, regardless of whether they are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools, must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311, consistent with section 614(a) through (c) of the Act, which describes the procedures for evaluations and reevaluations for all children with disabilities.  We believe the phrase "activities similar" is understood by SEAs and LEAs and, therefore, it is not necessary to regulate on the meaning of the phrase.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.  However, the parties may agree to waive the resolution meeting or agree to use the mediation process.</span></dd>

We do not agree that allowing middle and high school students with the most significant cognitive disabilities to be taught by teachers who meet the qualifications of a highly qualified elementary teacher fosters low expectations, encourages students to be treated like children, promotes instruction that is not age appropriate, or denies students access to the general curriculum.  Although alternate achievement standards differ in complexity from grade-level standards, 34 CFR 200.1(d) requires that alternate achievement standards be aligned with the State's content standards, promote access to the general curriculum, and reflect professional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible.  In short, we believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.18(c) will ensure that teachers teaching exclusively children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards will have the knowledge to provide instruction aligned to grade-level content standards so that students with the most significant cognitive disabilities are taught a curriculum that is closely tied to the general curriculum.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device does not list specific devices, nor would it be practical or possible to include an exhaustive list of assistive technology devices.  Whether an augmentative communication device, playback devices, or other devices could be considered an assistive technology device for a child depends on whether the device is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability, and whether the child's individualized education program (IEP) Team determines that the child needs the device in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).  However, medical devices that are surgically implanted, including those used for breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions, are excluded from the definition of an assistive technology device in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.

Parents of children with cochlear implants and parents of children with hearing aids both frequently bring to school extra batteries, cords, and other parts for the hearing aids and externally worn speech processors connected with the surgically-implanted devices, especially for younger children.

"Technically sound instruments" generally refers to assessments that have been shown through research to be valid and reliable.  Therefore, it would be redundant to add language requiring that instruments used in reevaluations be based on scientific research methods, as recommended by one commenter.  The phrase "relative contribution," as used in Sec. 300.304(b)(3), generally means that assessment instruments that allow the examiner to determine the extent to which a child's behavior is a result of cognitive, behavioral, physical, or developmental factors may be used in evaluating a child in accordance with Sec. 300.304.  Because the meaning of "relative contribution" is context specific, we do not believe it should be defined in these regulations.  </span></dd>

Comment:  We received a number of comments concerning the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction provided by qualified personnel.  One commenter stated that it would be difficult for rural school districts to meet this requirement because of staffing requirements in the regular education setting.  Several commenters stated that the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority and should be removed, because it provides a basis for challenging any determination under the category of SLD.  One commenter asked for clarification regarding the legal basis for providing high-quality, research-based instruction if the child is not determined eligible for special education.  Another commenter stated that attorneys will read Sec. 300.309(b) as providing a legal entitlement to ESEA, research-based instruction and data-based documentation for every child considered for eligibility under the category of SLD, and that when this standard is not met, will bring the matter to a due process hearing and request compensatory education. </span></dd>

Discussion:  As part of the evaluation, the eligibility group must consider whether the child received appropriate instruction from qualified personnel.  For children who attend private schools or charter schools or who are home-schooled, it may be necessary to obtain information from parents and teachers about the curricula used and the child's progress with various teaching strategies.  The eligibility group also may need to use information from current classroom-based assessments or classroom observations.  On the basis of the available information, the eligibility group may identify other information that is needed to determine whether the child's low achievement is due to a disability, and not primarily the result of lack of appropriate instruction.  The requirements for special education eligibility or the expectations for the quality of teachers or instructional programs are not affected, and do not differ, by the location or venue of a child's instruction. </span></dd>

A few commenters recommended that children who are not progressing because they have not received research-based instruction by a qualified teacher should immediately receive intensive, high-quality, research-based instruction by qualified personnel.  One commenter expressed concern that Sec. 300.309(b) restricts referrals to only those children who have received high-quality, research-based instruction from qualified teachers.  One commenter stated that a child's eligibility to receive special education services under the category of SLD appears to be contingent on the LEA's commitment to providing effective regular education services by qualified staff, and, as such, a child with an SLD is held hostage by a system that is not working.  One commenter asked whether the eligibility group can make a determination that a child has an SLD in the absence of a child's response to high-quality research-based instruction.  </span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters recommended clarifying when parental consent for evaluation should be obtained and when the 60-day timeline to complete an evaluation begins.  Several commenters recommended ensuring that the 60-day timeline for evaluation applies regardless of the evaluation model used.  One commenter asked how scientific research-based interventions could be completed within a 60-day evaluation timeline.  One commenter stated that 60 days may not be enough time to appropriately determine whether a child responds to instruction, particularly for children who have not had exposure to such interventions (e.g., children entering the public school system for the first time).  One commenter asked if the intent of the regulations is to allow a determination that a child has an SLD to take place outside the timeline for an initial evaluation, and stated that without clarification of the intersection between an RTI process (that may, by definition, require additional time beyond that which is permitted for an evaluation) and the required period of time for an initial assessment, the regulations would cause confusion and result in improper evaluations and eligibility determinations.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The language requested by the commenter is not necessary because section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act already provides for situations in which a parent refuses consent for initial services and the child subsequently engages in behavior that violates a code of student conduct.  Section 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, or has refused services under this part.  Therefore, such a child would not be able to assert any of the protections provided to children with disabilities under the Act, and would be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as any other child.  </span></dd>

Concerning the comments about a student who reaches the age of 
majority holding a school responsible for loss of Part B services, 
Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(iii) provides that, if the parent of a child 
revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special 
education and related services, the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child because of the failure to provide the child with further 
special education and related services. Therefore, granting the public 
agency immunity is not necessary because the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child if the parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services. Revocation of parental consent releases the LEA from 
liability for providing FAPE from the time the parent revokes consent 
for special education and related services until the time, if any, that 
the child is evaluated and deemed eligible, once again, for special

Concerning the comment that revoking consent should be treated 
differently than refusing to provide initial consent because the parent 
is seeking to terminate special education services that are presently

placement is in a residential setting, we appreciate that there are 
differences between consent for special education and related services 
and revocation of such consent. However, at their core, both issues 
entail a parent's decision of whether a child will receive special 
education and related services. Thus, section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and

the positive efforts taken by States will vary based on the unique and

change over time. For example, a public agency's positive efforts might 
include participating in an employment fair that is targeted at 
individuals with disabilities, sending vacancy announcements to 
organizations for individuals with disabilities and ensuring that 
employees with disabilities are aware of promotion opportunities. As a 
separate obligation under Section 504, each recipient of assistance

Discussion:  Section 300.190 retains the authority for a by-pass in current Sec. 300.480 and includes additional authority for a by-pass, consistent with section 612(f)(1) of the Act, in cases where the Secretary determines that an SEA, LEA, or public agency has substantially failed, or is unwilling, to provide for equitable participation of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  When the Secretary authorizes a by-pass it is important that all parties understand the process by which the Secretary determines the funds that will be deducted from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act to provide services, as well as the actions that are required before the Secretary takes any final action to implement a by-pass.  When such processes and procedures are clearly described, time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions.  The requirements in Sec.

As a matter of practice, public agencies use a variety of methods to contact parents depending on the ways they find to be most efficient and effective for a particular situation.

Discussion:  The commenter confuses the Act's prior written notice requirements with the requirements governing IEP Team meetings.  Section 300.503(a), consistent with section 615(b)(3) of the Act, requires prior written notice whenever a public agency proposes to initiate or change (or refuses to initiate or change) the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision of FAPE to a child.  A public agency meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503 so long as the prior written notice is provided a reasonable time before the public agency implements the proposal (or refusal) described in the notice.  A public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting before it proposes a change in the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  The proposal, however, triggers the obligation to convene an IEP Team meeting.  Providing prior written notice in advance of meetings could suggest, in some circumstances, that the public agency's proposal was improperly arrived at before the meeting and without parent input.

Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.  The Department believes it is important for a child with a disability to participate in determining the child's postsecondary goals and for the IEP Team to consider the child's preferences and interests in determining those goals.</span></dd>

Likewise, there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the failure of a public agency to provide services based on peer-reviewed research would automatically result in a denial of FAPE.

Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) in current Sec. 300.350, regarding accountability for a child achieving his or her goals, are unnecessary because other Federal laws, such as title I of the ESEA, already provide sufficient motivation for agency effort to assist children with disabilities in making academic progress.  Current Sec. 300.350(c), regarding the rights of parents to invoke due process procedures if a parent feels that efforts are not being made to achieve the IEP goals, is unnecessary because it merely provides explanatory information regarding the due process procedures for parents and children that are available in Sec.

Discussion:  It is not necessary to amend the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenters.  To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected, Sec. 300.519(b) requires public agencies to have a method for determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent and for assigning a surrogate parent to a child.  Such methods would include determining whether a court has already appointed a surrogate parent, as provided under Sec. 300.519(c).  Therefore, it is unnecessary to add language requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one, as requested by a commenter.  Section 300.519(d)(1) allows a public agency to select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law, and Sec. 300.519(h) requires the SEA to make reasonable efforts to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.  </span></dd>

As stated above, we read the Act as modifying the concept of FAPE in circumstances where a child is removed from his or her current placement for disciplinary reasons.  Specifically, we interpret section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to require that the special education and related services that are necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP, must be provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and, to the extent appropriate to the circumstances, be provided in conformity with the child's IEP.  We, therefore, believe Sec. 300.530(d)(1) should be amended to be consistent with the Act by adding the reference to the FAPE requirements in Sec. 300.101(a), and to ensure it is understood that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons are consistent with the FAPE requirements in section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  </span></dd>

In light of the short-term nature of the removals under paragraph (d)(4) of the section and the need for school personnel to make quick decisions regarding services, we believe local school personnel need broad flexibility in making such decisions and are in the best position to determine the appropriate teacher with whom to consult.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), which allows a State to shorten the time periods for the disclosure of evidence, evaluations, and recommendations for expedited due process hearings to two business days, because it will not give a parent adequate time to prepare for hearings, especially when a parent doesn't have a lawyer.  One commenter stated that because LEAs have possession and control of education records, a reduction to two days for disclosure is unfair and creates a hardship on a parent in preparing for the hearing.  Other commenters stated that this provision is inconsistent with section 615(f)(2) of the Act, which requires that not less than five business days prior to a hearing, parties must disclose all evaluations and recommendations that parties intend to use at a hearing.  A few commenters stated that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4) diminishes the protections for children with disabilities and their parents found in the July 20, 1983 regulations, and, therefore, violates section 607(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe that Sec. 300.535(b)(2) goes beyond the scope of the Act as sections 612(a)(8) and 617(c) of the Act direct the Secretary to take appropriate action, in accordance with FERPA, to assure the confidentiality of personally identifiable information contained in records collected or maintained by the Secretary and by SEAs and LEAs.  We therefore are not removing this provision.  We maintain that the provisions in section 615(k)(6)(B) of the Act, as reflected in Sec. 300.535(b)(2), must be read consistent with the disclosures permitted under FERPA for the education records of all children.  Under FERPA, personally identifiable information (such as the child's status as a special education child) can only be released with parental consent, except in certain very limited circumstances.

Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe that it is not necessary to modify the regulations to include a requirement that a manifestation determination include a case-by-case analysis of the disability of the child because section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(e) are sufficiently clear that decisions regarding the manifestation determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.  We believe the Act recognizes that a child with a disability may display disruptive behaviors characteristic of the child's disability and the child should not be punished for behaviors that are a result of the child's disability.  The intent of Congress in developing section 615(k)(1)(E) was that, in determining that a child's conduct was a manifestation of his or her disability, it must be determined that "the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, and was not an attenuated association, such as low self-esteem, to the child's disability."

Discussion:  Section 300.600(a), consistent with section 616(a)(1)(C) of the Act, requires States to monitor implementation and enforcement of the Act.  As discussed elsewhere in this section in response to comments regarding Sec. 300.604 (Enforcement), we have revised Sec. 300.600(a) to identify the specific enforcement actions included in Sec. 300.604 that are appropriate for States to use with LEAs.  The new Sec. 300.600(a) identifies specific methods that must be used to ensure correction when an LEA has been determined to need assistance for two consecutive years or to need intervention for three or more consecutive years.  For example, Sec. 300.600(a) refers to Sec. 300.604(b)(2)(i), which discusses the preparation of a corrective action or improvement plan.  In addition, new Sec. 300.608(b) clarifies that States can use other authority available to them to monitor and enforce the Act.

Requiring that corrective action plans be developed in every instance is overly prescriptive when there are multiple methods that can be used.  Accordingly, we do not think it is necessary to make the change suggested by the commenter.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
	With respect to the definition of significant disproportionality, each State has the discretion to define the term for the LEAs and for the State in general.  Therefore, in identifying significant disproportionality, a State may determine statistically significant levels.  The State's review of its constituent LEAs' policies, practices, and procedures for identifying and placing children with disabilities would occur in LEAs with significant disproportionality in identification, placement, or discipline, based on the examination of the data.  The purpose of this review is to determine if the policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with the Act.  Establishing a national standard for significant disproportionality is not appropriate because there are multiple factors at the State level to consider in making such determinations.  For example, States need to consider the population size, the size of individual LEAs, and composition of State population.  States are in the best position to evaluate those factors.  The Department has provided guidance to States on methods for assessing disproportionality.  This guidance can be found at:  http://www.ideadata.org/docs/Disproportionality%20Technical%20Assistance%20Guide.pdf.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Sections 300.530(g) through 300.532 incorporate two significant statutory changes relating to the authority of school personnel to remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings.  First, the Act now gives school personnel the authority to remove to interim alternative educational settings children who have inflicted serious bodily injury to themselves, or others.  Under previous law, school personnel were authorized to remove children to alternative settings only for misconduct involving: 1) the use and possession of weapons; and 2) the knowing possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The Act added the commission of serious bodily injury to this list.  In cases involving serious bodily injury, school personnel would be able to unilaterally remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings for up to 45 school days without having to request that a hearing officer review the facts to determine whether or not the child is substantially likely to harm him or herself or others.  Second, the 45-day rule has changed.  Under previous law, students could not be removed to interim alternative educational settings for more than 45 days.  Now, under the Act, the comparable time limitation is 45 school days.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
While school personnel are not required to use the new authority to remove children who have inflicted serious bodily injury or to remove children for the total amount of time that is authorized, we acknowledge that it would create additional costs for schools that choose to take full advantage of this authority because of the added costs of providing services in interim alternative educational settings.  Using data from a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we estimate that approximately 3,007 children will be removed to an interim alternative educational setting in 2006-2007 for misconduct involving drugs or weapons and at least another 1,283 for misconduct involving serious bodily injury.  Although we do not have data on the costs of educating these children in an alternative setting for 45 school days, the Secretary concludes that the costs of doing so will be outweighed by the qualitative benefits to schools associated with ensuring children a safe and orderly environment that is conducive to learning.</span></dd>

Section 300.321(e)(2) permits certain members of an IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting that involves a modification to or discussion of the member's area of the curriculum or related service if the parent and the public agency consent in writing to the excusal and the member submits written input to the parent and the other members of the IEP Team prior to the meeting.  The change is unlikely to generate notable savings because reduced time spent in meetings is likely to be offset by the time required to draft written input, send it to the parents and other IEP Team members, and secure the consent of parents and public agency to the excusal.  In cases in which IEP Team meetings take longer than the average time of 1.5 hours, there are likely to be controversial issues or significant modifications to the IEP under discussion.  Parents are presumably less likely to consent to the excusal of team members in these instances.</span></dd>

The State complaint process is intended to be less adversarial than the more formal filing of a due process complaint and possibly going to a due process hearing.

Discussion:  Services offered to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may be provided on-site at a child's private school, including a religious school, to the extent consistent with law, or at another location.  The Department believes, in the interests of the child, LEAs should provide services on site at the child's private school so as not to unduly disrupt the child's educational experience, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  The phrase "to the extent consistent with law" is in section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act.  We interpret this language to mean that the provision of services on the premises of a private school takes place in a manner that would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would not be inconsistent with applicable State constitutions or law.  We, therefore, do not have the statutory authority to require that services be provided on-site.</span></dd>

Failure to provide transportation could effectively deny the child an opportunity to benefit from the services that the LEA has determined through consultation to offer its parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In this situation, although transportation is not a related service, as defined in Sec. 300.34, transportation is necessary to enable the child to participate and to make the offered services accessible to the child.  LEAs should work in consultation with representatives of private school children to ensure that services are provided at sites, including on the premises of the child's private school, so that LEAs do not incur significant transportation costs.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(e)(4) clarifies that parents who enroll their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools have the option of not participating in an LEA's child find activities required under Sec. 300.131.  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart D, once parents opt out of the public schools, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children as they do for children enrolled in public schools, in light of the public agencies' obligation to educate public school children with disabilities.  We further indicate in the discussion of subpart D that we have added new Sec. 300.300(e)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.300(d)) to clarify that if the parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the child's parent at the parent's own expense does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or reevaluation, the public agency may not use the due process procedures in section 615 of the Act and the public agency is not required to consider the child for equitable services.  </span></dd>

The obligation to conduct child find for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, is independent of the services provision.  Further, Sec. 300.131(d), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IV) of the Act, clarifies that the costs of child find activities for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether the LEA has spent an appropriate amount on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

Under Sec. 300.138(b), each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated by the LEA in which the private school is located to receive special education or related services must have a services plan.  The services plan must describe the specific special education and related services offered to a parentally-placed private school child with a disability designated to receive services.  The services plan also must, to the extent appropriate, meet the IEP content, development, review, and revision requirements described in section 614(d) of the Act, or, when appropriate, for children aged three through five, the IFSP requirements described in section 636(d) of the Act as to the services that are to be provided.

We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.

Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118 apply to all children with disabilities, including preschool children who are entitled to FAPE.  Public agencies that do not operate programs for preschool children without disabilities are not required to initiate those programs solely to satisfy the LRE requirements of the Act.  Public agencies that do not have an inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports must explore alternative methods to ensure that the LRE requirements are met.  Examples of such alternative methods might include placement options in private preschool programs or other community-based settings.  Paying for the placement of qualified preschool children with disabilities in a private preschool with children without disabilities is one, but not the only, option available to public agencies to meet the LRE requirements.  We believe the regulations should allow public agencies to choose an appropriate option to meet the LRE requirements.  However, if a public agency determines that placement in a private preschool program is necessary as a means of providing special education and related services to a child with a disability, the program must be at no cost to the parent of the child.</span></dd>

One commenter recommended removing the phrase "public school or seeking to enroll in public school" in Sec. 300.300(a)(3) to permit a public agency to override lack of parental consent for children who are home schooled or placed in a private school by parents at their own expense.</span></dd>

Public agencies do have an obligation to actively seek parental consent to evaluate children attending private schools (including children who are home schooled, if a home school is considered a private school under State law) who are suspected of being children with disabilities under the Act, in order to properly identify the number of private school children with disabilities and consider those children as eligible for equitable services under Sec. Sec. 300.132 through 300.144.  However, this obligation does not extend to overriding refusal of parental consent to evaluate parentally-placed private school children.</span></dd>

Concerning the comments asserting that parental revocation of 
consent for special education and related services could be detrimental 
to the academic future of a child with a disability, the Act presumes 
that a parent acts in the best interest of their child. If a child experiences academic difficulties after a parent revokes consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services, nothing 
in the Act or the implementing regulations would prevent a parent from 
requesting an evaluation to determine if the child is eligible, at that 
time, for special education and related services.

Discussion:  Section 300.172(a), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(A) of the Act, requires States to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner after the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  As noted in the discussion to the previous comment, the NIMAS is included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard and was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084).  The Department believes that States should make every effort to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner following the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register, recognizing that the timelines and requirements for adopting new rules, policies, or procedures vary from State to State.  States choosing to coordinate with the NIMAC must, consistent with section 612(a)(23)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.172(c) of these regulations, not later than December 3, 2006, as part of any print instructional materials adoption process, procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the publisher of the print instructional materials to:  (1) require the publisher to prepare and, on or before delivery of the print instructional materials, provide the NIMAC with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the NIMAS; or (2) purchase instructional materials from the publisher that are produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.  Clearly, we would expect that these States would have adopted the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  We decline to require a specific adoption date for all States, however, given the lack of specificity in the Act.  We also decline to include a definition of "adopt" in these regulations because requirements for adopting new rules and policies may vary from State to State.  The Department's view is that it is inherent in the adoption requirement that, at a minimum, upon "adoption" of the NIMAS, a State must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  Under Sec. 300.172(a), adopting the NIMAS is a State responsibility and does not impose any legal obligations on publishers of instructional materials.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</span></dd>

However, numerous commenters expressed concerns and objections to alternative route to certification programs for special education teachers.

One commenter stated that this provision is illogical and punitive to higher education teacher training programs because it allows individuals in an alternative route to certification program to be considered highly qualified and fully certified during their training program, while at the same time individuals in regular teacher training programs that meet the same requirements as alternative route to certification programs are not considered highly qualified or fully certified.  One commenter argued that an individual participating in an alternative route to certification program would need certification waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis, which means the individual has not met the requirements in Sec. 300.18(b)(1)(ii).

residing in a State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, except 
that public agencies are not required to serve children aged 3 through 
5 and aged 18 through 21 if serving such children is inconsistent with 
State law, practice or the order of any court with respect to the 
provision of public education to children of those ages. The child's 
parents, under the Act, are afforded rights regarding the provision of 
FAPE to their child, including the right to determine whether their 
child will receive special education and related services. 
Specifically, under section 614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) and (ii)(II) of the 
Act, a parent has the authority to determine whether a public agency 
may begin to provide special education and related services to their 
child. As discussed previously, it is the Department's position that a 
parent also should have the authority to revoke consent to the 
continued provision of special education and related services to their 
child. The Act presumes that parents act in the best interest of their 
child. Therefore, affording a parent the right to consent to the 
initial provision of special education and related services or the 
right to revoke consent, in writing, to the continued provision of 
special education and related services is consistent with the Act and 
does not undermine a child's right to FAPE under Sec.  300.101.

Discussion:  Section 300.226(b) follows the specific language in section 613(f)(2) of the Act and requires that in implementing coordinated, early intervening services, an LEA may provide, among other services, professional development for teachers and other personnel to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions.  The use of the term scientifically based in Sec. 300.226(b) is intended to be consistent with the definition of the term scientifically based research in section 9101(37) of the ESEA.  Because this definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion of new Sec. 300.35.  Under the definition, scientifically based research must be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal or approved by a panel of independent experts through a comparably rigorous, objective, and scientific review.  We expect that the professional development activities authorized under Sec. 300.226(b)(1) will be derived from scientifically based research.  The statute and regulations do not refer to "recommended practices," which is a term of art that, generally, refers to practices that the field has adopted as "best practices," and which may or may not be based on evidence from scientifically based research.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations in the manner requested by the commenter because the regulations already require that the standards be the same for all evaluators, as long as the agency's criteria for evaluators do not prohibit a parent from obtaining an IEE.  An IEE is defined in Sec. 300.502(a)(3)(i) as an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency responsible for the education of the child in question.  Section 300.502(e) provides that in order for an IEE to be at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with the parent's right to an IEE.  Except for these criteria, Sec. 300.502(e)(2) provides that a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense.  Consistent with applicable agency criteria, it would be appropriate for a public agency to require an IEE examiner to hold, or be eligible to hold, a particular license when a public agency requires the same licensure for personnel who conduct the same types of evaluations for the agency.  In contrast, it would be inconsistent with a parent's right to an IEE for a public agency to require all evaluators to be licensed, if only individuals employed by a public agency may obtain a license.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  As noted in the response to the prior comment, public agencies have a responsibility to ensure that a surrogate parent is carrying out their responsibilities, so there are some circumstances when removal may be appropriate.  A mere disagreement with the decisions of a surrogate parent about appropriate services or placements for the child, however, generally would not be sufficient to give rise to a removal, as the role of the surrogate parent is to represent the interests of the child, which may not be the same as the interests of the public agency.  We do not think a regulation is necessary, however, as we believe that the rights of the child with a disability are adequately protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II), which prohibit retaliation or coercion against any individual who exercises their rights under Federal law for the purpose of assisting children with disabilities by protecting rights protected under those statutes.  See, 34 CFR 104.61, referencing 34 CFR 100.7(e); 28 CFR 35.134.  These statutes generally prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance (Section 504) and prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by State and local governments (Title II).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.

Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.  However, there is nothing in these regulations that would prohibit school personnel, if they choose to do so, from including parents in the consultation.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</span></dd>

This plan must be developed no later than 90 days after the State reserves funds for a high cost fund.  Section 300.704(c)(3)(ii), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, requires a State to make its final State plan for the high cost fund available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year, including dissemination of such information on the State's Web site.  Although there is nothing in the Act that requires that the public be given the opportunity to comment on the State's plan, there also is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a State from providing an opportunity for public comment prior to finalizing the State's plan for the high cost fund.

Because fewer factors need to be considered during each manifestation determination review, the time required to conduct such reviews will likely be reduced, and some minimal savings may be realized.  However, the more significant impact relates to secondary effects.  Because it will be less burdensome for school personnel to conduct manifestation determinations, it is reasonable to expect an overall increase in the number of these reviews as school personnel take advantage of the streamlined process to pursue disciplinary actions against those children with disabilities who commit serious violations of student codes of conduct.  This prediction is consistent with a recent GAO report ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), which found that a "sizable minority of principals" voiced concern that discipline policies under previous law impeded proper disciplinary action for students with disabilities, and that some of these comments "may have stemmed from the additional time and resources that principals reportedly use to discipline special education students compared with regular education students."  Even more importantly, the changes in the law will make it easier for review team members to conclude that the behavior in question is not a manifestation of a child's disability, enabling school personnel to apply disciplinary sanctions in more cases involving children with disabilities.</span></dd>

Section 300.321(e)(1) permits certain members of the IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  The previous regulations required that all IEP Team meetings include the parents of the child, at least one regular education teacher (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), at least one special education teacher, a representative of the public agency, and someone who could interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results (who may be one of the other required IEP Team members).  The extent to which public agencies will realize savings from the final regulations depends on which team members are excused from how much of the meeting.  If the average IEP Team meeting lasts 1.5 hours and requires a half an hour of teacher preparation, then we estimate that the opportunity costs for a teacher of attending a meeting (based on average compensation per hour of $48) would be $96.  If we assume an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings are held for each of the 6.947 million children with disabilities, then 8.34 million IEP Team meetings will be held in 2006-2007.  If one teacher could be excused from five percent of these meetings, the final regulation could result in savings of $40 million.  </span></dd>

Requiring that the public agency provide an opportunity for the parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to voluntarily engage in mediation in an effort to resolve a dispute is an appropriate minimum requirement and consistent with the statutory provision in section 615(e) of the Act that voluntary mediation be made available to parties (i.e., parent and public agency) to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint.  However, the statute does not require that mediation be available to other parties, and we believe it would be burdensome to expand, through regulation, new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) to require that States offer mediation to non-parents.  Although we do not believe we should regulate to require that mediation be offered to non-parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude an SEA from permitting the use of mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, if available in the State, to resolve a State complaint filed by an organization or individual other than a parent, and we will add language to Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to permit extensions of the timeline if the parties are voluntarily engaged in any of these dispute resolution procedures.  In fact, we encourage SEAs and their public agencies to consider alternative means of resolving disputes between the public agency and organizations or other individuals, at the local level, consistent with State law and administrative procedures.  It is up to each State, however, to determine whether non-parents can use mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </span></dd>

We believe that an SEA, in resolving a complaint challenging the appropriateness of a child's educational program or services or the provision of FAPE, should not only determine whether the public agency has followed the required procedures to reach that determination, but also whether the public agency has reached a decision that is consistent with the requirements in Part B of the Act in light of the individual child's abilities and needs.  Thus, the SEA may need to review the evaluation data in the child's record, or any additional data provided by the parties to the complaint, and the explanation included in the public agency's notice to the parent as to why the agency made the determination regarding the child's educational program or services.  If necessary, the SEA may need to interview appropriate individuals, to determine whether the agency followed procedures and applied standards that are consistent with State standards, including the requirements of Part B of the Act, and whether the determination made by the public agency is consistent with those standards and supported by the data.  The SEA may, in its effort to resolve a complaint, determine that interviews with appropriate individuals are necessary for the SEA to obtain the relevant information needed to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or of part 300.  However, such interviews conducted by the SEA, as part of its effort to resolve a State complaint, are not intended to be comparable to the requirement in section 615(h)(2) of the Act, which provides any party to a due process hearing the right to present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  The definition of social work services in schools in the 1977 regulations included "mobilizing school and community resources to enable the child to receive maximum benefit from his or her educational program."  As explained in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations, the phrase "to receive maximum benefit" was intended only to provide that the purpose of activities carried out by personnel qualified to provide social work services in schools is to mobilize resources so that a child can learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program.  The language in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations also clarified that this provision did not set a legal standard for that program or entitle the child to a particular educational benefit.  The preamble further explained that, during the public comment period for the 1992 regulations, commenters raised concerns that the term "maximum benefit" appeared to be inconsistent with the decision by the United States Supreme Court in Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982).  Therefore, the phrase was revised to read "to learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program."  This is the same phrase used in the 1999 regulations and in these regulations in Sec. 300.34(c)(14)(iv).  Because the language in the 1977 final regulations did not entitle a child to any particular benefit, the change made in 1992 did not lessen protections for a child, and, therefore, is not subject to section 607(b) of the Act. </span></dd>

Concerning the comments about written notice of the receipt of a 
parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue 
services and the comment concerning an opportunity to meet with the 
State's PTI center to receive additional information about the 
potential effect of the parent's decision, we have not adopted 
additional procedures for parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services because the regulations already provide 
sufficient notice protections to enable parents to understand the 
implications of the decision they are making. To clarify this point, we 
have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to specify that prior written 
notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 be provided to parents before a 
public agency discontinues special education and related services to 
their child. Public agencies, under Sec.  300.503, are required to give 
the parents of a child with a disability written notice that meets the 
requirements in Sec.  300.503(b) within a reasonable time before the 
public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the 
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or 
the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the 
child. Once a public agency receives a parent's written revocation of 
consent for a child's receipt of special education and related 
services, the public agency, under Sec.  300.503, must provide prior 
written notice to the parent regarding the change in educational 
placement and services that will result from the revocation of consent. 
The notice must include, among other matters, information on sources 
for the parents to contact that can assist the parents in understanding 
the requirements of Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations. 
Section 300.503(c)(1)(i) also requires that this prior notice be 
written in language understandable to the general public. It is 
imperative that the public agency provide the required prior notice in 
a meaningful manner. Accordingly, Sec.  300.503(c)(1)(ii) requires that 
any notice required by Sec.  300.503 must be provided in the native 
language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the 
parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. Additionally, if 
the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a 
written language, Sec.  300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to 
take additional measures to communicate the information contained in 
the notice. These measures involve taking steps to ensure that the 
notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in the 
parent's native language or other mode of communication, that the 
parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written 
evidence that the requirements of Sec.  300.503(c) have been met.

Comment: Several commenters supported proposed Sec.  300.512

process hearings is best decided by State law. Other commenters 
disagreed with our statement in the preamble to the NPRM that the 
language of the Act is not clear about whether non-attorneys can 
represent parties in due process hearings. These commenters stated that 
the Act and its implementing regulations both provide that any party to 
a hearing shall be accorded the right to be accompanied and advised 
``by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with 
respect to the problems of children with disabilities * * *.'' The 
commenters stated that because the term ``counsel'' is referenced 
separately and distinguished from ``individuals with special knowledge 
or training'' in both the Act and the regulations, the Department 
should conclude that such ``individuals'' may, in fact, be other than 
counsel (i.e., attorneys) and represent a parent in a due process 
hearing. One commenter noted that experienced advocates can be very 
helpful to parents who represent themselves in due process hearings. 
Another commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 should not permit 
a State's rules related to the unauthorized practice of law to prohibit 
a parent from being ``accompanied and advised'' by a lay advocate 
because this would be contrary to the actual text of the Act. Moreover, 
several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 violates the 
intent of the Act, which they describe as providing parents with the 
broadest opportunities for assistance in due process hearings. These

While we agree with the commenters that some areas of noncompliance 
are more difficult to correct than others, we do not agree that the 
timeline should be extended beyond one year. Our experience has been 
that most States can correct noncompliance, including noncompliance 
that is spread broadly across a system, in less than one year from 
identification of the noncompliance. For example, States have required 
the implementation of short-term correction strategies while they are 
developing and implementing a plan for long-term change to ensure 
sustained compliance. An example of a short-term correction strategy 
coupled with a longer-term change might include contracting with speech 
therapists to provide the speech pathology services needed by current 
students while developing an in-district program to support speech 
pathology assistants to become certified speech language pathologists. 
Therefore, Sec.  300.600(e) provides an appropriate timeline for 
correcting noncompliance, including systemic and long-standing 
noncompliance. In cases where a State is unable to correct 
noncompliance within one year of identification, as provided in Sec.  
300.600(e), a State may enter into a compliance agreement with the 
Department under section 457 of GEPA (Compliance Agreement), if the 
Department deems a Compliance Agreement appropriate. The purpose of a 
Compliance Agreement is to allow a State the time needed to correct 
long-standing systemic noncompliance and come into full compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the Federal program as soon as feasible, 
but not later than three years from the date of the Compliance 
Agreement. A Compliance Agreement allows a State to continue to receive 
its grant award under Part B of the Act while it works toward achieving 
full compliance under the terms of the agreement. Section 300.600(e), 
when read together with the provisions in section 457 of GEPA, 
adequately address the commenters' concerns.

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern with allowing high school students with significant cognitive disabilities to be taught by a certified elementary school teacher.  One commenter stated that high school students with disabilities should be prepared to lead productive adult lives, and not be treated as young children.  Another commenter stated that these requirements foster low expectations for children with the most significant cognitive disabilities and will be used to justify providing children with instruction that is not age appropriate or that denies access to the general education curriculum.  A few commenters stated that the requirements for special education teachers teaching to alternate achievement standards should be the same as the requirements for all special education teachers.  </span></dd>

The Department's nonregulatory guidance on "Highly Qualified Teachers, Improving Teacher Quality State Grants" (August 3, 2005) explains that if a State issues a composite social studies license, the State must determine in which of the four areas (history, geography, economics, and civics and government), if any, a teacher is qualified.

The commenters recommended requiring LEAs to report to the State the number of children with disabilities who qualified for, but were not given a three-year reevaluation; provide prior written notice to parents if the LEA determines that a three-year reevaluation is not necessary, including the justification for such determination; and inform the parent in writing in the parent's language that a three-year reevaluation will be conducted if the parent disagrees with the LEA's determination.  </span></dd>

Comment:  Several commenters expressed concern about allowing States to decide on the approach to determining whether a child has an SLD, and requested the Department develop criteria to be used across the nation.  However, numerous commenters supported the development of State criteria and requiring public agencies to use the State criteria to determine whether a child has an SLD.

States that change their eligibility criteria for SLD may want to carefully consider the reevaluation of children found eligible for special education services using prior procedures.  States should consider the effect of exiting a child from special education who has received special education and related services for many years and how the removal of such supports will affect the child's educational progress, particularly for a child who is in the final year(s) of high school.  Obviously, the group should consider whether the child's instruction and overall special education program have been appropriate as part of this process.  If the special education instruction has been appropriate and the child has not been able to exit special education, this would be strong evidence that the child's eligibility needs to be maintained.</span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.307(a)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(4)) recognizes that there are alternative models to identify children with SLD that are based on sound scientific research and gives States flexibility to use these models.  For example, a State could choose to identify children based on absolute low achievement and consideration of exclusionary factors as one criterion for eligibility.  Other alternatives might combine features of different models for identification.  We believe the evaluation procedures in section 614(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Act give the Department the flexibility to allow States to use alternative, research-based procedures for determining whether a child has an SLD and is eligible for special education and related services.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Watering down a focus on appropriate instruction for any children, including children with disabilities or children living in rural areas would be counter to both the Act and the ESEA.

Discussion:  Section 300.502(c)(1) imposes an affirmative obligation on a public agency to consider the results of a parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in any decision regarding the provision of FAPE to the child, if that evaluation meets agency criteria.  The requirement, however, does not mean that the public agency is compelled to consider the parent-initiated evaluation at private expense in its decision regarding the provision of FAPE, if it does not meet agency criteria.  If the agency believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria, it would be appropriate for the agency to explain to the parent why it believes that the parent-initiated evaluation does not meet agency criteria. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.321(a)(7) includes the child as a member of the IEP Team, when appropriate, and Sec. 300.321(b)(1) requires the public agency to invite the child to the child's IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals.  Further, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.

Discussion:  The Act has never given public agencies the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services for a child with a disability, including when the requirements in Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) were in effect.  Without the authority to compel other agencies to participate in the planning of transition services, public agencies have not been able to meet the requirement in current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii) to "ensure" the participation of other agencies in transition planning.  Therefore, while we believe that public agencies should take steps to obtain the participation of other agencies in the planning of transition services for a child, we believe it is unhelpful to retain current Sec. 300.344(b)(3)(ii). </span></dd>

States are free to have additional indicators that are not included in the State performance plan and these indicators would not need to have measurable and rigorous targets.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.602 already include the requirement suggested by the commenter.  Section 300.602, consistent with section 616(b)(2)(C) of the Act, requires each State to use the targets established in its State performance plan and the monitoring priority areas described in Sec. 300.600(d), to analyze the performance of each LEA in the State, and to report annually to the public on such performance.  As described in new Sec. 300.600(d), the monitoring priority areas on which the State will report include the disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services, to the extent the disproportionate representation is the result of inappropriate identification.  Accordingly, States are required to report this information to the public.  States must establish targets on each of the indicators set by the Secretary.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We agree that the public should be represented in developing State performance plans.  In note 253-258 of the Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 232, Congress stated its expectation that State performance plans, indicators, and targets be developed with broad stakeholder input and public dissemination.  OSEP Memo 05-12 requires States to provide information in the overview section of the State performance plan, clarifying how the State obtained broad input from stakeholders on the State performance plan.  Furthermore, Sec. Sec. 300.167 through 300.169 clarify the State's responsibility to establish and maintain an advisory panel, whose membership consists of broad and diverse representation, to advise States on many issues, including developing evaluations and reporting on data to the Secretary.

The Secretary acknowledges that the final regulations could create additional costs for parents of children who, but for this change, would not have been subject to disciplinary removals, to the extent that such parents disagree with the manifestation determination and choose to appeal it.

The previous regulations required a school district to conduct an evaluation of each child served under the Act every three years to determine, among other things, whether the child was still eligible for special education.

Section 300.303(b)(2) permits districts to dispense with the triennial evaluation when the child's parents and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.

Comment:  A few commenters expressed concern that parents who place their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools outside the district of residence, and who are determined by the LEA where the private schools are located, through its child find process, to be children with disabilities eligible for special education and related services, would have no knowledge of the special education and related services available for their children if they choose to attend a public school in their district of residence.  A few commenters suggested clarifying the obligation of the LEA where the private school is located to provide the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally-placed private school child. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Department believes it would not be appropriate to include the requested language in this section because services in these circumstances are provided under somewhat different criteria than is normally the case.  Section 300.530 clarifies the procedures school personnel must follow when removing a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from their current placement (e.g., suspension and expulsion).  This includes how decisions are made regarding the educational services the child receives and the location in which they will be provided.  School officials need some reasonable amount of flexibility in providing services to children with disabilities who have violated school conduct rules, and should not necessarily have to provide exactly the same services, in the same settings, to these children.  Therefore, we decline to regulate further in this regard.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: While the dispute resolution mechanisms in section 615 
of the Act generally are appropriate to resolve disputes between a 
parent and the public agency, it is the Department's position that they 
are not appropriate when a parent revokes consent for all special 
education and related services. Section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 
Sec.  300.507 allow a parent or public agency to file a due process 
complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, and 
educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of FAPE to the child. However, section 
614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act does not allow an LEA to use the due 
process procedures under section 615 of the Act, including mediation, 
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of 
services. If an LEA cannot use the due process procedures in section 
615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 to override a parent's 
refusal to provide initial consent for services, then an LEA also 
should not be allowed to use these due process procedures to override a 
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of services. 
As discussed throughout this preamble, the Secretary believes that 
protecting the interest of parents to make the decision as to whether 
or not their child receives special education and related services is 
consistent with the intent of the Act.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department does not believe that an assessment of psychological or cognitive processing should be required in determining whether a child has an SLD.  There is no current evidence that such assessments are necessary or sufficient for identifying SLD.  Further, in many cases, these assessments have not been used to make appropriate intervention decisions.  However, Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits, but does not require, consideration of a pattern of strengths or weaknesses, or both, relative to intellectual development, if the evaluation group considers that information relevant to an identification of SLD.  In many cases, though, assessments of cognitive processes simply add to the testing burden and do not contribute to interventions.  As summarized in the research consensus from the OSEP Learning Disability Summit (Bradley, Danielson, and Hallahan, 2002), "Although processing deficits have been linked to some SLD (e.g., phonological processing and reading), direct links with other processes have not been established.  Currently, available methods for measuring many processing difficulties are inadequate.  Therefore, systematically measuring processing difficulties and their link to treatment is not yet feasible....Processing deficits should be eliminated from the criteria for classification...." (p. 797).3  Concerns about the absence of evidence for relations of cognitive discrepancy and SLD for identification go back to Bijou (1942;4 see Kavale, 2002)5.  Cronbach (1957)6 characterized the search for aptitude by treatment interactions as a "hall of mirrors," a situation that has not improved over the past few years as different approaches to assessment of cognitive processes have emerged (Fletcher et al., 2005; Reschly and Tilly, 1999)7.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.504(a), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, requires a public agency to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice at least one time in a school year and under the exceptional circumstances specified in Sec. 300.504(a), which includes the first occurrence of the filing of a due process complaint in a school year.  The procedural safeguards notice, which must be written in language understandable to the general public and in the native language of the parent, unless clearly not feasible to do so, must include a full explanation of the Act's procedural safeguards.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, Sec. 300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means for the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.  Under Sec. 300.504(c)(5)(ii), the notice must inform parents about the opportunity to present and resolve a due process complaint in accordance with the resolution process required in Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, including a party's right to void the resolution agreement within three business days of execution.

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that requiring that a child's behavior must be a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under proposed paragraph (b) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) should be removed.  We believe it is sufficient for the public agency to conclude that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of removals that total more than 10 school days in a school year, the behaviors are substantially similar in nature, and such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another support the premise that the series of removals constitute a pattern.  However, our removal of the manifestation determination under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) does not eliminate the obligation to conduct a manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e) if the public agency's determination is that the series of removals constitutes a change in placement.

Discussion: Section 300.815, consistent with section 619(g) of the

public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that are

years and have established their eligibility under section 613 of the

Indicator 15 in the SPP measures the effectiveness of a State's 
general supervision by determining the percentage of noncompliance that

longstanding position, as reflected in Indicator 15 of the SPP, that 
when a State identifies noncompliance with the requirements of Part B 
of the Act by its LEAs, the noncompliance must be corrected as soon as 
possible, and in no case later than one year after the State identifies 
the noncompliance. The Department has established a target of 100 
percent for Indicator 15, meaning States are expected to correct 100 
percent of noncompliance as soon as possible, and in no case later than 
one year. Further, in our experience, when a State makes a good faith 
effort to correct noncompliance, the needed corrective actions can be 
accomplished and their effectiveness verified within one year. Finally, 
we expect that in the limited circumstances where correction does not 
occur within one year of the State's identification, the State will 
take specific enforcement actions with the LEA that are designed to 
achieve compliance. Section 300.600(e) is consistent with the 
Department's policy and guidance concerning the State's monitoring and 
enforcement responsibilities under Part B of the Act and the reporting

Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.

Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.

Parental consent requires, among other things, that the parent be fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, consistent with Sec. 300.9.  Thus, there is no need to change "parental consent" to "informed consent," as recommended by one commenter.  However, we believe it would avoid confusion for the references to "consent" in paragraphs (d) and (e) in Sec. 300.154 to be consistent.  Therefore, we will add a reference to Sec. 300.9 in Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv)(A) and delete "informed" from Sec. 300.154(e)(1).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although Congress did not specifically detail a State complaint process in the Act, we believe that the State complaint process is fully supported by the Act and necessary for the proper implementation of the Act and these regulations.  We believe a strong State complaint system provides parents and other individuals an opportunity to resolve disputes early without having to file a due process complaint and without having to go to a due process hearing.  The State complaint procedures are referenced in the following three separate sections of the Act:  (1) Section 611(e)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, which requires that States spend a portion of the amount of Part B funds that they can use for State-level activities on complaint investigations; (2) Section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act, which provides that nothing in that paragraph creates a private right of action for the failure of an SEA or LEA staff person to be highly qualified or prevents a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, as provided for under this part; and (3) Section 615(f)(3)(F) of the Act, which states that "[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the right of a parent to file a complaint with the State educational agency."  Paragraph (f)(3) is titled "Limitations on Hearing" and addresses issues such as the statute of limitations and that hearing issues are limited to the issues that the parent has raised in their due process notice.  The Senate Report explains that this provision clarifies that "nothing in section 615 shall be construed to affect a parent's right to file a complaint with the State educational agency, including complaints of procedural violations" (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 41).</span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to retain in the regulations the requirements in current Sec. Sec. 300.280 through 300.284 because the provisions in Sec. 300.165 and GEPA, in 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(7), provide sufficient opportunities for public participation.  We also believe retaining the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.280 through 300.284 would place unnecessary regulatory burden on States.  Section 300.165(a) incorporates the language in section 612(a)(19) of the Act, regarding public participation in the adoption of policies and procedures to implement Part B of the Act, and requires States to ensure that there are public hearings, adequate notice of hearings, and an opportunity for comment available to the general public.  Furthermore, paragraph (b) of this section requires States to comply with the public participation requirements of GEPA, in 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(7), before submitting a State plan under this part.  In accordance with the GEPA requirement, the State must assure that it will provide reasonable opportunities for participation by local agencies, representatives of the class of individuals affected by programs under this part and other interested institutions, organizations, and individuals in the planning for the operation of programs under this part.  GEPA also requires that the State publish each proposed State plan under this part, in a manner that will ensure circulation throughout the State, at least 60 days prior to the date on which the State plan is submitted to the Secretary or on which the State plan becomes effective, whichever occurs earlier, with an opportunity for public comments on such plan to be accepted for at least 30 days.  In addition, the State must comply with any State-specific public participation requirements in adopting policies and procedures related to Part B of the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the regulations place great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum.  New Sec. 300.39(b)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(3)) defines specially designed instruction as adapting the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of the child and to ensure access to the general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.  In addition, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general curriculum is a major focus of the requirements for developing a child's IEP.  For example, Sec. 300.320(a)(1) requires a child's IEP to include a statement of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i) requires annual IEP goals to be designed to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services the child will receive, as well as the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided, to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

Discussion:  The definition of interpreting services clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The nature and type of interpreting services required for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and also limited in English proficiency are to be determined by reference to the Department's regulations and policies regarding students with limited English proficiency.  For example, the Department's regulations in 34 CFR part 100, implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, require that recipients of Federal financial assistance ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by students who are limited English proficient, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The requirement to provide services to students who are limited English proficient and others is also governed by various Department policy memoranda including the September 27, 1991 memorandum, "Department of Education Policy Update on Schools' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students With Limited English Proficiency;" the December 3, 1985 guidance document, "The Office for Civil Rights' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures;" and the May 1970 memorandum to school districts, "Identification of discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin," 35 FR 11595.

Discussion:  The Department's policy on flexibility for middle and high school teachers in rural schools applies to special education teachers.

The language in the regulations also recognizes that similar restrictions may exist in State regulations or in contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent, and should be accorded similar deference.  We believe it is essential for LEAs to have knowledge of State laws, regulations, and any contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent to ensure that the requirements in Sec. 300.30(a)(2) are properly implemented.  States and LEAs should develop procedures to make this information more readily and easily available so that LEAs do not have to engage in extensive fact finding each time a child with a foster parent enrolls in a school.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.8(b) states that the use of the developmental delay category for a child with a disability aged three through nine, or any subset of that age range, must be made in accordance with Sec. 300.111(b).  Section 300.111(b) gives States the option of adopting a definition of developmental delay, but does not require an LEA to adopt and use the term.  However, if an LEA uses the category of developmental delay, the LEA must conform to both the State's definition of the term and the age range that has been adopted by the State.  If a State does not adopt the category of developmental delay, an LEA may not use that category as the basis for establishing a child's eligibility for special education and related services.  	Based on the comments, it appears that Sec. 300.8(b) has been misinterpreted as stating that LEAs are allowed to establish the age range for defining developmental delay independent of the State.

New Sec. 300.307(a)(2) (proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(3)) requires States to permit the use of a process that examines whether the child responds to scientific, research-based interventions as part of the information reviewed to determine whether a child has an SLD.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.505(c)(2), which requires a public agency to document the specific reasonable measures it has taken to obtain parental consent for a reevaluation, including detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; copies of any correspondence sent to the parents and any responses received; and detailed records of visits made to the parents' home or place of employment and the results of those visits.  One commenter suggested that if the requirements in current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) were not retained, the regulations should define reasonable measures as at least three good-faith attempts to contact a parent.  Many commenters stated that current Sec. 300.505(c)(2) must be retained because it is protected by section 607(b) of the Act, which provides that the Secretary may not publish final regulations that would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to children with disabilities in the regulations that were in effect on July 20, 1983. </span></dd>

Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern about new Sec. 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)), which provides that if a parent fails to consent for initial services or refuses to respond to a request for consent, the public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for the child.  A few commenters stated that this should be permitted only when a parent refuses services, but not when a parent fails to respond to a request for consent for initial services.  A few commenters stated that the regulations should be revised to clarify that this applies only to subsequent IEP Team meetings, not the initial IEP Team meeting.  One commenter recommended revising the regulations to require an IEP Team meeting to be held and an IEP developed to provide a basis for informed consent. </span></dd>

While the notice required under Sec.  300.503 provides sufficient 
information to parents regarding revocation of consent for special 
education and related services, a State may choose to establish 
additional procedures for implementing Sec.  300.300(b)(4), such as 
requiring a public agency to offer to meet with parents to discuss 
concerns for their child's education. However, the State must ensure 
that any additional procedures are voluntary for the parents, do not 
delay or deny the discontinuation of special education and related 
services, and are otherwise consistent with the requirements under Part 
B of the Act and its implementing regulations. For example, while a 
public agency may inquire as to why a parent is revoking consent for 
special education and related services, a public agency may not require 
a parent to provide an explanation, either orally or in writing, prior 
to ceasing the provision of special education and related services.

Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent at any time after 
the initial provision of special education and related services to 
revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services to their child in their entirety. Under Sec.  
300.300(b)(1), parental consent is for the initial provision of special 
education and related services generally, not for a particular service 
or services. Once a public agency receives a parental revocation of 
consent, in writing, for all special education and related services for 
a child and provides prior written notice in accordance with Sec.  
300.503, the public agency must, within a reasonable time, discontinue 
all special education and related services to the child. In this 
circumstance, the public agency may not use the procedures in subpart E 
of these regulations, including the mediation procedures under Sec.  
300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec.  300.507 through 
300.516, to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be 
provided to the child.

Comment: Some commenters asked how proposed Sec.  300.300(b)(4) 
will affect a school district's adequate yearly progress (AYP) 
reporting under the ESEA and whether children who previously received 
special education and related services would be counted in the special 
education subgroup. The commenters requested clarification as to 
whether the student will remain in the students with disabilities 
subgroup if services are discontinued after school has begun but before 
the State assessment is administered and whether or not the State will 
be required to provide accommodations on assessments to the student. 
Another commenter expressed concern that teachers will be blamed if a 
child fails to succeed after a parent revokes consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services because educators 
are ``liable'' for all students under the ESEA. One commenter expressed 
concern about an LEA's and State's ability to accurately track the 
progress of students with disabilities over time, especially if large 
numbers of parents choose to exercise their right to revoke consent. 
Lastly, another commenter expressed concern that a parent who 
unilaterally withdraws his or her child from special education and 
related services may sue an LEA if a student fails to make progress.

The methods by which a public agency seeks to obtain parental consent for an initial evaluation (beyond the requirement that the public agency use the parent's native language or mode of communication) and how a public agency documents its efforts to obtain the parent's written consent are appropriately left to the discretion of SEAs and LEAs.</span></dd>

	We also do not believe that additional regulations are necessary to require public agencies to inform parents of the consequences of withholding consent for an initial evaluation or to provide parents with copies of the Act.  Section 300.503, consistent with section 615(c)(1) of the Act, already requires that prior written notice be provided to parents before an initial evaluation, which will explain, among other things, why the agency is proposing to conduct the evaluation; a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as a basis for proposing to conduct the evaluation; and sources for the parent to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions under the Act.  Additionally, Sec. 300.504(a)(1), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, requires the public agency to provide a copy of the procedural safeguards to parents upon initial referral for an evaluation, which provides information about parents' rights under the Act.  Although we do not believe the recommended requirements should be added to the regulations, we will add the cross-references to the consent requirements in Sec. 300.9, and the requirements for prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice in Sec.

	We also agree with the commenters that a public agency should document and make the same reasonable efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation from a parent, including a parent of a child who is a ward of the State, that are required when a public agency attempts to arrange a mutually convenient time and place for an IEP Team meeting (e.g., detailed records of telephone calls, any correspondence sent to the parents, visits made to the parent's home or place of employment), and will add a new paragraph (d)(5) to make this clear.  We recognize that the statute uses both "reasonable measures" and "reasonable efforts" when referring to a public agency's responsibility to obtain parental consent for an evaluation, initial services, and a reevaluation.

Discussion:  The Act does not restrict the use of funds for early intervening services only to LEAs that can demonstrate that all eligible children with disabilities are receiving FAPE.  Section 613(f)(1) of the Act generally permits LEAs to use funds for early intervening services for children in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on children in kindergarten through grade 3) who have not been identified as needing special education or related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment.  No other restrictions on this authority, such as a requirement that the LEA first demonstrate that it is providing FAPE to all eligible children, are specified or appropriate.  The authority to use some Part B funds for early intervening services has the potential to benefit special education, as well as the education of other children, by reducing academic and behavioral problems in the regular educational environment and reducing the number of referrals to special education that could have been avoided by relatively simple regular education interventions.  Therefore, we believe the use of Part B funds for early intervening services should be encouraged, rather than restricted.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The link between reductions in local maintenance of effort (reflected in Sec. 300.205(d)) and the amount of Part B funds that LEAs may use to provide early intervening services (reflected in Sec. 300.226) is established in the Act.  Section 300.205(d) tracks the statutory language in section 613(a)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act and Sec. 300.226(a) tracks the statutory language in section 613(f)(1) of the Act.  Section 300.205(d) states that the amount of funds expended by an LEA for early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 counts toward the maximum amount of expenditures that an LEA may reduce in its local maintenance of effort.  Section 300.226(a) clearly states that the amount of Part B funds an LEA may use to provide early intervening services may not exceed 15 percent of the funds the LEA receives under Part B of the Act less any amount reduced by the LEA under Sec. 300.205. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We are not removing "consecutive" from Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536, as recommended by the commenters, because the Department has long interpreted the Act to permit children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct to be removed from their current educational placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days at a time, and that additional removals of 10 consecutive school days or less in the same school year would be possible, as long as any removal does not constitute a change in placement.  We do not believe the changes to section 615(k) of the Act justify any change in this position.  Further, the Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 43, which states that "a school may order a change in placement for a child who violates a code of student conduct to an appropriate interim educational setting, another setting, or suspension, for 10 consecutive school days or less, to the same extent that it would apply such a discipline measure to a child without a disability."</span></dd>

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations allow parents to continue to serve as the decision-maker and to retain the rights under the Act even in situations where the child is not determined to be incompetent under State law, if the student and parent agree in writing that the parent retains such rights.  The commenter stated that a State may not have a mechanism to determine that the child does not have the ability to provide informed consent, as required in Sec. 300.520(b), and if a State does have such a mechanism, it may be costly and time consuming for a parent to go to court to retain such rights.

Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.  The intent of Congress in revising section 615(k)(5) of the Act was to "ensure that schools can appropriately discipline students, while maintaining protections for students whom the school had valid reason to know had a disability" and that the provisions in the Act should not have the "unintended consequence of providing a shield against the ability of a school district to be able to appropriately discipline a student."  (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 46).  We are not including time restrictions, as suggested by the commenters, to the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section because we believe such restrictions are unnecessary and could have the unintended consequence of hindering the school's ability to appropriately discipline a child.  We believe the basis of knowledge provision in Sec. 300.534(b) is sufficient to ensure that a school had valid reason to know that a child may need special education and related services.</span></dd>

We continue to believe the child find and special education referral system is an important function of schools, LEAs, and States.  School personnel should refer children for evaluation through the agency's child or special education referral system when the child's behavior or performance indicates that they may have a disability covered under the Act.  Having the teacher of a child (or other personnel) express his or her concerns regarding a child in accordance with the agency's established child find or referral system helps ensure that the concerns expressed are specific, rather than casual comments, regarding the behaviors demonstrated by the child and indicate that the child may be a child with a disability under the Act.  For these reasons, we would encourage those States and LEAs whose child find or referral processes do not permit teachers to express specific concerns directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency, to change these processes to meet this requirement.</span></dd>

We also recognize, though, that as a matter of practice, it makes a great deal of sense to attend to behavior of children with disabilities that is interfering with their education or that of others, so that the behavior can be addressed, even when that behavior will not result in a change in placement.  In fact, the Act emphasizes a proactive approach to behaviors that interfere with learning by requiring that, for children with disabilities whose behavior impedes their learning or that of others, the IEP Team consider, as appropriate, and address in the child's IEP, "the use of positive behavioral interventions, and other strategies to address the behavior."  (See section 614(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act).  This provision should ensure that children who need behavior intervention plans to succeed in school receive them.  For these reasons, we decline to make the changes suggested. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.  We believe that, on the one hand, it would be unreasonably burdensome to read the term as applying to every imposition of discipline, including those that might not result in the child being removed from the regular educational environment at all.  On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.  Therefore, we agree with those commenters who suggested that paragraph (h) of this section should be amended to clarify that the requirement for parental notification applies to a removal that constitutes a change in placement of a child with a disability for a violation of a code of student conduct.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act no longer requires that the appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement be considered when making a manifestation determination.

However, Sec. 300.532, consistent with section 615(k)(3) of the Act, does provide that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), may request an expedited due process hearing, which must occur within 20 school days of the date the hearing is requested and must result in a determination within 10 school days after the hearing.  </span></dd>

The cost of demonstrating subject area competence depends on the number of special education teachers who teach core academic subjects exclusively to children assessed against alternate achievement standards, the number of these teachers who already would be considered highly qualified under section 9101(23) of the ESEA and the number who would not, and the cost of helping special education teachers who are not highly qualified meet the highly qualified teacher requirements for teaching core academic subjects at the middle and high school levels (or replacing them with highly qualified teachers).  The final regulations will generate savings for public agencies to the extent that the cost of helping teachers demonstrate subject area competence at the elementary level and obtain the knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to teach to alternate achievement standards is lower than the cost of demonstrating subject matter competence at the level (middle or high school) at which they are teaching.</span></dd>

According to State-reported data collected by the Department's Office of Special Education Programs, certification or licensure requirements have been waived for eight percent of special education teachers, or approximately 30,000 teachers.  If States and districts respond to the statutory change reflected in the final regulations by hiring certified teachers to fill these positions, it could cost well over $1 billion to cover the salaries for a single year. (Occupational Employment and Wages Survey, November 2004, indicates a median national salary of $44,330 for elementary school teachers and $46,300 for secondary school teachers.)  However, given that the Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education (SPENSE) found that in 1999-2000, 12,241 positions for special education teachers were left vacant or filled by substitute teachers because suitable candidates could not be found, it is unlikely that States and districts can meet this requirement through hiring.  </span></dd>

States and districts are unlikely to be able to meet these requirements entirely through reciprocity agreements and college and university programs.  The above estimates involve fewer than 7,000 of the approximately 30,000 teachers who lack full certification.  Other options States and districts might use to certify the more than 23,000 remaining teachers include assessments of academic skill and subject matter knowledge and professional development.  Assessment requirements for special education teachers vary across States and teaching assignment fields, but most States require at least two subject matter tests, a general test on core content knowledge, and a disability-specific test, for special education teacher certification.  The average cost of each test is $75.  The SPENSE study found that one-fourth of beginning special education teachers who took a certification test reported having to take it more than once before passing.  If States and districts certified the remaining 23,000 teachers through existing assessments and 25 percent of the teachers took the tests twice, the cost would be approximately $4.3 million.  </span></dd>

When changes to a child's IEP are needed after the annual IEP Team meeting for the school year has been held, Sec. 300.324(a)(4) allows the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency to agree to forego a meeting and develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  Under the previous regulations, the IEP Team was required to reconvene in order to make amendments to an IEP.  Based on our estimate of an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings per child per year, approximately 1.4 million IEP Team meetings beyond the required annual IEP Team meeting would be held during the 2006-2007 school year.  If half of these meetings concerned amendments or modifications to an IEP and parents and agency representatives agreed to forego a meeting and develop a written document in half of these cases, then 350,000 IEP Team meetings would not be needed.  The combined opportunity costs for personnel participating in a typical IEP Team meeting are estimated at $307.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to specify in the regulations how the SEA should handle a complaint filed against the SEA because Sec. 300.151 clarifies that, if an organization or individual files a complaint, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, the SEA must resolve the complaint.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.33 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, the term public agency includes the SEA.  The SEA must, therefore, resolve any complaint against the SEA pursuant to the SEA's adopted State complaint procedures.  The SEA, however, may either appoint its own personnel to resolve the complaint, or may make arrangements with an outside party to resolve the complaint.  If it chooses to use an outside party, however, the SEA remains responsible for complying with all procedural and remediation steps required in part 300.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(vi)(I) of the Act, equitable services must be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by the public agency with an individual, association, agency, organization, or other entity.  Section 300.142(a) provides that an LEA may use Part B funds to make public school personnel available in other than public facilities to the extent necessary to provide equitable services for parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools and if those services are not otherwise provided by the private school to children as a benefit provided to all children attending that school.  Under Sec. 300.142(b), an LEA may use Part B funds to pay for the services of an employee of a private school to provide equitable services if the employee performs the services outside of his or her regular hours of duty and the employee performs the services under public supervision and control.

Section 300.156(b)(2)(iii), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(B)(iii) of the Act, does specifically allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, regulation, or written policy, to assist in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities under the Act.  However, this provision should not be construed to permit or encourage the use of paraprofessionals as a replacement for teachers or related services providers who meet State qualification standards.  To the contrary, using paraprofessionals and assistants as teachers or related services providers would be inconsistent with the State's duty to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Paraprofessionals in public schools are not directly responsible for the provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities; rather, these aides provide special education and related services to children with disabilities only under the supervision of special education and related services personnel.  We believe the provision in Sec. 300.156(b)(2)(iii) sufficiently ensures that paraprofessionals and assistants are adequately supervised and further clarification in these regulations is unnecessary.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Current Sec. 300.155 was removed from these regulations consistent with section 612(a)(17) of the Act.

To alleviate burden, Congress removed the statutory provisions which required that States have policies and procedures on file with the Secretary to ensure that funds paid to the State under Part B of the Act are spent in accordance with the provisions of Part B.  OSEP continues to have responsibility to ensure that States are properly implementing the Act.

Discussion:  School health services was retained in the definition of related services in Sec. 300.34(a).  However, the definition of school health services was inadvertently removed in the NPRM.  To correct this error, we will add school health services to the definition of school nurse services and clarify that school health services and school nurse services means health services that are designed to enable a child with a disability to receive FAPE.  We will also add language to clarify that school nurse services are provided by a qualified school nurse and that school health services are provided by either a qualified school nurse or other qualified person.  We recognize that most schools do not have a qualified school nurse on a full-time basis (i.e., a nurse that meets the State standards for a qualified school nurse), and that many schools rely on other qualified school personnel to provide school health services under the direction of a school nurse.  Therefore, we believe it is important to retain the definition of school health services and school nurse services in these regulations.</span></dd>

In addition, the obligation of the LEA to spend a proportionate amount of funds to provide services to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools is now based on the total number of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools located in the LEA whether or not the children and their parents reside in the LEA.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act does not require that children with disabilities suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons continue to be educated with children who are not disabled during the period of their removal.  We believe it is important to ensure that children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled from school receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to remove a child from school, when necessary, and to determine how best to address the child's needs during periods of removal and where services are to be provided to the child during such periods of removals, including, if appropriate, home instruction.  Sections 300.530 through 300.536 address the options available to school authorities in disciplining children with disabilities and set forth procedures that must be followed when taking disciplinary actions and in making decisions regarding the educational services that a child will receive and the location in which services will be provided.

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</span></dd>

	We also understand the commenters' concerns that the requirements in Sec. 300.309(b) may result in untimely evaluations or services and that parents must be fully informed about the school's concerns about their child's progress and interventions provided by the school.  Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We will also add a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to ensure that the parents of a child suspected of having an SLD who has participated in a process that evaluates the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, are notified about the State's policies regarding collection of child performance data and the general education services that will be provided; strategies to increase their child's rate of learning; and their right to request an evaluation at any time.

Discussion:  The process by which LEAs choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC and the assurances that LEAs must provide if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC are determined by each State.  Section 300.210(b)(2), consistent with section 613(a)(6)(B) of the Act, states that, if an LEA chooses not to coordinate with the NIMAC, the LEA must provide an assurance to the SEA that the LEA will provide instructional materials to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.  Therefore, it would be unnecessary and burdensome to require LEAs to provide assurances to the Department or to require LEAs to report to the Department whether they choose to coordinate with the NIMAC.  Each State has its own mechanisms and processes for obtaining assurances from its LEAs, and we believe it would be inappropriate for these regulations to define the process by which LEAs inform the SEA that they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC or to specify the content of the assurances that LEAs must provide to the SEA if they choose not to coordinate with the NIMAC.

With respect to a draft IEP, we encourage public agency staff to come to an IEP Team meeting prepared to discuss evaluation findings and preliminary recommendations.  Likewise, parents have the right to bring questions, concerns, and preliminary recommendations to the IEP Team meeting as part of a full discussion of the child's needs and the services to be provided to meet those needs.  We do not encourage public agencies to prepare a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, particularly if doing so would inhibit a full discussion of the child's needs.  However, if a public agency develops a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, the agency should make it clear to the parents at the outset of the meeting that the services proposed by the agency are preliminary recommendations for review and discussion with the parents.  The public agency also should provide the parents with a copy of its draft proposals, if the agency has developed them, prior to the IEP Team meeting so as to give the parents an opportunity to review the recommendations of the public agency prior to the IEP Team meeting, and be better able to engage in a full discussion of the proposals for the IEP.

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Although the addition of serious bodily injury significantly simplifies the process for removing a child who has engaged in such misconduct, the data suggest that the savings from the final regulations will be minimal.  Recent Department of Justice data show that "fighting without a weapon" is by far the most common type of serious misconduct engaged in by all students.  However, State-reported data suggest that, of the 20,000 instances in 2002-2003 in which children with disabilities were suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days, only 1,200 involved serious bodily injury or removal "by a hearing officer for likely injury."  We estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served during the 2006-2007 school year.  Using these data, we project that there would have been approximately 1,283 instances in 2006-2007 in which a school district might have requested approval from a hearing officer to remove a child for inflicting serious bodily injury, if the law had not been changed.  Taking into account the time that would have been spent by both relevant school administrators and the hearing officers and their estimated hourly wages (about $125 per hour for hearing officers and $50 per hour for school administrators), we conclude that the unilateral authority afforded school officials under the final regulations produce only minimal savings (less than $1 million).</span></dd>

To determine the impact of this change, it is necessary to estimate the savings created by providing fewer notices to parents who are notified about more than one IEP Team meeting during the year or who file more than one request for a due process hearing.  Given the small number of hearing requests in a year (about 20 per 10,000 children with disabilities), our analysis will focus on the number of parents involved in more than one IEP Team meeting.  Although we lack detailed data on the number of IEP Team meetings conducted each year, we estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served in school year 2006-2007.  For the vast majority of these children, we believe there will be only one IEP Team meeting during the year.  For purposes of estimating an upper limit on savings, if we assume an average of 1.2 meetings per year per child, 1.39 million children will have two IEP Team meetings each year and the change reflected in Sec. 300.504(a) will result in 1.39 million fewer procedural notices provided to parents.  While some people may believe this change represents a significant reduction in paperwork for schools, the actual savings are likely to be minimal given the low cost of producing a notice of this size (about 10 pages) and the small amount of administrative staff time involved in providing this notice to parents (about 10 minutes).  Taking all of this into consideration, total savings are unlikely to exceed $5 million.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. 300.156, consistent with section 612(a)(14) of the Act, are sufficient to ensure that paraprofessionals meet high standards and that including additional requirements in these regulations is unnecessary.  These provisions require an SEA to establish and maintain qualifications to ensure that personnel, including paraprofessionals, are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities; and require the qualifications for paraprofessionals to be consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to the professional discipline in which those personnel are providing special education or related services.  In addition, the ESEA requires that paraprofessionals working in a program supported by title I of the ESEA, including special education paraprofessionals who assist in instruction in title I-funded programs, have at least an associate's degree, have completed at least two years of college, or meet a rigorous standard of quality and demonstrate, through a formal State or local assessment, knowledge of, and the ability to assist in instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics, reading readiness, writing readiness, or mathematics readiness, as appropriate.  Paraprofessionals in title I schools do not need to meet these requirements if their role does not involve instructional support, such as special education paraprofessionals who solely provide personal care services.  For more information on the ESEA requirements for paraprofessionals, see 34 CFR 200.58 and section 1119 of the ESEA, and the Department's nonregulatory guidance, Title I Paraprofessionals (March 1, 2004), which can be found on the Department's Web site at:  http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.pdf.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We agree that the rules of construction in both proposed Sec. 300.156(e) and proposed Sec. 300.18(e) must be revised so that both rules are the same.  The changes will clarify that a parent or student may not file a due process complaint on behalf of a student, or file a judicial action on behalf of a class of students for the failure of a particular SEA or LEA employee to be highly qualified; however, a parent may file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA.  In addition to permitting a parent to file a State complaint with the SEA, an organization or an individual may also file a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, consistent with the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153.  We believe that this is appropriate given the wording of section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act "...or to prevent a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the State educational agency" and incorporated in the regulations in Sec. 300.156(e) and new Sec. 300.18(f) (proposed Sec. 300.18(e)).  By incorporating the wording from the construction clause in section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act in the regulations as previously noted, parents and other interested parties, may seek compliance through the State complaint process.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
A State's role in this regard is thus twofold--it must ensure that children with disabilities are included in the assessments and that the accommodations that are offered to individual children with disabilities are ones that allow a child's academic achievement to be measured. This carries with it, we believe, a responsibility for each State to clearly identify for IEP Teams those accommodations that, if used, will not result in an invalid score, so that children with disabilities will be appropriately included in assessments. Therefore, as noted earlier, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(i) to require State and LEA guidelines to identify the accommodations for each assessment that do not result in invalid scores. We also believe that, to meet its responsibility to ensure that children with disabilities are included in assessments, a State needs to instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores. The child's IEP Team, though, remains the primary decisionmaker for the accommodations that will be made available to the child. Therefore, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(ii) to make clear that State and LEA guidelines must instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </span></dd>
