Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118 apply to all children with disabilities, including preschool children who are entitled to FAPE.  Public agencies that do not operate programs for preschool children without disabilities are not required to initiate those programs solely to satisfy the LRE requirements of the Act.  Public agencies that do not have an inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports must explore alternative methods to ensure that the LRE requirements are met.  Examples of such alternative methods might include placement options in private preschool programs or other community-based settings.  Paying for the placement of qualified preschool children with disabilities in a private preschool with children without disabilities is one, but not the only, option available to public agencies to meet the LRE requirements.  We believe the regulations should allow public agencies to choose an appropriate option to meet the LRE requirements.  However, if a public agency determines that placement in a private preschool program is necessary as a means of providing special education and related services to a child with a disability, the program must be at no cost to the parent of the child.</span></dd>

Comment:  One commenter recommended changing Sec. 300.600 to specify that the Department's monitoring of States for compliance with the LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.117 include a review of IEPs to determine if:  (1) placements were based on the individual unique needs of each child; (2) placements were requested by parents; (3) IEP Teams followed the IEP requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.328; (4) children received the services required to participate and progress in the general curriculum; (5) children are in appropriate environments; and (6) the educational and emotional advancements of children were considered.

Discussion:  The phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c) was added to clarify that a parent may send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE mandate.  A parent has always had this option; a parent who chooses this option for the child does not violate the LRE mandate as long as the child is educated with his or her peers without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate.  However, we agree that this phrase is unnecessary, confusing, and may be misunderstood to mean that parents have a right to veto the placement decision made by the group of individuals in Sec. 300.116(a)(1).  We will, therefore, remove the phrase. </span></dd>

That is, each child's educational placement must be determined on an individual case-by-case basis depending on each child's unique educational needs and circumstances, rather than by the child's category of disability, and must be based on the child's IEP.  We believe the LRE provisions are sufficient to ensure that public agencies provide low-incidence children with disabilities access to appropriate educational programming and services in the educational setting appropriate to meet the needs of the child in the LRE.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17 accurately reflects the specific language in section 602(9) of the Act.  We believe it is unnecessary to change the definition of FAPE in the manner recommended by the commenters because providing services in conformity with a child's IEP in the LRE is implicit in the definition of FAPE.  Consistent with Sec. 300.17(b), FAPE means that special education and related services must meet the standards of the SEA and the requirements in Part B of the Act, which include the LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118.  Additionally, Sec. 300.17(d) provides that FAPE means that special education and related services are provided in conformity with an IEP that meets the requirements in section 614(d) of the Act.  Consistent with section 614(d)(1)(i)(V) of the Act, the IEP must include a statement of the extent, if any, to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in the regular education class.  </span></dd>

Comment:  We received a number of comments regarding the phrase, "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c).  As proposed, Sec. 300.116(b)(3) requires the child's placement to be as close as possible to the child's home, "unless the parent agrees otherwise;" and Sec. 300.116(c) requires that, unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement, the child must be educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled, "unless the parent agrees otherwise."  Many commenters requested removing the phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise," because it is not included in section 612(a)(5) of the Act and is not necessary to clarify that a parent may place his or her child in a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE requirements.  Other commenters suggested removing the phrase and clarifying that a decision by the child's parent to send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school is not a violation of the LRE requirements.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

implementation) should not take one year to correct; whereas instances 
of noncompliance related to systemic issues may take longer than one 
year to correct. The commenter also questioned how proposed Sec.

If, however, a third party provider, such as a public benefits or insurance company, is unable to provide funding for services outside a clinical setting or other specific setting, the public agency cannot use the third party provider's inability to provide such funding as an appropriate justification for not providing a child with a disability FAPE in the LRE.

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.
