Discussion:  Interim alternative educational settings under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(g) are limited to not more than 45 school days, unless extended by the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532(b)(3) because returning the child to his or her original placement would be substantially likely to cause injury to him or herself or to others.  The 45-school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting, unless extended by Sec. 300.532(b)(3), is a maximum time limit for a change in placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  We decline to change the regulations as suggested by the commenters based on the school year ending before a child completes the ordered school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting (in this example 45 school days).  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that precludes the public agency from requiring the child to fulfill the remainder of the placement when a new school year begins as agency personnel have this flexibility under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Department has long interpreted the Act to permit schools to remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his or her current placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days, and that additional removals of 10 consecutive school days or less in the same school year would be possible, as long as those removals do not constitute a change in placement.  The requirements in Sec. 300.530(b) do not permit using repeated disciplinary removals of 10 school days or less as a means of avoiding the change in placement options in Sec. 300.536.  We believe it is important for purposes of school safety and order to preserve the authority that school personnel have to be able to remove a child for a discipline infraction for a short period of time, even though the child already may have been removed for more than 10 school days in that school year, as long as the pattern of removals does not itself constitute a change in placement of the child.</span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
While we agree with the commenters that some areas of noncompliance 
are more difficult to correct than others, we do not agree that the 
timeline should be extended beyond one year. Our experience has been 
that most States can correct noncompliance, including noncompliance 
that is spread broadly across a system, in less than one year from 
identification of the noncompliance. For example, States have required 
the implementation of short-term correction strategies while they are 
developing and implementing a plan for long-term change to ensure 
sustained compliance. An example of a short-term correction strategy 
coupled with a longer-term change might include contracting with speech 
therapists to provide the speech pathology services needed by current 
students while developing an in-district program to support speech 
pathology assistants to become certified speech language pathologists. 
Therefore, Sec.  300.600(e) provides an appropriate timeline for 
correcting noncompliance, including systemic and long-standing 
noncompliance. In cases where a State is unable to correct 
noncompliance within one year of identification, as provided in Sec.  
300.600(e), a State may enter into a compliance agreement with the 
Department under section 457 of GEPA (Compliance Agreement), if the 
Department deems a Compliance Agreement appropriate. The purpose of a 
Compliance Agreement is to allow a State the time needed to correct 
long-standing systemic noncompliance and come into full compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the Federal program as soon as feasible, 
but not later than three years from the date of the Compliance 
Agreement. A Compliance Agreement allows a State to continue to receive 
its grant award under Part B of the Act while it works toward achieving 
full compliance under the terms of the agreement. Section 300.600(e), 
when read together with the provisions in section 457 of GEPA, 
adequately address the commenters' concerns.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </span></dd>

	In addition, clarity will be improved by changing certain terms to align with terms that are more commonly used in this part.

In addition, as noted in the discussion of Sec. 300.304(c)(5), we believe that it is important to include language stating that the requirements in Sec. 300.323 are applicable to children with disabilities who have an IEP in effect in a previous public agency and who transfer to a new school within the same "school year," rather than the same "academic year," because "school year" is the term most commonly understood by parents and school officials.

Public agencies will realize savings from the change to the extent that they will not have to continue to contact agencies that declined to participate in IEP Team meetings on transition planning.  In school year 2006-2007, we project that public agencies will conduct 1.193 million meetings for children with disabilities who are 16 through 21 years old.  We used data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) on school contacts of outside agency personnel to project the number of instances in which outside agencies would be invited to IEP Team meetings during the 2006-2007 school year.  Based on these data, we project that schools will invite 1.492 million personnel from other agencies to IEP Team meetings for these students during the 2006-2007 school year.  The NLTS2 also collected data on the percentage of children with a transition plan for whom outside agency staff were actively involved in transition planning.  Based on these data, we project that 432,800 (29 percent) of the contacts will result in the active participation of outside agency personnel in transition planning for children with disabilities who are age 16 through 21.</span></dd>

Comment:  Many comments were received regarding when the procedural safeguards notice must be provided to parents.  One commenter stated that these requirements add paperwork and procedural burdens.  Several commenters expressed concern that parents will have knowledge of their procedural safeguards only when they file a State complaint or request a due process hearing.  Some commenters recommended deleting the requirement in Sec. 300.504(a)(2) for the public agency to give parents the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint or due process hearing in the school year.  Other commenters suggested amending Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to require that the procedural safeguards notice be provided to parents upon receipt of the first due process complaint in that school year.  Some commenters asked whether parents would receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice only upon the first filing of a State complaint or a due process complaint, but not twice, if a parent submits a complaint and also a request for a due process hearing in the same school year.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
When changes to a child's IEP are needed after the annual IEP Team meeting for the school year has been held, Sec. 300.324(a)(4) allows the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency to agree to forego a meeting and develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  Under the previous regulations, the IEP Team was required to reconvene in order to make amendments to an IEP.  Based on our estimate of an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings per child per year, approximately 1.4 million IEP Team meetings beyond the required annual IEP Team meeting would be held during the 2006-2007 school year.  If half of these meetings concerned amendments or modifications to an IEP and parents and agency representatives agreed to forego a meeting and develop a written document in half of these cases, then 350,000 IEP Team meetings would not be needed.  The combined opportunity costs for personnel participating in a typical IEP Team meeting are estimated at $307.  If drafting a written document to amend or modify an IEP is assumed to cost half as much as a meeting, then this change could result in savings of $53.7 million.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
To determine the impact of this change, it is necessary to estimate the savings created by providing fewer notices to parents who are notified about more than one IEP Team meeting during the year or who file more than one request for a due process hearing.  Given the small number of hearing requests in a year (about 20 per 10,000 children with disabilities), our analysis will focus on the number of parents involved in more than one IEP Team meeting.  Although we lack detailed data on the number of IEP Team meetings conducted each year, we estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served in school year 2006-2007.  For the vast majority of these children, we believe there will be only one IEP Team meeting during the year.  For purposes of estimating an upper limit on savings, if we assume an average of 1.2 meetings per year per child, 1.39 million children will have two IEP Team meetings each year and the change reflected in Sec. 300.504(a) will result in 1.39 million fewer procedural notices provided to parents.  While some people may believe this change represents a significant reduction in paperwork for schools, the actual savings are likely to be minimal given the low cost of producing a notice of this size (about 10 pages) and the small amount of administrative staff time involved in providing this notice to parents (about 10 minutes).  Taking all of this into consideration, total savings are unlikely to exceed $5 million.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We are not removing "consecutive" from Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536, as recommended by the commenters, because the Department has long interpreted the Act to permit children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct to be removed from their current educational placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days at a time, and that additional removals of 10 consecutive school days or less in the same school year would be possible, as long as any removal does not constitute a change in placement.  We do not believe the changes to section 615(k) of the Act justify any change in this position.  Further, the Department's position is consistent with S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 43, which states that "a school may order a change in placement for a child who violates a code of student conduct to an appropriate interim educational setting, another setting, or suspension, for 10 consecutive school days or less, to the same extent that it would apply such a discipline measure to a child without a disability."</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

However, Sec. 300.530(d) is clear that the child who is removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive educational services, to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in his or her IEP.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.  The Act is clear that the public agency must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Newly-hired teachers in these covered LEAs have three years from the date of hire to become highly qualified in each core academic subject that they teach.

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended removing the reference to manifestation determination in proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii)).  Several of these commenters stated that it is unnecessary since the manifestation determination is reserved for removals longer than 10 school days.  Some commenters stated if the language in proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that a series of removals constitutes a pattern because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year is going to be retained, proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) should be eliminated because it is excessive and has no basis in the Act.  Other commenters found the manifestation determination requirement in proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section "circular" because requiring a child's behavior to be a manifestation of his or her disability before determining that a change in placement has occurred under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) and then requiring that a manifestation determination be conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), whenever a child's removal constitutes a change in placement, is redundant and confusing. </span></dd>

Because evaluation findings may be used to support requests for due process hearings, we can use data on the number of requests for due process hearings to estimate the number of cases in which more than one evaluation in a single year would have been conducted because parents were not satisfied with the evaluation findings or methodology.  Based on data from the recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, "Special Education:  Numbers of Formal Disputes Are Generally Low and States Are Using Mediation and Other Strategies to Resolve Conflicts" (GAO-03-897), in which States reported receiving 11,068 requests for due process hearings during 1999-2000, we estimate that States would receive 20 requests for every 10,000 students with disabilities during the 2006-2007 school year.  Based on the prevalence of complaints by parents, we estimate that, of the 1.7 million children estimated to be eligible for reevaluation in 2006-2007, multiple evaluations would have been requested by parents for an estimated 3,400 children.  If we assume that these additional evaluations would cost about $1,000 each, public agencies could save $3.4 million under the final regulations by not agreeing to more than one evaluation of children in these instances.  </span></dd>

We have minimal data on the number of manifestation determination reviews being conducted.  However, State-reported data for the 2002-2003 school year suggest that schools are conducting a relatively small number of manifestation reviews.  According to these data, for every 1,000 children with disabilities, approximately 11 will be suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days during the school year (either through a single suspension or as a result of multiple short-term suspensions)--the disciplinary action triggering a manifestation review.  (Please note that we have no way of accurately estimating what portion of short-term suspensions that add up to 10 days would be determined by school personnel to constitute a change in placement.  Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this analysis, that 100 percent of these instances would require a manifestation review because they would be deemed a change in placement).  Based on a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we assume that under previous law at least 85 percent of manifestation reviews resulted in disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspensions or expulsion).  In other words, approximately 15 percent of all manifestation reviews did not result in disciplinary action because the behavior in question was determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Although the addition of serious bodily injury significantly simplifies the process for removing a child who has engaged in such misconduct, the data suggest that the savings from the final regulations will be minimal.  Recent Department of Justice data show that "fighting without a weapon" is by far the most common type of serious misconduct engaged in by all students.  However, State-reported data suggest that, of the 20,000 instances in 2002-2003 in which children with disabilities were suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days, only 1,200 involved serious bodily injury or removal "by a hearing officer for likely injury."  We estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served during the 2006-2007 school year.  Using these data, we project that there would have been approximately 1,283 instances in 2006-2007 in which a school district might have requested approval from a hearing officer to remove a child for inflicting serious bodily injury, if the law had not been changed.  Taking into account the time that would have been spent by both relevant school administrators and the hearing officers and their estimated hourly wages (about $125 per hour for hearing officers and $50 per hour for school administrators), we conclude that the unilateral authority afforded school officials under the final regulations produce only minimal savings (less than $1 million).</span></dd>

States that change their eligibility criteria for SLD may want to carefully consider the reevaluation of children found eligible for special education services using prior procedures.  States should consider the effect of exiting a child from special education who has received special education and related services for many years and how the removal of such supports will affect the child's educational progress, particularly for a child who is in the final year(s) of high school.  Obviously, the group should consider whether the child's instruction and overall special education program have been appropriate as part of this process.  If the special education instruction has been appropriate and the child has not been able to exit special education, this would be strong evidence that the child's eligibility needs to be maintained.</span></dd>

According to State-reported data collected by the Department's Office of Special Education Programs, certification or licensure requirements have been waived for eight percent of special education teachers, or approximately 30,000 teachers.  If States and districts respond to the statutory change reflected in the final regulations by hiring certified teachers to fill these positions, it could cost well over $1 billion to cover the salaries for a single year. (Occupational Employment and Wages Survey, November 2004, indicates a median national salary of $44,330 for elementary school teachers and $46,300 for secondary school teachers.)  However, given that the Study of Personnel Needs in Special Education (SPENSE) found that in 1999-2000, 12,241 positions for special education teachers were left vacant or filled by substitute teachers because suitable candidates could not be found, it is unlikely that States and districts can meet this requirement through hiring.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.504(a), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, requires a public agency to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice at least one time in a school year and under the exceptional circumstances specified in Sec. 300.504(a), which includes the first occurrence of the filing of a due process complaint in a school year.  The procedural safeguards notice, which must be written in language understandable to the general public and in the native language of the parent, unless clearly not feasible to do so, must include a full explanation of the Act's procedural safeguards.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, Sec. 300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means for the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.  Under Sec. 300.504(c)(5)(ii), the notice must inform parents about the opportunity to present and resolve a due process complaint in accordance with the resolution process required in Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, including a party's right to void the resolution agreement within three business days of execution.

We believe it is sufficient for the public agency to conclude that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of removals that total more than 10 school days in a school year, the behaviors are substantially similar in nature, and such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another support the premise that the series of removals constitute a pattern.

Comment: A few commenters requested that the Department clarify 
that the right of a parent to revoke consent for special education and 
related services does not relieve the LEA of its obligation under child 
find to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, 
including children whose parents revoke consent for special education 
and related services. Other commenters requested clarification as to 
the time frame that applies for an LEA to comply with the child find 
and service obligations for a child who exits special education without 
the agreement of the IEP Team and whether the child should be referred 
for services each school year. One commenter expressed concern that 
allowing revocation of parental consent would potentially create a 
disincentive for general educators to refer students to special 
education because teachers would be reluctant to repeatedly refer a 
student for special education if a parent previously revoked consent 
for services.

Comment:  One commenter stated that the requirement in Sec. 300.530(h), which requires the LEA to provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504 whenever the decision to take disciplinary action is made, is inconsistent with the Act and recommended revising Sec. 300.530(h) to be consistent with section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act.  The commenter stated that section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act requires the LEA to "notify" the parents of the decision to take disciplinary action and of all the procedural safeguards.  The commenter stated that the statutory language implies that the LEA simply needs to remind (notify) the parent of the procedural safeguards given to them for the school year as required in section 615(d)(1)(A)(i) through (iii) of the Act, not to "provide" the parents with the procedural safeguards notice as required in Sec. 300.530(h).  </span></dd>

We understand the commenter's concern that this change in the 
regulations may require States to revise their procedures for 
distributing Part B funds, and that there may be some administrative 
burden associated with these changes. However, the importance of 
ensuring consistency across States concerning the distribution of 
section 611 and section 619 funds outweighs the potential 
administrative burden. As previously stated in this preamble, making 
these funds available to LEAs is critical to ensure that each LEA is 
able to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act. We agree with 
commenters that some States have been successful in ensuring small LEAs 
receive allocations when they enroll students with disabilities after 
the school year has begun. However, given that the Act and the 
implementing regulations are silent on whether an SEA must make a 
subgrant to an LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, 
clarification is necessary in Sec. Sec.  300.705(a) and 300.815 to 
remove any ambiguity in this regard. Revising the regulations, rather 
than remaining silent on the issue or issuing guidance, will ensure 
that all States treat LEAs in the same manner, including those LEAs 
that are not serving any children with disabilities, when allocating 
Part B funds.

Discussion: Section 300.815, consistent with section 619(g) of the 
Act, requires that each State provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that are 
responsible for providing education to children aged three through five 
years and have established their eligibility under section 613 of the 
Act. Section 613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for 
assistance under Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits 
a plan that provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of 
the conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving preschool 
children with disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. 
Requiring States to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs responsible 
for providing education to preschool children, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will help ensure that LEAs have Part B 
funds available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or 
to serve preschool children with disabilities who subsequently enroll 
or are identified during the school year. As in the past, LEAs may use 
section 619 funds for direct services to preschool children with 
disabilities or for other permissible activities, such as child find 
and professional development.

Section 1111(h)(6) of the ESEA requires LEAs to inform parents about the professional qualifications of their children's classroom teachers.

In addition, each title I school must provide each parent timely notice that the parent's child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who is not highly qualified.

Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  School health services was retained in the definition of related services in Sec. 300.34(a).  However, the definition of school health services was inadvertently removed in the NPRM.  To correct this error, we will add school health services to the definition of school nurse services and clarify that school health services and school nurse services means health services that are designed to enable a child with a disability to receive FAPE.  We will also add language to clarify that school nurse services are provided by a qualified school nurse and that school health services are provided by either a qualified school nurse or other qualified person.  We recognize that most schools do not have a qualified school nurse on a full-time basis (i.e., a nurse that meets the State standards for a qualified school nurse), and that many schools rely on other qualified school personnel to provide school health services under the direction of a school nurse.  Therefore, we believe it is important to retain the definition of school health services and school nurse services in these regulations.</span></dd>

Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive 
special education and related services, the child is considered a 
general education student and will be considered a general education 
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after 
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State 
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general 
education student who has exited special education for accountability 
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to 
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores 
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the 
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the 
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for 
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a 
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related 
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating 
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the 
State may continue to include the child in the students with 
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two 
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no 
longer be required under the IDEA to provide accommodations that were 
previously included in the child's IEP.

Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires an SEA to develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a State plan for a high cost fund.  Under Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i)(A), the State plan must, among other components, establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives from LEAs, a definition of a high need child with a disability that meets certain criteria.  This plan must be developed no later than 90 days after the State reserves funds for a high cost fund.  Section 300.704(c)(3)(ii), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, requires a State to make its final State plan for the high cost fund available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year, including dissemination of such information on the State's Web site.  Although there is nothing in the Act that requires that the public be given the opportunity to comment on the State's plan, there also is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a State from providing an opportunity for public comment prior to finalizing the State's plan for the high cost fund.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Published estimates of the cost of multidisciplinary evaluations range from $500 to $2,500, but these estimates may overestimate potential savings because testing is a significant factor in the cost of evaluations, and districts are already permitted to dispense with additional testing when extant data are sufficient for reevaluation.  The extent to which States and districts eliminated unnecessary testing during triennial evaluations under the previous regulations is unclear, but program officers estimate that additional testing or observation by a school psychologist is not needed for as many as half of the approximately 1.7 million children eligible for triennial evaluations each year.  In the estimated 850,000 cases in which additional testing is not needed, review of the extant data may still be warranted to determine if a child still needs special education and related services under the Act or to assess whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services being provided are needed to help the child meet the child's IEP goals.  Even if additions or modifications to special education and related services are not likely, parents may not want to dispense with the triennial evaluation if they believe further information could be gained from the extant data or they want to compare their child's progress against his or her previous assessments.  If parents and the district agree that a reevaluation is not needed in 15 percent, or 127,500, of these cases and a reevaluation using only extant data would have cost $150, the final regulations could save $19.125 million. </span></dd>

Comment: A few commenters acknowledged that there are some areas of 
noncompliance that can be corrected within one year of identification; 
however, the commenters expressed concern that the one-year timeline is 
not realistic for findings of systemic noncompliance in substantive 
areas such as the provision of FAPE, placement in the least restrictive 
environment (LRE), and child find. Other commenters requested that 
proposed Sec.  300.600(e) be revised to reflect ``degrees'' of 
noncompliance. For example, one commenter suggested that some instances 
of noncompliance (e.g., those related to a specific child's IEP 
implementation) should not take one year to correct; whereas instances 
of noncompliance related to systemic issues may take longer than one 
year to correct. The commenter also questioned how proposed Sec.  
300.600(e) will address situations involving longstanding 
noncompliance. Lastly, one commenter agreed with the intent of proposed 
Sec.  300.600(e) but requested that the timeline be modified to allow 
for exceptions, such as allowing a State to initiate appropriate action 
to correct noncompliance within one year of identification or as soon 
as possible thereafter.

By contrast, once parents opt out of the public school system, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children.  In such cases, it would be overly intrusive for the school district to insist on an evaluation over a parent's objection.

Discussion:  It is not necessary to add language clarifying that waiving three-year reevaluations must not be a routine agency policy or practice because the regulations are clear that this is a decision that is made individually for each child by the parent of the child and the public agency.  Section 300.303(b)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, states that a reevaluation must occur at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  When a parent and a public agency agree that a three-year reevaluation is unnecessary, there is no requirement that the public agency offer the parent a reevaluation each year.  We do not believe that it is necessary to have such a requirement because if parents who have waived a three year reevaluation later decide to request an evaluation, they can do so.  Also, public agencies have a continuing responsibility to request parental consent for a reevaluation if they determine that the child's educational or related services needs warrant a reevaluation.</span></dd>

We decline to amend the regulations to distinguish between or 
stratify types of noncompliance. Any noncompliance with the provisions 
in 34 CFR Part 300 is subject to the provisions in Sec.  300.600(e), 
and, therefore, must be corrected as soon as possible, and in no case 
later than one year from identification. However, we do agree with the 
commenter who suggested that some instances of noncompliance, e.g., 
those related to child-specific IEP timelines, may be corrected far 
more quickly than one year from identification. We expect that all 
noncompliance in those instances will be corrected as soon as possible. 
We recognize, though, that not all noncompliance can be corrected 
immediately. In our more than 30 year experience in implementing Part B 
of the Act, we have found that one year is a reasonable outside time 
limit for States for correcting noncompliance.

Discussion:  Through its review of charter schools' access to Federal funding, it has come to the Department's attention that additional guidance is needed regarding whether charter schools that are established as their own LEAs must be nonprofit entities in order to meet the definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28.  The definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28(b)(2) specifically includes a public charter school that is established as an LEA under State law and that exercises administrative control or direction of, or performs a service function for, itself.  For purposes of the Act, the definitions of charter school, elementary school, and secondary school in Sec. Sec. 300.7, 300.13, and 300.36, respectively, require that a public elementary or secondary charter school be a nonprofit entity.  Therefore, a public elementary or secondary charter school established as its own LEA under State law, also must be a nonprofit entity.  Although these regulations do not specifically define nonprofit, the definition in 34 CFR Sec. 77.1 applies to these regulations.  In order to eliminate any confusion on this issue, we will revise the definition of LEA to reflect that a public elementary or secondary charter school that is established as its own LEA under State law must be a nonprofit entity.  </span></dd>

Indicator 15 in the SPP measures the effectiveness of a State's 
general supervision by determining the percentage of noncompliance that 
was corrected within one year of identification. It is the Department's 
longstanding position, as reflected in Indicator 15 of the SPP, that 
when a State identifies noncompliance with the requirements of Part B 
of the Act by its LEAs, the noncompliance must be corrected as soon as 
possible, and in no case later than one year after the State identifies 
the noncompliance. The Department has established a target of 100 
percent for Indicator 15, meaning States are expected to correct 100 
percent of noncompliance as soon as possible, and in no case later than 
one year. Further, in our experience, when a State makes a good faith 
effort to correct noncompliance, the needed corrective actions can be 
accomplished and their effectiveness verified within one year. Finally, 
we expect that in the limited circumstances where correction does not 
occur within one year of the State's identification, the State will 
take specific enforcement actions with the LEA that are designed to 
achieve compliance. Section 300.600(e) is consistent with the 
Department's policy and guidance concerning the State's monitoring and 
enforcement responsibilities under Part B of the Act and the reporting 
requirements for Indicator 15.

Discussion:  We believe a one-year timeline is reasonable, and will assist in smooth implementation of the State complaint procedures.  The references to longer periods for continuing violations and for compensatory services claims in current Sec. 300.662(c) were removed to ensure expedited resolution for public agencies and children with disabilities.  Limiting a complaint to a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date that the complaint is received will help ensure that problems are raised and addressed promptly so that children receive FAPE.  We believe longer time limits are not generally effective and beneficial to the child because the issues in a State complaint become so stale that they are unlikely to be resolved.  However, States may choose to accept and resolve complaints regarding alleged violations that occurred outside the one-year timeline, just as they are free to add additional protections in other areas that are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is necessary to retain the language in current Sec. 300.662(c).</span></dd>

Congress' intent in adding this requirement was to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior distributes funds under Part B of the Act quickly and efficiently to BIA-funded schools to ensure that they have the resources they need to provide services to children with disabilities.

strict one-year timeline may impede the SEA's ability to use the most

The final regulations will not significantly affect the number of evaluations in the latter two instances because public agencies and parents are likely to agree that multiple evaluations are warranted.

Sections 300.530(g) through 300.532 incorporate two significant statutory changes relating to the authority of school personnel to remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings.  First, the Act now gives school personnel the authority to remove to interim alternative educational settings children who have inflicted serious bodily injury to themselves, or others.  Under previous law, school personnel were authorized to remove children to alternative settings only for misconduct involving: 1) the use and possession of weapons; and 2) the knowing possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The Act added the commission of serious bodily injury to this list.  In cases involving serious bodily injury, school personnel would be able to unilaterally remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings for up to 45 school days without having to request that a hearing officer review the facts to determine whether or not the child is substantially likely to harm him or herself or others.  Second, the 45-day rule has changed.  Under previous law, students could not be removed to interim alternative educational settings for more than 45 days.

	Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, in consultation with private school officials and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, also is responsible for determining and paying for the services to be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  We believe this responsibility extends to children from other States who are enrolled in a private school located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act clarifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for spending a proportionate amount of its Federal Part B funds on special education and related services for children enrolled by their parents in the private schools located in the LEA.  The Act does not provide an exception for out-of-State children with disabilities attending a private school located in the LEA and, therefore, out-of-State children with disabilities must be included in the group of parentally-placed children with disabilities whose needs are considered in determining which parentally-placed private school children with disabilities will be served and the types and amounts of services to be provided.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act does not require that children with disabilities suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons continue to be educated with children who are not disabled during the period of their removal.

Sections 300.530 through 300.536 address the options available to school authorities in disciplining children with disabilities and set forth procedures that must be followed when taking disciplinary actions and in making decisions regarding the educational services that a child will receive and the location in which services will be provided.

Comment:  One commenter requested revising the regulations to eliminate financial incentives for parents to refer children for special education and then unilaterally placing their child in private schools without first receiving special education and related services from the school district.

Discussion:  The definition of services plan was included to describe the content, development, and implementation of plans for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities who have been designated to receive equitable services.  The definition cross-references the specific requirements for the provision of services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in Sec. 300.132 and Sec. Sec. 300.137 through 300.139, which provide that parentally-placed private school children have no individual right to special education and related services and thus are not entitled to FAPE.

Consistent with this position and in light of comments received regarding the requirements for private school teachers providing equitable services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under Sec. 300.138, we will add language to new Sec. 300.18(h) (proposed Sec. 300.18(g)) to clarify that the highly qualified special education teacher requirements also do not apply to private school teachers who provide equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under Sec. 300.138.</span></dd>

However, the commenter's request regarding BIA schools is inconsistent with the Act.

	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.  In addition, children who do not receive appropriate educational services may develop behavioral problems that have a negative impact on the learning environment for other children.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The determination of which teacher school personnel should consult should be based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the needs of the child and the expertise of the child's teachers.  We agree that, in many cases, the special education teacher may be the most appropriate teacher with whom school personnel should consult.  This, however, is not always the case.  In light of the short-term nature of the removals under paragraph (d)(4) of the section and the need for school personnel to make quick decisions regarding services, we believe local school personnel need broad flexibility in making such decisions and are in the best position to determine the appropriate teacher with whom to consult.  For these reasons, we are not amending Sec. 300.530(d)(4) to require consultation with the child's special education teacher as in current Sec. 300.121(d)(3)(i).

Discussion:  Section 300.530(g)(3) incorporates the new provision in section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act that permits school personnel to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days without regard to whether the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability if the child has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school, on school premises, or at a school function.  Section 615(k)(7)(D) of the Act is clear that the term serious bodily injury has the meaning given the term in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  That provision defines serious bodily injury as bodily injury, which involves substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Nothing in the Act permits the Department to expand the definition of serious bodily injury, as used in Sec. 300.530(g), to include a bodily injury beyond that included in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h).

Discussion:  Services offered to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may be provided on-site at a child's private school, including a religious school, to the extent consistent with law, or at another location.  The Department believes, in the interests of the child, LEAs should provide services on site at the child's private school so as not to unduly disrupt the child's educational experience, unless there is a compelling rationale for these services to be provided off-site.  The phrase "to the extent consistent with law" is in section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act.  We interpret this language to mean that the provision of services on the premises of a private school takes place in a manner that would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would not be inconsistent with applicable State constitutions or law.

Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, the obligation to conduct child find and provide equitable services extends to children who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This obligation also applies to children who have been enrolled by their parents in private facilities if those facilities are elementary schools or secondary schools, as defined in subpart A of the regulations.  Because facilities that meet the definition of elementary school or secondary school are covered under this section, we believe it is important to retain the reference to facilities in these regulations.  We will, however, revise Sec. 300.130 to clarify that children with disabilities who are enrolled by their parents in facilities that meet the definition of elementary school in Sec. 300.13 or secondary school in new Sec. 300.36 (proposed Sec. 300.35) would be considered parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. </span></dd>

The obligation to conduct child find for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, is independent of the services provision.  Further, Sec. 300.131(d), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IV) of the Act, clarifies that the costs of child find activities for parentally-placed private school children, including individual evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether the LEA has spent an appropriate amount on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for States or LEAs that spend State or local funds to provide special education or related services beyond those required under Part B of the Act.  The Secretary, therefore, cannot consider alternative compliance with the parentally-placed private school provisions in the Act and these regulations or consider States and LEAs that use State and local funds to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond the required proportionate share of Federal Part B funds, including providing FAPE to such children, to have met the statutory and regulatory requirements governing parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.

For purposes of this analysis as it relates to small entities, the Secretary has focused on LEAs because these regulations most directly affect local public agencies.  The analysis uses a definition of small school district developed by the NCES for purposes of its recent publication, Characteristics of Small and Rural School Districts.  In that publication, NCES defines a small school district as "one having fewer students in membership than the sum of (a) 25 students per grade in the elementary grades it offers (usually K-8) and (b) 100 students per grade in the secondary grades it offers (usually 9-12)".  Using this definition, approximately 38 percent of the Nation's public agencies in the 2002-2003 Common Core of Data were considered small and served three percent of the Nation's students.  Approximately 17 percent of children in small districts had IEPs.</span></dd>

With regard to the comment opposing the use of public school funds for the education of publicly-placed private school children by teachers who do not meet the highly qualified teacher requirements, a State or public agency may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private sources of support that are available in the State to meet the requirements of the Act.

Discussion:  The Act does not address situations where a private school straddles more than one LEA.  However, the Act does specify that the LEA in which the private school is located is responsible for providing special education to children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents, consistent with the number of such children and their needs.  In situations where more than one LEA potentially could assume the responsibility of providing equitable services, the SEA, consistent with its general supervisory responsibility, determines which LEA in the State is responsible for ensuring the equitable participation of children with disabilities attending that private school.  We do not believe that the situation is common enough to warrant a change in the regulations.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department believes it would not be appropriate to include the requested language in this section because services in these circumstances are provided under somewhat different criteria than is normally the case.  Section 300.530 clarifies the procedures school personnel must follow when removing a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from their current placement (e.g., suspension and expulsion).  This includes how decisions are made regarding the educational services the child receives and the location in which they will be provided.  School officials need some reasonable amount of flexibility in providing services to children with disabilities who have violated school conduct rules, and should not necessarily have to provide exactly the same services, in the same settings, to these children.  Therefore, we decline to regulate further in this regard.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.707(b), consistent with section 611(h)(1)(A) of the Act, sets specific dates for the Secretary of the Interior to allocate funds provided to the Secretary of the Interior under the Act to elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  The Secretary of the Interior must allocate 80 percent of these funds by July 1 of each fiscal year, and the remaining 20 percent by September 30 of each fiscal year.  The Act does not require the Secretary of Education to meet any deadline for providing and distributing funds to the Secretary of the Interior.  Provision of funds under Part B of the Act to the Department of the Interior (DOI) will always depend on whether the DOI has properly established and maintained its eligibility.

Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.  The intent of Congress in revising section 615(k)(5) of the Act was to "ensure that schools can appropriately discipline students, while maintaining protections for students whom the school had valid reason to know had a disability" and that the provisions in the Act should not have the "unintended consequence of providing a shield against the ability of a school district to be able to appropriately discipline a student."  (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 46).  We are not including time restrictions, as suggested by the commenters, to the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section because we believe such restrictions are unnecessary and could have the unintended consequence of hindering the school's ability to appropriately discipline a child.  We believe the basis of knowledge provision in Sec. 300.534(b) is sufficient to ensure that a school had valid reason to know that a child may need special education and related services.</span></dd>

	We also believe it is important to be clear about the confidentiality requirements for children who are placed in private schools by their parents, given the significant change in the child find requirements for these children.  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, child find for these children now is the responsibility of the LEA in which the private school is located and not the child's LEA of residence.  We can anticipate situations in which there may be requests for information to be exchanged between the two LEAs, such as when a child is evaluated and identified as a child with a disability by the LEA in which the private school is located and the child subsequently returns to public school in the LEA of residence.  We believe under such circumstances parental consent should be required before personally identifiable information is released between officials of the LEA where a private school is located and the LEA of the parent's residence.  We believe that consent is important in these situations to protect the privacy of the child and the child's family.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(3) to Sec. 300.622 to make this clear.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that transportation services should be removed from Sec. 300.139(b).  If services are offered at a site separate from the child's private school, transportation may be necessary to get the child to and from that other site.  Failure to provide transportation could effectively deny the child an opportunity to benefit from the services that the LEA has determined through consultation to offer its parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In this situation, although transportation is not a related service, as defined in Sec. 300.34, transportation is necessary to enable the child to participate and to make the offered services accessible to the child.  LEAs should work in consultation with representatives of private school children to ensure that services are provided at sites, including on the premises of the child's private school, so that LEAs do not incur significant transportation costs.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(vi)(I) of the Act, equitable services must be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by the public agency with an individual, association, agency, organization, or other entity.  Section 300.142(a) provides that an LEA may use Part B funds to make public school personnel available in other than public facilities to the extent necessary to provide equitable services for parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools and if those services are not otherwise provided by the private school to children as a benefit provided to all children attending that school.  Under Sec. 300.142(b), an LEA may use Part B funds to pay for the services of an employee of a private school to provide equitable services if the employee performs the services outside of his or her regular hours of duty and the employee performs the services under public supervision and control.

Discussion:  Section 300.131, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools in which the child is enrolled are located, not the LEA where the child resides, is responsible for conducting child find, including an individual evaluation for a child with a disability enrolled by the child's parent in a private elementary school or secondary school located in the LEA.  The Act specifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting both the child find process and the initial evaluation.  Therefore, the LEA where private schools are located may not seek reimbursement from the LEA of residence for the cost of conducting the evaluation or to request that the LEA of residence conduct the evaluation.  However, the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located has options as to how it meets its responsibilities.

Elementary- level teachers may demonstrate subject matter expertise by passing a rigorous State test of their subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum, but middle or secondary school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competence in each of the academic subjects that they teach.  </span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a 
child in a private school when FAPE is at issue does not constitute a 
revocation of consent under Sec.  300.300(b). However, the provisions 
concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by 
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.  
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when 
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a 
disagreement between the parent and public agency about the provision 
of FAPE, do not constitute parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services.

Discussion:  The exception referred to by the commenters is already in the regulations.  Section 300.301(d)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers to a new school before an evaluation is completed, if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  While the exception to the 60-day timeframe, as stated in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, only applies when a child transfers to a school located in another public agency, we do not believe the language in paragraph (d)(2), as proposed in the NPRM, is necessarily clear on this matter.  We, therefore, have added language in paragraph (d)(2) to provide additional clarity.  We believe it is important that it is understood that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency.  When a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency, we expect that an initial evaluation will be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the State-established timeframe.  </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We believe that the regulations do not need to be amended to clarify "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" because what constitutes "unique circumstances" is best determined at the local level by school personnel who know the individual child and all the facts and circumstances regarding a child's behavior.  We believe it would impede efforts of school personnel responsible for making a determination as to whether a change in placement for disciplinary purposes is appropriate for a child if the Department attempted to restrict or limit the interpretation of "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case-basis."  Factors such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the violation of a school code could be unique circumstances considered by school personnel when determining whether a disciplinary change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability.  We believe providing school personnel the flexibility to consider whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability on a case-by-case basis and to determine what unique circumstances should be considered regarding a child who violates a code of conduct, as provided for under section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, will limit the inappropriate removal of a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  We also decline the commenters' suggestion to regulate further about the case-by-case determination in light of the discretion granted under the Act to school personnel in making this determination.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.  We will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a cochlear implant is an example of device optimization and is not a related service under the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.

We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.

For example, if another State agency provides school health services under the Act, consent would not be required for a school nurse to have access to personally identifiable information in a child's education records in order to provide the school health services that are included on the child's IEP. </span></dd>

	We do not agree with the premise of the commenters that not requiring private school teachers who provide services to publicly-placed children with disabilities to meet the highly qualified teacher requirements means that the education provided to these children in the private school setting does not meet the standards that apply to children with disabilities served by the public agency.  States have flexibility in developing standards that meet the requirements of the Act.  The standards that SEAs apply to private schools that contract with public agencies to provide FAPE to children with disabilities, are, so long as they meet the requirements of Part B of the Act and its regulations, a State matter.

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.300(e)(4) clarifies that parents who enroll their children in private elementary schools and secondary schools have the option of not participating in an LEA's child find activities required under Sec. 300.131.  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart D, once parents opt out of the public schools, States and school districts do not have the same interest in requiring parents to agree to the evaluation of their children as they do for children enrolled in public schools, in light of the public agencies' obligation to educate public school children with disabilities.  We further indicate in the discussion of subpart D that we have added new Sec. 300.300(e)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.300(d)) to clarify that if the parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the child's parent at the parent's own expense does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or reevaluation, the public agency may not use the due process procedures in section 615 of the Act and the public agency is not required to consider the child for equitable services.  </span></dd>

The provisions in the Act and the regulations apply to the responsibilities of the SEA and its LEAs and not to private schools or entities.  Because the requirements of the Act do not apply to private schools, we do not believe requiring SEAs to permit an LEA to submit a complaint to the SEA alleging that representatives of the private schools did not consult in a meaningful way with the LEA would serve a meaningful purpose.  The equitable services made available under Part B of the Act are a benefit to the parentally-placed private school children and not services provided to the private schools.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to clarify in the regulations that the IEP can serve as the services plan because, as stated elsewhere in this preamble, a services plan should only describe the specific special education and related services offered to a parentally-placed private school child with a disability designated to receive services.  We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.  There is nothing, however, in these regulations that would prevent a State that provides more services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities than they are required to do under the Act to use an IEP in place of a services plan, consistent with State law.  </span></dd>

However, we have reviewed the regulations and believe that it is important for these regulations to define "regular diploma" consistent with the ESEA regulations in 34 CFR Sec. 200.19(a)(1)(i).

	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.148(b) that a parental placement does not need to meet State standards in order to be "appropriate" under the Act is retained from current Sec. 300.402(c) to be consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985) (Burlington) and Florence County School District Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (Carter).  Under the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, a court may order reimbursement for a parent who unilaterally withdraws his or her child from a public school that provides an inappropriate education under the Act and enrolls the child in a private school that provides an education that is otherwise proper under the Act, but does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.  The Court noted that these standards apply only to public agencies' own programs for educating children with disabilities and to public agency placements of children with disabilities in private schools for the purpose of providing a program of special education and related services.  The Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Burlington that tuition reimbursement is only available if a Federal court concludes "both that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school placement was proper under the Act."  (510 U.S. at 12).  We believe LEAs can avoid reimbursement awards by offering and providing FAPE consistent with the Act either in public schools or in private schools in which the parent places the child.  However, a decision as to whether an LEA's offer or provision of FAPE was proper under the Act and any decision regarding reimbursement must be made by a court or hearing officer.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in these regulations a provision relieving a public agency of its obligation to provide tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement in a private school if the child did not first receive special education and related services from the LEA.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</span></dd>

The Secretary concludes that the final regulations will generate some minimal savings from the reduction in time required to conduct the manifestation reviews.  Schools would also realize some qualitative benefits related to the increased likelihood that the outcome of the review will result in disciplinary action, thereby fostering a school environment that is safer, more orderly, and more conducive to learning.  The Secretary acknowledges that the final regulations could create additional costs for parents of children who, but for this change, would not have been subject to disciplinary removals, to the extent that such parents disagree with the manifestation determination and choose to appeal it.

The public agency must make FAPE available until age 21 or the age limit established by State law, even though the child would not be included as graduating for AYP purposes under the ESEA.

Discussion: Section 300.705(a), consistent with section 611(f)(1) 
of the Act, requires each State to provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that have 
established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Section 
613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for assistance under 
Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits a plan that 
provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of the 
conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving children with 
disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. Requiring States 
to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will ensure that LEAs have Part B funds 
available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or to 
serve children with disabilities who subsequently enroll or are 
identified during the year. Regardless of the level of funding made 
available for the Part B program under the Act, neither the Act nor the 
implementing regulations require that Part B funds be spent only for 
direct services for students who are currently eligible for special 
education and related services. As in the past, LEAs may use Part B 
funds for direct services to children with disabilities or for other 
permissible activities, such as child find, professional development, 
and more recently, for coordinated early intervening services in 
accordance with Sec.  300.226.

Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.  However, there is nothing in these regulations that would prohibit school personnel, if they choose to do so, from including parents in the consultation.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</span></dd>

Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.

Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</span></dd>

Discussion:  There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the requirements for reevaluations in Sec. 300.303 diminish the rights of parents.  As stated in Sec. 300.303, consistent with section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a parent can request a reevaluation at any time, and can agree with the public agency to conduct a reevaluation more frequently than once a year.  Likewise, a parent and a public agency can agree that a reevaluation is not necessary.  We believe that in reaching an agreement that a reevaluation is unnecessary, as provided for in Sec. 300.303(b), the parent and public agency will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of conducting a reevaluation, as well as what effect a reevaluation might have on the child's educational program.  Therefore, we do not agree with the commenter that additional procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure that parents who agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary are aware of the implications of their decision.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.226(d), consistent with section 613(f)(4) of the Act, requires LEAs that develop and maintain coordinated, early intervening services to annually report to their SEA on the number of children receiving early intervening services and the number of those children who eventually are identified as children with disabilities and receive special education and related services during the preceding two year period (i.e., the two years after the child has received early intervening services).  We believe that these data are sufficient to provide LEAs and SEAs with the information needed to determine the impact of early intervening services on children and to determine if these services reduce the number of referrals for special education and related services.  Requiring LEAs to collect and report data on the implementation of early intervening services beyond what is specifically required in section 613(f)(4) of the Act is unnecessary and would place additional paperwork burdens on LEAs and SEAs.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.18(c)(2) requires that if a teacher (who is teaching exclusively to alternate achievement standards) is teaching students who need instruction above the elementary school level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to effectively teach to those standards.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that teachers exclusively teaching children who are assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards above the elementary level have sufficient subject matter knowledge to effectively instruct in each of the core academic subjects being taught, at the level of difficulty being taught.  For example, if a high school student (determined by the IEP Team to be assessed against alternate achievement standards) has knowledge and skills in math at the 7th grade level, but in all other areas functions at the elementary level, the teacher would need to have knowledge in 7th grade math in order to effectively teach the student to meet the 7th grade math standards.

In many ways, there is no substantive difference between serving a child with a cochlear implant in a school setting and serving a child with a hearing aid.  The externally worn speech processor connected with the surgically implanted device is similar to a hearing aid in that it must be turned on and properly functioning in order for the child to benefit from his or her education.  Parents of children with cochlear implants and parents of children with hearing aids both frequently bring to school extra batteries, cords, and other parts for the hearing aids and externally worn speech processors connected with the surgically-implanted devices, especially for younger children.

It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </span></dd>

will affect a school district's adequate yearly progress (AYP) 
reporting under the ESEA and whether children who previously received 
special education and related services would be counted in the special 
education subgroup. The commenters requested clarification as to 
whether the student will remain in the students with disabilities 
subgroup if services are discontinued after school has begun but before 
the State assessment is administered and whether or not the State will 
be required to provide accommodations on assessments to the student. 
Another commenter expressed concern that teachers will be blamed if a 
child fails to succeed after a parent revokes consent for the continued 
provision of special education and related services because educators 
are ``liable'' for all students under the ESEA. One commenter expressed 
concern about an LEA's and State's ability to accurately track the 
progress of students with disabilities over time, especially if large 
numbers of parents choose to exercise their right to revoke consent. 
Lastly, another commenter expressed concern that a parent who 
unilaterally withdraws his or her child from special education and

Discussion:  Section 300.300(a)(3), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that if a parent of a child enrolled in public school, or seeking to be enrolled in public school, does not provide consent for an initial evaluation, or the parent "fails to respond" to a request to provide consent, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedural safeguards, if appropriate, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such parental consent.  The meaning of "fails to respond," in this context, is generally understood to mean that, in spite of a public agency's efforts to obtain consent for an initial evaluation, the parent has not indicated whether the parent consents or refuses consent to the evaluation.

Nevertheless, we do believe that it is important to clarify that a parent is not entitled to more than one IEE at public expense when the parent disagrees with a specific evaluation or reevaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  Therefore, we are adding a new paragraph (b)(5) in Sec. 300.502 to clarify that a parent is entitled to only one IEE each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.  This regulatory provision is consistent with a parent's statutory right to an IEE at public expense, while recognizing that public agencies should not be required to bear the cost of more than one IEE when a parent disagrees with an evaluation conducted or obtained by the public agency.  </span></dd>

The cost of demonstrating subject area competence depends on the number of special education teachers who teach core academic subjects exclusively to children assessed against alternate achievement standards, the number of these teachers who already would be considered highly qualified under section 9101(23) of the ESEA and the number who would not, and the cost of helping special education teachers who are not highly qualified meet the highly qualified teacher requirements for teaching core academic subjects at the middle and high school levels (or replacing them with highly qualified teachers).  The final regulations will generate savings for public agencies to the extent that the cost of helping teachers demonstrate subject area competence at the elementary level and obtain the knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to teach to alternate achievement standards is lower than the cost of demonstrating subject matter competence at the level (middle or high school) at which they are teaching.</span></dd>

Although it is difficult to estimate the savings from these final regulations, the Secretary expects some savings to be produced because affected special education teachers are not required to demonstrate the same level of content knowledge as other middle and high school teachers of core academic subjects, thereby reducing the amount of additional coursework or professional development that is needed to meet State standards.  The savings depend on the gap between what State standards require in terms of content knowledge for middle and high school teachers in various academic areas and what the affected teachers are able to demonstrate in the academic subjects they are teaching.  Any savings will be offset in part by the cost of developing a means for the affected teachers to demonstrate subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided.

While school personnel are not required to use the new authority to remove children who have inflicted serious bodily injury or to remove children for the total amount of time that is authorized, we acknowledge that it would create additional costs for schools that choose to take full advantage of this authority because of the added costs of providing services in interim alternative educational settings.  Using data from a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we estimate that approximately 3,007 children will be removed to an interim alternative educational setting in 2006-2007 for misconduct involving drugs or weapons and at least another 1,283 for misconduct involving serious bodily injury.  Although we do not have data on the costs of educating these children in an alternative setting for 45 school days, the Secretary concludes that the costs of doing so will be outweighed by the qualitative benefits to schools associated with ensuring children a safe and orderly environment that is conducive to learning.</span></dd>

Discussion:  A child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether transportation between school and other locations is necessary in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Likewise, if a child's IEP Team determines that supports or modifications are needed in order for the child to be transported so that the child can receive FAPE, the child must receive the necessary transportation and supports at no cost to the parents.  We believe the definition of transportation is sufficiently broad to address the commenters' concerns.  Therefore, we decline to make the requested changes to the definition.</span></dd>

A few of these commenters requested that the regulations include specific criteria to be used when making a case-by-case determination.

One commenter expressed concern that permitting school personnel to consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining a change in placement may result in schools applying this provision to cases for which it was not intended, potentially resulting in a denial of FAPE.  Other commenters requested clarifying that a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, and expression of remorse should be factors considered when making a case-by-case determination.

Because fewer factors need to be considered during each manifestation determination review, the time required to conduct such reviews will likely be reduced, and some minimal savings may be realized.  However, the more significant impact relates to secondary effects.  Because it will be less burdensome for school personnel to conduct manifestation determinations, it is reasonable to expect an overall increase in the number of these reviews as school personnel take advantage of the streamlined process to pursue disciplinary actions against those children with disabilities who commit serious violations of student codes of conduct.  This prediction is consistent with a recent GAO report ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), which found that a "sizable minority of principals" voiced concern that discipline policies under previous law impeded proper disciplinary action for students with disabilities, and that some of these comments "may have stemmed from the additional time and resources that principals reportedly use to discipline special education students compared with regular education students."  Even more importantly, the changes in the law will make it easier for review team members to conclude that the behavior in question is not a manifestation of a child's disability, enabling school personnel to apply disciplinary sanctions in more cases involving children with disabilities.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
For services that are not necessary to provide access to education by maintaining the health or safety of the child while in school, the distinguishing factor between those services that are not covered under the Act, such as mapping, and those that are covered, such as verifying that a cochlear implant is functioning properly, in large measure, is the level of expertise required.  The maintenance and monitoring of surgically implanted devices require the expertise of a licensed physician or an individual with specialized technical expertise beyond that typically available from school personnel.  On the other hand, trained lay persons or nurses can routinely check an externally worn processor connected with a surgically implanted device to determine if the batteries are charged and the external processor is operating.  (As discussed below, the Act does require public agencies to provide those services that are otherwise related services and are necessary to maintain a child's health or safety in school even if those services require specialized training.)  Teachers and related services providers can be taught to first check the externally worn speech processor to make sure it is turned on, the volume and sensitivity settings are correct, and the cable is connected, in much the same manner as they are taught to make sure a hearing aid is properly functioning.  To allow a child to sit in a classroom when the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant is not functioning is to effectively exclude the child from receiving an appropriate education.  Therefore, we believe it is important to clarify that a public agency is responsible for the routine checking of the external components of a surgically implanted device in much the same manner as a public agency is responsible for the proper functioning of hearing aids.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe it is appropriate to use the phrase, "initial provision of services" in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii), rather than the statutory phrase "consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services," in section 614(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act to clarify that consent does not need to be sought every time a particular service is provided to the child.  In addition, the distinction between consent for an initial evaluation and consent for initial services is more clearly conveyed in Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(ii) than in the statutory language, and is consistent with the Department's longstanding position that "placement" refers to the provision of special education services, rather than a specific place, such as a specific classroom or specific school.  We, therefore, decline to change the regulation, as requested by the commenter.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe that the changes recommended by the commenters need to be made to Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i).  Whether a child needs positive behavioral interventions and supports is an individual determination that is made by each child's IEP Team.  Section 300.321(a)(2)(i) requires the IEP Team, in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others, to consider the use of positive behavioral supports, and other strategies to address that behavior.

For children who are at least three years of age, the IFSP must also include an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills.

The previous regulations required a school district to conduct an evaluation of each child served under the Act every three years to determine, among other things, whether the child was still eligible for special education.  The previous regulations also permitted the evaluation team to dispense with additional tests to determine the child's continued eligibility if the team concluded that this information was not needed and the parents provided consent.  Section 300.303(b)(2) permits districts to dispense with the triennial evaluation when the child's parents and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  The impact of this change depends on the following factors:  the number of children eligible for a reevaluation, the cost of the evaluation, and the extent to which districts and parents agree to waive reevaluations.</span></dd>

Studies of best practices conducted by the National Center on Secondary Education and Transition indicate that effective transition planning requires structured interagency collaboration.

The previous regulations focused on administrative contact instead of active strategic partnerships between agencies that facilitate seamless transitions for children with disabilities between school and adult settings.  For this reason, the Department believes that the elimination of the non-statutory requirement that public agencies make additional attempts to contact other agencies will reduce administrative burden and allow public agencies to focus their efforts on interagency collaborative transition planning for children with disabilities.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c) was added to clarify that a parent may send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE mandate.  A parent has always had this option; a parent who chooses this option for the child does not violate the LRE mandate as long as the child is educated with his or her peers without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate.  However, we agree that this phrase is unnecessary, confusing, and may be misunderstood to mean that parents have a right to veto the placement decision made by the group of individuals in Sec. 300.116(a)(1).  We will, therefore, remove the phrase. </span></dd>

Although the Act does not require that each school building in an LEA be able to provide all the special education and related services for all types and severities of disabilities, the LEA has an obligation to make available a full continuum of alternative placement options that maximize opportunities for its children with disabilities to be educated with nondisabled peers to the extent appropriate.  In all cases, placement decisions must be individually determined on the basis of each child's abilities and needs and each child's IEP, and not solely on factors such as category of disability, severity of disability, availability of special education and related services, configuration of the service delivery system, availability of space, or administrative convenience.  </span></dd>

We believe this responsibility includes child find for children who reside in other States but who attend private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) of the Act is clear about which LEA is responsible for child find and the Act does not provide an exception for children who reside in one State and attend private elementary schools and secondary schools in other States.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.105(b), as proposed, requires a public agency to ensure that hearing aids worn in school by children with hearing impairments, including deafness, are functioning properly.  This is a longstanding requirement and was included pursuant to a House Committee Report on the 1978 appropriations bill (H. Rpt. No. 95-381, p. 67 (1977)) directing the Department to ensure that children with hearing impairments are receiving adequate professional assessment, follow-up, and services.  The Department believes that, given the increase in the number of children with disabilities with surgically implanted devices (e.g., cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulators, electronic muscle stimulators), and rapid advances in new technologies to help children with disabilities, it is important that these regulations clearly address any obligation public agencies have to provide follow-up and services to ensure that such devices are functioning properly.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  It is important for public agencies to include an explanation of the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and the due process complaint procedures in Sec. 300.507 in the procedural safeguards notice to assist parents in understanding the differences between these procedures.  The reference to "jurisdictional issues" addresses the scope of the State complaint and due process complaint procedures.  An organization or individual may file a State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 alleging that a public agency has violated a requirement of the Act for a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date on which the complaint is received, unless one of the exceptions in Sec. 300.153(c) is applicable.  The Department's longstanding position is that a State must resolve any complaint, and may not remove from the jurisdiction of its State complaint procedures complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child simply because those issues also could be the subject of a due process complaint.  We view the State complaint procedures as a very important tool in a State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities, consistent with sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a) of the Act, to monitor LEA implementation of the requirements in Part B of the Act.  These responsibilities extend to both systemic and child-specific issues.</span></dd>

	We also understand the commenters' concerns that the requirements in Sec. 300.309(b) may result in untimely evaluations or services and that parents must be fully informed about the school's concerns about their child's progress and interventions provided by the school.  Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We will also add a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to ensure that the parents of a child suspected of having an SLD who has participated in a process that evaluates the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, are notified about the State's policies regarding collection of child performance data and the general education services that will be provided; strategies to increase their child's rate of learning; and their right to request an evaluation at any time.

Comment: Many commenters asserted that the proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 would negatively affect future cases as parents unable to 
afford attorneys' fees, or unable to find an attorney knowledgeable 
about special education law, will be faced with the choice of either 
representing themselves or foregoing a due process hearing. Other 
commenters suggested that the proposed regulatory change has the 
potential to disrupt the State system of administrative due process 
hearings when lay advocates are not available to assist parents. One 
commenter noted that lay advocates are necessary to help represent 
parents because school officials are more knowledgeable about the law 
than parents, and there are more school lawyers than there are lawyers 
willing to represent parents in due process hearings. Some commenters 
noted that publicly funded programs providing legal representation to 
persons with disabilities are not funded at the level that meets the 
need for free or low-cost assistance. Another commenter noted that non-
attorney advocates provide a necessary and valuable service to children 
with disabilities, and that limiting the role of non-attorney advocates 
will adversely affect the rights of children with disabilities in due 
process hearings. Other commenters argued that lay advocates serve an 
important function and are an excellent resource for families.

Discussion:  We are maintaining the provisions in proposed Sec. 300.518(c), (new Sec. 300.518(d)), but with one modification.  The basis for this regulation is the longstanding judicial interpretation of the Act's pendency provision that when a hearing officer's decision is in agreement with the parent that a change in placement is appropriate, that decision constitutes an agreement by the State agency and the parent for purposes of determining the child's current placement during subsequent appeals.  See, e.g., Burlington School Committee v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Susquenita School District v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 84 (3rd Cir. 1996); Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Administrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635, 641 (9th Cir. 1990).  To clarify that new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) does not apply to a first-tier due process hearing decision in a State that has two tiers of administrative review, but only to a State-level hearing officer's decision in a one-tier system or State review official's decision in a two-tier system that is in favor of a parent's proposed placement, we are removing the reference to "local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d).  This change is made to align the regulation more closely with case law.  </span></dd>

Discussion: We agree that it is important for parents to be informed that their child will be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. We also believe that it is important that parents, as well as other IEP Team members, are informed about any effects of State or local policies on their student's education that may result from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. As the commenters point out, this information is particularly important in a State where students must pass a particular assessment to be eligible to receive a regular high school diploma. Therefore, we have added a regulation requiring a State to provide IEP Teams, which include the parent, with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify a student for a regular high school diploma). We also have required a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based those standards. This also is consistent with Sec.200.1(f)(1)(iii) and (iv) of the Title I regulations.

Comment:  We received numerous, specific requests to revise Sec. 300.168 to add to the list of individuals who can serve as members of the State advisory panels.  Some commenters recommended requiring State advisory panels to include representatives from the Parent Training and Information Centers and Community Parent Resource Centers funded by the Department under sections 671 and 672 of the Act because their representation would ensure a diverse group of people experienced with children with different disabilities on the panels.  One commenter expressed concern that, without representation from these groups, panel members would make recommendations based solely on their individual circumstances and backgrounds.  A few commenters requested including school psychologists and other student support staff on State advisory panels.  One commenter suggested including a representative of a residential treatment facility as a member on State advisory panels because children in these facilities are a growing population and have specialized needs.

Discussion:  Section 300.135, regarding written affirmation, tracks the language in section 612(a)(10)(A)(iv) of the Act.  Including a requirement in the regulations that the LEA must submit a copy of signed written affirmations to the SEA would place reporting burdens on the LEA that are not required by the Act and that we do not believe are warranted in this circumstance.  We expect that in most circumstances private school officials and LEAs will have cooperative relationships that will not need State involvement.  If private school officials believe that there was not meaningful consultation, they may raise that issue with the SEA through the procedures in Sec. 300.136.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude a State from requiring LEAs to submit a copy of the written affirmation obtained pursuant to Sec. 300.135, in meeting its general supervision responsibilities under Sec. 300.149 or as a part of its monitoring of LEAs' implementation of Part B of the Act as required in Sec. 300.600.

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

Discussion:  The regulations promulgated under section 1111(b)(1) of the ESEA permit States to use alternate achievement standards to evaluate the performance of a small group of children with the most significant cognitive disabilities who are not expected to meet grade-level standards even with the best instruction.  An alternate achievement standard sets an expectation of performance that differs in complexity from a grade-level achievement standard.  Section 602(10)(C)(ii) of the Act, therefore, allows special education teachers teaching exclusively children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards to meet the highly qualified teacher standards that apply to elementary school teachers.  In the case of instruction above the elementary level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided, as determined by the State, in order to effectively teach to those standards.  </span></dd>

We do not agree that allowing middle and high school students with the most significant cognitive disabilities to be taught by teachers who meet the qualifications of a highly qualified elementary teacher fosters low expectations, encourages students to be treated like children, promotes instruction that is not age appropriate, or denies students access to the general curriculum.  Although alternate achievement standards differ in complexity from grade-level standards, 34 CFR 200.1(d) requires that alternate achievement standards be aligned with the State's content standards, promote access to the general curriculum, and reflect professional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible.  In short, we believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.18(c) will ensure that teachers teaching exclusively children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards will have the knowledge to provide instruction aligned to grade-level content standards so that students with the most significant cognitive disabilities are taught a curriculum that is closely tied to the general curriculum.  </span></dd>

Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) clarifies that parents have the 
right to withdraw their child from special education and related 
services. After revoking consent for his or her child, a parent always

determine if the child is a child with a disability who needs special

regulations prevents a parent from requesting an evaluation when their

This is because, consistent with Sec.  300.101, the public agency has 
an affirmative obligation to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. The child's right to have FAPE available does not cease to 
exist upon the revocation of consent. Therefore, a parent may consider 
discipline and graduation requirements when determining whether to

Discussion:  The first element in identifying a child with SLD should be a child's mastery of grade-level content appropriate for the child's age or in relation to State-approved grade-level standards, not abilities.

State-approved standards are not expressed as "norms" but represent benchmarks for all children at each grade level.  The performance of classmates and peers is not an appropriate standard if most children in a class or school are not meeting State-approved standards.  Furthermore, using grade-based normative data to make this determination is generally not appropriate for children who have not been permitted to progress to the next academic grade or are otherwise older than their peers.  Such a practice may give the illusion of average rates of learning when the child's rate of learning has been below average, resulting in retention.  A focus on expectations relative to abilities or classmates simply dilutes expectations for children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

Comment:  We received a number of comments concerning the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction provided by qualified personnel.  One commenter stated that it would be difficult for rural school districts to meet this requirement because of staffing requirements in the regular education setting.  Several commenters stated that the requirement for high-quality, research-based instruction exceeds statutory authority and should be removed, because it provides a basis for challenging any determination under the category of SLD.  One commenter asked for clarification regarding the legal basis for providing high-quality, research-based instruction if the child is not determined eligible for special education.  Another commenter stated that attorneys will read Sec. 300.309(b) as providing a legal entitlement to ESEA, research-based instruction and data-based documentation for every child considered for eligibility under the category of SLD, and that when this standard is not met, will bring the matter to a due process hearing and request compensatory education. </span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters recommended clarifying when parental consent for evaluation should be obtained and when the 60-day timeline to complete an evaluation begins.  Several commenters recommended ensuring that the 60-day timeline for evaluation applies regardless of the evaluation model used.  One commenter asked how scientific research-based interventions could be completed within a 60-day evaluation timeline.  One commenter stated that 60 days may not be enough time to appropriately determine whether a child responds to instruction, particularly for children who have not had exposure to such interventions (e.g., children entering the public school system for the first time).  One commenter asked if the intent of the regulations is to allow a determination that a child has an SLD to take place outside the timeline for an initial evaluation, and stated that without clarification of the intersection between an RTI process (that may, by definition, require additional time beyond that which is permitted for an evaluation) and the required period of time for an initial assessment, the regulations would cause confusion and result in improper evaluations and eligibility determinations.</span></dd>

Comment: A few commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) may result in students removing themselves from services 
when they reach the age of majority. Other commenters asked whether a 
child who reaches the age of majority can hold a school responsible for 
lost services. One commenter suggested adding a new paragraph to Sec.  
300.300(b)(4) that would grant immunity to an LEA if a child with a 
disability attains the age of majority and seeks to sue the LEA for 
failure to make FAPE available because the child's parent revoked 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services. Another commenter asked whether unilaterally withdrawing a 
child with a disability from special education releases the LEA from 
any liability, past or future, with regard to providing FAPE to the 
child and the remedies available for denial of FAPE.

Concerning the comments about a student who reaches the age of 
majority holding a school responsible for loss of Part B services, 
Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(iii) provides that, if the parent of a child 
revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special 
education and related services, the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child because of the failure to provide the child with further 
special education and related services. Therefore, granting the public 
agency immunity is not necessary because the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child if the parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services. Revocation of parental consent releases the LEA from 
liability for providing FAPE from the time the parent revokes consent 
for special education and related services until the time, if any, that 
the child is evaluated and deemed eligible, once again, for special 
education and related services.

Discussion:  Section 300.190 retains the authority for a by-pass in current Sec. 300.480 and includes additional authority for a by-pass, consistent with section 612(f)(1) of the Act, in cases where the Secretary determines that an SEA, LEA, or public agency has substantially failed, or is unwilling, to provide for equitable participation of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  When the Secretary authorizes a by-pass it is important that all parties understand the process by which the Secretary determines the funds that will be deducted from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act to provide services, as well as the actions that are required before the Secretary takes any final action to implement a by-pass.  When such processes and procedures are clearly described, time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions.  The requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.190 through 300.198 provide this information and we believe are necessary to clarify and ensure effective implementation of the by-pass provisions in the Act.  We are making one change to Sec. 300.191(d) to clarify that the Secretary deducts amounts the Secretary determines necessary to implement a by-pass from the State's allocations under sections 611 and 619 of the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517.  We believe these options adequately address circumstances in which comparable services are considered unreasonable. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. ---, 126 S. Ct. 528 (2005) (Schaffer), the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the school district.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  In addition, we are not aware of significant questions regarding the burden of production that would require regulation.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The programs under Parts B and C of the Act differ in their scope, eligibility, and the services available.  Services under Part B of the Act are generally provided in a school setting.  By contrast, services under Part C of the Act are provided, to the maximum extent appropriate, in the natural environment, which is often the infant or toddler's home or other community program designed for typically developing infants or toddlers.  The Department has long interpreted the current educational placement language in the stay-put provisions in section 615(j) of the Act and Sec. 300.518(a) as referring only to the child's placement under Part B of the Act and not to the early intervention services received by the child under Part C of the Act.  We believe that a child who previously received services under Part C of the Act, but has turned three and is no longer eligible under Part C of the Act, and is applying for initial services under Part B of the Act, does not have a "current educational placement."  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

We continue to believe the child find and special education referral system is an important function of schools, LEAs, and States.  School personnel should refer children for evaluation through the agency's child or special education referral system when the child's behavior or performance indicates that they may have a disability covered under the Act.  Having the teacher of a child (or other personnel) express his or her concerns regarding a child in accordance with the agency's established child find or referral system helps ensure that the concerns expressed are specific, rather than casual comments, regarding the behaviors demonstrated by the child and indicate that the child may be a child with a disability under the Act.  For these reasons, we would encourage those States and LEAs whose child find or referral processes do not permit teachers to express specific concerns directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency, to change these processes to meet this requirement.</span></dd>

We also recognize, though, that as a matter of practice, it makes a great deal of sense to attend to behavior of children with disabilities that is interfering with their education or that of others, so that the behavior can be addressed, even when that behavior will not result in a change in placement.  In fact, the Act emphasizes a proactive approach to behaviors that interfere with learning by requiring that, for children with disabilities whose behavior impedes their learning or that of others, the IEP Team consider, as appropriate, and address in the child's IEP, "the use of positive behavioral interventions, and other strategies to address the behavior."  (See section 614(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act).  This provision should ensure that children who need behavior intervention plans to succeed in school receive them.  For these reasons, we decline to make the changes suggested. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the criteria in Sec. 300.530(e)(1) that the LEA, parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team must determine whether a child's conduct is a manifestation of the child's disability is broad and flexible, and would include such factors as the inter-related and individual challenges associated with many disabilities.  The revised manifestation provisions in section 615 of the Act provide a simplified, common sense manifestation determination process that could be used by school personnel.  The basis for this change is provided in note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., pp. 224-225, which states, "the Conferees intend to assure that the manifestation determination is done carefully and thoroughly with consideration of any rare or extraordinary circumstances presented."

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.  We believe that, on the one hand, it would be unreasonably burdensome to read the term as applying to every imposition of discipline, including those that might not result in the child being removed from the regular educational environment at all.  On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.  Therefore, we agree with those commenters who suggested that paragraph (h) of this section should be amended to clarify that the requirement for parental notification applies to a removal that constitutes a change in placement of a child with a disability for a violation of a code of student conduct.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Contrary to the commenter's assertion that a parent must have legal knowledge to file a complaint, we believe the State complaint procedures, which are under the direct control of the SEA, provide the parent and the school district with mechanisms that allow them to resolve differences without having to resort to a more costly and cumbersome due process complaint, which, by its nature, is litigious.  We believe if a State effectively implements its State complaint procedures, both parents and public agencies will generally find the process efficient and easy to initiate.  We further believe that the requirement in Sec. 300.509 that each SEA must develop model forms to assist parents in filing a State complaint in accordance with Sec.

Discussion:  It is not necessary to list the specific personnel who provide services to children with disabilities under the Act and to whom the requirements in Sec. 300.156 apply because the regulations are sufficiently clear that all needed personnel are covered.  This includes personnel who provide travel instruction or therapeutic recreation services; teachers of children with visual impairments, if such personnel are necessary to carry out the purposes of this part; and preschool teachers in States where preschool teachers are considered elementary school teachers.  Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(A) of the Act, requires each SEA to establish and maintain personnel qualification requirements to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act and part 300 are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

Changes: We have added new paragraph (d) to Sec.300.160 requiring a State to provide IEP Teams with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify the student for a regular high school diploma). We also have added a new paragraph (e) requiring a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards.

Discussion:  We believe the definition of travel training already acknowledges the importance of transportation in supporting children with disabilities to fully participate in their communities.  New Sec. 300.43(a)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.42(a)(4)) defines travel training to include providing instruction that enables children to learn the skills necessary to move effectively and safely from place to place in school, home, at work and in the community.  Therefore, we do not believe that further clarification is necessary.  We also do not believe that it is necessary to add travel training to the definition of transition services, as recommended by the commenters.  We believe that IEP Teams already consider the importance of transportation and travel training services in the course of planning for a student's postsecondary transition needs.  It is unnecessary to state that travel training includes instructing children with disabilities other than blindness, as requested by the commenters, because the definition of travel training already states that travel training is appropriate for any child with a disability who requires this instruction.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe the commenter's suggested change should be made.  The concepts of "recoupment" and "likelihood of regression or retention" have formed the basis for many standards that States use in making ESY eligibility determinations and are derived from well-established judicial precedents.  (See, for example, Johnson v. Bixby Independent School District 4, 921 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir. 1990); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983); GARC v. McDaniel, 716 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir. 1983)).  States may use recoupment and retention as their sole criteria but they are not limited to these standards and have considerable flexibility in determining eligibility for ESY services and establishing State standards for making ESY determinations.  However, whatever standard a State uses must be consistent with the individually-oriented requirements of the Act and may not limit eligibility for ESY services to children with a particular disability category or be applied in a manner that denies children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE access to necessary ESY services.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Section 300.110, consistent with section 612(a)(2) of the Act, requires States to ensure that public agencies take steps to ensure that children with disabilities have access to the same program options that are available to nondisabled children in the area served by the agency.  This would apply to dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings.  Therefore, a State would be responsible for ensuring that a public agency that offered dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings to a nondisabled student would have that option available to a student with disabilities whose IEP Team determined that such a program would best meet the student's needs.  However, we do not believe that the Act requires public agencies to provide dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings for students with disabilities, if such programs are not available to nondisabled secondary school students.  Therefore, we are not modifying the regulations.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.  However, the parties may agree to waive the resolution meeting or agree to use the mediation process.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  The purpose of the change in the law is to simplify the discipline process and make it easier for school officials to discipline children with disabilities when discipline is appropriate and justified.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the regulations place great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum.  New Sec. 300.39(b)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(3)) defines specially designed instruction as adapting the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of the child and to ensure access to the general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.  In addition, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general curriculum is a major focus of the requirements for developing a child's IEP.  For example, Sec. 300.320(a)(1) requires a child's IEP to include a statement of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i) requires annual IEP goals to be designed to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services the child will receive, as well as the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided, to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  The definition of social work services in schools in the 1977 regulations included "mobilizing school and community resources to enable the child to receive maximum benefit from his or her educational program."  As explained in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations, the phrase "to receive maximum benefit" was intended only to provide that the purpose of activities carried out by personnel qualified to provide social work services in schools is to mobilize resources so that a child can learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program.  The language in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations also clarified that this provision did not set a legal standard for that program or entitle the child to a particular educational benefit.  The preamble further explained that, during the public comment period for the 1992 regulations, commenters raised concerns that the term "maximum benefit" appeared to be inconsistent with the decision by the United States Supreme Court in Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982).  Therefore, the phrase was revised to read "to learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program."  This is the same phrase used in the 1999 regulations and in these regulations in Sec. 300.34(c)(14)(iv).  Because the language in the 1977 final regulations did not entitle a child to any particular benefit, the change made in 1992 did not lessen protections for a child, and, therefore, is not subject to section 607(b) of the Act. </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of interpreting services clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The nature and type of interpreting services required for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and also limited in English proficiency are to be determined by reference to the Department's regulations and policies regarding students with limited English proficiency.  For example, the Department's regulations in 34 CFR part 100, implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, require that recipients of Federal financial assistance ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by students who are limited English proficient, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The requirement to provide services to students who are limited English proficient and others is also governed by various Department policy memoranda including the September 27, 1991 memorandum, "Department of Education Policy Update on Schools' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students With Limited English Proficiency;" the December 3, 1985 guidance document, "The Office for Civil Rights' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures;" and the May 1970 memorandum to school districts, "Identification of discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin," 35 FR 11595.  These documents are available at http://www.lep.gov.  We do not believe additional clarification is necessary.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>
