Comment:  Several commenters recommended retaining the procedures to govern State advisory panels in current Sec. 300.653 and strengthening the requirements of notice and opportunity for public comment at State advisory panel meetings by mandating publication of meeting dates, agendas, and minutes on Web sites.  A few commenters stated that eliminating the notice requirements and the opportunity to participate in meetings in current Sec. 300.653(d) and (e) will result in fewer low income, hearing-impaired, and foreign-language speaking parents attending State advisory panel meetings.  One commenter expressed concern that the removal of current Sec. 300.653 will result in less panel visibility, less public participation, and that State advisory panels will become "rubber-stamps" for positions taken by State officials.  One commenter stated that the removal of the requirements in current Sec. 300.653 weakens the protection of children with disabilities, and, therefore, violates section 607(b) of the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The issues raised by the commenters are already covered in the regulations.

As noted earlier, a new paragraph (b)(2) has been added to Sec. 300.324 to require the IEP Team to consider the special factors in Sec. 300.324(a)(2) when the IEP is reviewed and revised.

Parents are not parties to this hearing and generally would not appear before the show cause hearing officer, and would, therefore, not be intimidated by a participating lawyer.

Discussion:  We do not agree that the provision should be removed.  This provision is longstanding.  Although the Act prohibits an individual who is employed by a public agency involved in the education or care of the child to be a hearing officer, we believe that it is important to continue to clarify that a person's payment for serving as a hearing officer does not render that individual a public agency employee who is excluded from serving as a hearing officer.  In many instances, public agencies retain hearing officers under contract.  The fact that an individual is hired by a public agency solely for the purpose of serving as a hearing officer does not create an excluded employee relationship.  Public agencies need to ensure that hearing officers conduct due process hearings and it is only reasonable that those persons are paid for their work as hearing officers.</span></dd>

Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  The purpose of the change in the law is to simplify the discipline process and make it easier for school officials to discipline children with disabilities when discipline is appropriate and justified.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

However, when a hearing officer orders an IEE, parental consent would be required under Sec. 300.622(a) for a public agency to release education records to the independent evaluator who will conduct the IEE, since in these situations, the independent evaluator is not an official of a participating agency.

There is no requirement that a party file a State complaint prior to filing a due process hearing, and we believe that the regulation is sufficiently clear about this point.

Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.

Discussion:  The hearing referenced in Sec. 300.532(a) and (c) is the same hearing and not separate hearings.  Paragraph (a) in this section states that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding a placement, or the manifestation determination, or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request a hearing.  Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.

Discussion:  Interpreting services, as defined in Sec. 300.34(c)(4), clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf and hard of hearing.

In addition, a parent always has the right to file a due process complaint and request a due process hearing on any matter concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of his or her child, or the provision of FAPE and may seek to resolve their disputes through mediation.  It is important to clarify that when the parent files both a due process complaint and a State complaint on the same issue, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.  However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152, including using the time limit and procedures in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 300.152.  (See Sec. 300.152(c)(1)).  Under the Act, the decision reached through the due process proceedings is the final decision on those matters, unless a party to the hearing appeals that decision by requesting State-level review, if applicable, or by bringing a civil action in an appropriate State or Federal court.  </span></dd>

The commenter recommended removing Sec.

Comment:  We received numerous comments expressing concern about the resolution process and requesting changes to the regulations to ensure that the resolution process is used effectively to resolve disputes and not to delay or deny the right to a due process hearing.  Some commenters requested that Sec. 300.510(b)(3) be removed because it allows a public agency to delay the due process hearing by scheduling resolution meetings at times or places that are inconvenient for the parent.  Many commenters recommended that if an LEA fails to convene a resolution meeting within the required 15 days, bring the required personnel to a resolution meeting, or participate in a resolution meeting in good faith, the 45-day timeline for a hearing decision should begin on the date that the due process complaint notice was filed.  </span></dd>

By encouraging the party requesting the hearing to clearly identify and articulate issues sooner, the final regulations could generate actual savings by facilitating early resolution of disagreements through less costly means, such as mediation or resolution meetings.  But early identification of issues could come at the cost of more extensive involvement of attorneys earlier in the process.  At the same time, prohibiting the party requesting the hearing from raising new issues at the time of the hearing could result in additional complaints or protracted conflict and litigation.  On balance, net costs or savings are not likely to be significant.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.105(b), as proposed, requires a public agency to ensure that hearing aids worn in school by children with hearing impairments, including deafness, are functioning properly.  This is a longstanding requirement and was included pursuant to a House Committee Report on the 1978 appropriations bill (H. Rpt. No. 95-381, p. 67 (1977)) directing the Department to ensure that children with hearing impairments are receiving adequate professional assessment, follow-up, and services.  The Department believes that, given the increase in the number of children with disabilities with surgically implanted devices (e.g., cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulators, electronic muscle stimulators), and rapid advances in new technologies to help children with disabilities, it is important that these regulations clearly address any obligation public agencies have to provide follow-up and services to ensure that such devices are functioning properly.  </span></dd>

In many ways, there is no substantive difference between serving a child with a cochlear implant in a school setting and serving a child with a hearing aid.  The externally worn speech processor connected with the surgically implanted device is similar to a hearing aid in that it must be turned on and properly functioning in order for the child to benefit from his or her education.  Parents of children with cochlear implants and parents of children with hearing aids both frequently bring to school extra batteries, cords, and other parts for the hearing aids and externally worn speech processors connected with the surgically-implanted devices, especially for younger children.  The child also may need to be positioned so that he or she can directly see the teacher at all times, or may need an FM amplification system such as an audio loop.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </span></dd>

Discussion: The language in Sec.  300.606 is accurate and we 
decline to make the requested change for the following reasons. Section 
300.606 implements section 616(e)(7) of the Act, and requires a State 
that has received notice, under section 616(d)(2) of the Act, of a 
pending enforcement action against the State under section 616(e) of 
the Act to provide public notice of the pendency of that action. 
Pursuant to section 616(d)(2)(B) of the Act, a State that has been 
determined to ``need intervention'' for three consecutive years or 
``need substantial intervention'' in implementing the requirements of 
Part B of the Act, faces enforcement actions and is entitled to 
reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing on such a 
determination. If a State requests a hearing on a determination, the 
Department's final determination would not be made until after that 
hearing. In this situation, the enforcement action also would depend on 
the outcome of the hearing and final determination. Therefore, in a 
case such as this, the public must be notified that the Secretary is 
proposing to take, but has not yet taken, an enforcement action 
pursuant to Sec.  300.604.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Because of the high cost of due process hearings and the low expected cost of conducting a resolution meeting, there would likely be some savings for all parties involved if resolution meetings were relatively successful in resolving disagreements.  For example, California reports an average cost of $18,600 for a due process hearing, while Texas reports having spent an average of $9,000 for a hearing officer's services.  Anticipating that attorneys will participate in approximately 40 percent of the predicted 3,985 resolution meetings (including drafting legally binding agreements when parties reach agreement), we expect resolution meetings to cost just over twice the average cost of IEP Team meetings, or approximately $700 per meeting.  Even with a very low success rate (eight percent), given the expected costs of these meetings compared to the high cost of conducting a hearing, all parties involved would likely realize some modest savings.  However, because disputes that result in formal hearings tend to be the most difficult to resolve, we do not expect that mandatory resolution meetings will be highly successful in resolving such cases.  By definition, these are cases in which the parties are not amenable to using existing alternatives to formal hearings such as mediation.  Moreover, assuming an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000 per due process hearing, even if as many as 20 percent of the 3,985 complaints were successfully resolved through resolution meetings, net savings still would not exceed $10 million.  (Note that it is unclear to what extent data on average mediation and due process hearing costs account for LEA opportunity costs (e.g., cost per teacher and/or administrator participating).  To the extent that these data do not reflect the opportunity costs of participating LEA officials and staff, we have overestimated the potential savings from resolution meetings). </span></dd>

Several commenters expressed concern that parents will have knowledge of their procedural safeguards only when they file a State complaint or request a due process hearing.  Some commenters recommended deleting the requirement in Sec. 300.504(a)(2) for the public agency to give parents the procedural safeguards notice upon receipt of the first State complaint or due process hearing in the school year.  Other commenters suggested amending Sec. 300.504(a)(2) to require that the procedural safeguards notice be provided to parents upon receipt of the first due process complaint in that school year.  Some commenters asked whether parents would receive a copy of the procedural safeguards notice only upon the first filing of a State complaint or a due process complaint, but not twice, if a parent submits a complaint and also a request for a due process hearing in the same school year.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that the process for amending a due process complaint is complex and unnecessarily complicated.  Section 300.508(d)(3) and section 615(c)(2)(E) of the Act allow the party filing the due process complaint an opportunity to amend the complaint to ensure that the complaint accurately sets out their differences with the other party.  The complaint can be amended only if the parties mutually agree in writing to the amendment and are given the opportunity for a resolution meeting, or the hearing officer grants permission to amend the complaint at any time not later than five days before the due process hearing begins.  This process ensures that the parties involved understand and agree on the nature of the complaint before the hearing begins.

The intent of Sec. 300.532(c)(3)(ii) is to allow parties sufficient time to consider the resolution options discussed in the resolution meeting.  However, if the parties do not reach agreement within 15 days of receipt of the parent's due process complaint, the expedited hearing may proceed and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) commence.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), which allows a State to shorten the time periods for the disclosure of evidence, evaluations, and recommendations for expedited due process hearings to two business days, because it will not give a parent adequate time to prepare for hearings, especially when a parent doesn't have a lawyer.  One commenter stated that because LEAs have possession and control of education records, a reduction to two days for disclosure is unfair and creates a hardship on a parent in preparing for the hearing.  Other commenters stated that this provision is inconsistent with section 615(f)(2) of the Act, which requires that not less than five business days prior to a hearing, parties must disclose all evaluations and recommendations that parties intend to use at a hearing.  A few commenters stated that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4) diminishes the protections for children with disabilities and their parents found in the July 20, 1983 regulations, and, therefore, violates section 607(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The concept of burden of proof is not applicable to the manifestation determination, which does not occur in a hearing under the Act.

If the parent disagrees with the manifestation determination, they have the right to appeal that decision by requesting a due process hearing under Sec. 300.532.

Discussion:  The Act no longer requires that the appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement be considered when making a manifestation determination.

Although the addition of serious bodily injury significantly simplifies the process for removing a child who has engaged in such misconduct, the data suggest that the savings from the final regulations will be minimal.  Recent Department of Justice data show that "fighting without a weapon" is by far the most common type of serious misconduct engaged in by all students.  However, State-reported data suggest that, of the 20,000 instances in 2002-2003 in which children with disabilities were suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days, only 1,200 involved serious bodily injury or removal "by a hearing officer for likely injury."  We estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served during the 2006-2007 school year.  Using these data, we project that there would have been approximately 1,283 instances in 2006-2007 in which a school district might have requested approval from a hearing officer to remove a child for inflicting serious bodily injury, if the law had not been changed.  Taking into account the time that would have been spent by both relevant school administrators and the hearing officers and their estimated hourly wages (about $125 per hour for hearing officers and $50 per hour for school administrators), we conclude that the unilateral authority afforded school officials under the final regulations produce only minimal savings (less than $1 million).</span></dd>

The change in how days are to be counted (e.g., from "calendar days" under previous law to "school days" under the final regulations) allows school officials to extend placements in alternative settings for approximately two additional weeks.

Section 300.504(a), which incorporates changes in section 615(d)(1) of the Act, requires that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to parents of children with disabilities only once a school year, except that a copy must also be given when an initial evaluation or parent request for an evaluation occurs; the first time a due process hearing is requested during a school year; when the decision to take disciplinary action is made; and when a parent requests the notice.  The prior law required that a copy of the procedural safeguards notice be given to the parents upon initial referral for an evaluation, each notification of an IEP Team meeting, each reevaluation of the child, and the registration of each request for a due process hearing.

Discussion:  The Department does not agree with the commenter that the notification and hearing procedures included in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 are unnecessary and go beyond what is required in section 612(d) of the Act.  Section 612(d)(2) of the Act states that the Secretary shall not make a final determination that a State is not eligible to receive a grant under this part until after providing the State with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing.  When the Secretary proposes to deny a State's eligibility to receive a grant under Part B of the Act, withhold funds, or take other enforcement action, it is important to all parties that the process through which those issues will be decided is clearly described, so that time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions instead of the underlying issues.

Under section 612(d) of the Act, if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a final determination that a State is not eligible for a grant, the Secretary may not award funds to the State.  The procedures in Sec.

The Secretary's final determination may be appealed through the judicial review procedure described in section 616(e)(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.184.

Discussion:  If a parent obtains an evaluation at private expense, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires a parent to share that evaluation with the public agency.  A privately-funded evaluation that is not shared with a public agency would not be considered an IEE under this regulation.  If, however, the parent chooses to share the evaluation with the public agency, that evaluation may be presented by any party as evidence in a due process hearing, in accordance with Sec. 300.502(c)(2).  Similarly, if a public agency reimburses a parent for an IEE, and the parent disagrees with the results of the IEE, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from introducing that evaluation in a due process hearing over the parent's objection.  We disagree with the commenters to the extent that they believe that parents should have an expectation of privacy regarding an evaluation that is publicly-funded or for which they seek public funding.  We believe it is necessary to change Sec. 300.502(c)(2) to ensure that public agencies have the opportunity to introduce the results of publicly-funded IEEs at due process hearings. </span></dd>

Section 300.507(a) and section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act are clear that a parent or public agency may file a due process complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  A party must file a due process complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.508 prior to the opportunity for a due process hearing under this part.

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that non-attorney 
advocates can perform a valuable service to parties in due process 
hearings. As just one example, non-attorney advisors with special 
knowledge of or training in the problems of children with disabilities 
who speak languages other than English can play an important role in 
accompanying and advising parents who do not speak English at due 
process hearings. However, because the Act is silent about the 
representational role of non-attorneys in due process hearings, States 
are not prohibited by the Act from regulating on that issue. Therefore, 
we make clear, in Sec.  300.512, that whether non-attorneys can 
``represent'' parties in due process hearings is a matter that is 
controlled by State law. There currently are States that prohibit non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, and parties to due 
process hearings in those States need to understand that they may not 
be ``represented'' in a due process hearing by a non-attorney, although 
they may be ``accompanied and advised'' by a non-attorney in the due 
process hearing if that individual has special knowledge or training 
respecting the problems of children with disabilities.

Discussion:  The Act now makes the resolution process a prerequisite to an impartial due process hearing.  Under section 615(j) of the Act, a child must be maintained in the current educational placement while proceedings under the Act are pending, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.518 clarifies that unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current educational placement during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507.  Thus, the Act is clear that the public agency must maintain the child's current educational placement during the pendency of the 30-day resolution process, which is triggered once the parent files a due process complaint under this part, regardless of whether the due process complaint is resolved prior to a due process hearing.  We believe it is important for this to be clear in the procedural safeguards notice.  Therefore, we are changing Sec. 300.504(c)(7) to clarify that the notice must inform parents about the child's placement during the pendency of any due process complaint.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer, the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the LEA.  Where the public agency has requested that a hearing officer remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting, the burden of persuasion is on the public agency.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We are maintaining the provisions in proposed Sec. 300.518(c), (new Sec. 300.518(d)), but with one modification.  The basis for this regulation is the longstanding judicial interpretation of the Act's pendency provision that when a hearing officer's decision is in agreement with the parent that a change in placement is appropriate, that decision constitutes an agreement by the State agency and the parent for purposes of determining the child's current placement during subsequent appeals.  See, e.g., Burlington School Committee v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Susquenita School District v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 84 (3rd Cir. 1996); Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Administrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635, 641 (9th Cir. 1990).  To clarify that new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) does not apply to a first-tier due process hearing decision in a State that has two tiers of administrative review, but only to a State-level hearing officer's decision in a one-tier system or State review official's decision in a two-tier system that is in favor of a parent's proposed placement, we are removing the reference to "local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d).  This change is made to align the regulation more closely with case law.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Section 300.531, consistent with section 615(k)(2) of the Act, provides that the IEP Team determines the interim alternative educational setting for removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Additionally, section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act is clear that, during an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act, the child must remain in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action expires, whichever comes first, unless the parent and the LEA agree otherwise.  Thus, under the Act, whenever a hearing is requested under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the LEA, it is the parties involved in the hearing (i.e., the parent and the LEA), not the IEP Team, that may agree to change the time period of the removal or the interim setting for the child.  We, therefore, do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenter.  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations, however, which would prohibit the parents and the LEA from agreeing to involve the IEP Team in any decision to change the time period of the removal or interim alternative educational setting.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Although Congress did not specifically detail a State complaint process in the Act, we believe that the State complaint process is fully supported by the Act and necessary for the proper implementation of the Act and these regulations.  We believe a strong State complaint system provides parents and other individuals an opportunity to resolve disputes early without having to file a due process complaint and without having to go to a due process hearing.  The State complaint procedures are referenced in the following three separate sections of the Act:  (1) Section 611(e)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, which requires that States spend a portion of the amount of Part B funds that they can use for State-level activities on complaint investigations; (2) Section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act, which provides that nothing in that paragraph creates a private right of action for the failure of an SEA or LEA staff person to be highly qualified or prevents a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, as provided for under this part; and (3) Section 615(f)(3)(F) of the Act, which states that "[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the right of a parent to file a complaint with the State educational agency."  Paragraph (f)(3) is titled "Limitations on Hearing" and addresses issues such as the statute of limitations and that hearing issues are limited to the issues that the parent has raised in their due process notice.  The Senate Report explains that this provision clarifies that "nothing in section 615 shall be construed to affect a parent's right to file a complaint with the State educational agency, including complaints of procedural violations" (S.

Discussion:  The definition of interpreting services clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The nature and type of interpreting services required for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and also limited in English proficiency are to be determined by reference to the Department's regulations and policies regarding students with limited English proficiency.  For example, the Department's regulations in 34 CFR part 100, implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, require that recipients of Federal financial assistance ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by students who are limited English proficient, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The requirement to provide services to students who are limited English proficient and others is also governed by various Department policy memoranda including the September 27, 1991 memorandum, "Department of Education Policy Update on Schools' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students With Limited English Proficiency;" the December 3, 1985 guidance document, "The Office for Civil Rights' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures;" and the May 1970 memorandum to school districts, "Identification of discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin," 35 FR 11595.

For services that are not necessary to provide access to education by maintaining the health or safety of the child while in school, the distinguishing factor between those services that are not covered under the Act, such as mapping, and those that are covered, such as verifying that a cochlear implant is functioning properly, in large measure, is the level of expertise required.  The maintenance and monitoring of surgically implanted devices require the expertise of a licensed physician or an individual with specialized technical expertise beyond that typically available from school personnel.  On the other hand, trained lay persons or nurses can routinely check an externally worn processor connected with a surgically implanted device to determine if the batteries are charged and the external processor is operating.  (As discussed below, the Act does require public agencies to provide those services that are otherwise related services and are necessary to maintain a child's health or safety in school even if those services require specialized training.)  Teachers and related services providers can be taught to first check the externally worn speech processor to make sure it is turned on, the volume and sensitivity settings are correct, and the cable is connected, in much the same manner as they are taught to make sure a hearing aid is properly functioning.  To allow a child to sit in a classroom when the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant is not functioning is to effectively exclude the child from receiving an appropriate education.  Therefore, we believe it is important to clarify that a public agency is responsible for the routine checking of the external components of a surgically implanted device in much the same manner as a public agency is responsible for the proper functioning of hearing aids.</span></dd>

Although it is appropriate for a public agency to establish reasonable cost containment criteria applicable to personnel used by the agency, as well as to personnel used by parents, a public agency would need to provide a parent the opportunity to demonstrate that unique circumstances justify selection of an evaluator whose fees fall outside the agency's cost containment criteria.

There is no requirement that would limit the State's authority to set a time limit longer than or shorter than 90 days and we believe that the regulations are clear that a State may set a longer or shorter time limit under State law.  </span></dd>

We, therefore, are not revising the regulations in light of Congress' clear intent that, when there is an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the public agency, the child shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team pending the hearing officer's decision or until the time period for the disciplinary action expires, which ever occurs first, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise. </span></dd>

The impact of these final regulations will depend on the following factors:  the number of requests for due process hearings, the extent to which disagreements are already resolved without formal hearings, the likelihood that parties will agree to participate in mandatory resolution meetings instead of other potentially more expensive alternatives to due process hearings (e.g., mediation), and the likelihood that parties will avoid due process hearings by reaching agreement as a result of mandatory resolution meetings.</span></dd>

We do not believe further clarification regarding the specific procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.618 and 300.619 is necessary.

The process for determining the educational placement for children with low-incidence disabilities (including children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind) is the same process used for determining the educational placement for all children with disabilities.  That is, each child's educational placement must be determined on an individual case-by-case basis depending on each child's unique educational needs and circumstances, rather than by the child's category of disability, and must be based on the child's IEP.

<dd><span class="contentText">
To determine the impact of this change, it is necessary to estimate the savings created by providing fewer notices to parents who are notified about more than one IEP Team meeting during the year or who file more than one request for a due process hearing.  Given the small number of hearing requests in a year (about 20 per 10,000 children with disabilities), our analysis will focus on the number of parents involved in more than one IEP Team meeting.  Although we lack detailed data on the number of IEP Team meetings conducted each year, we estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served in school year 2006-2007.  For the vast majority of these children, we believe there will be only one IEP Team meeting during the year.  For purposes of estimating an upper limit on savings, if we assume an average of 1.2 meetings per year per child, 1.39 million children will have two IEP Team meetings each year and the change reflected in Sec. 300.504(a) will result in 1.39 million fewer procedural notices provided to parents.  While some people may believe this change represents a significant reduction in paperwork for schools, the actual savings are likely to be minimal given the low cost of producing a notice of this size (about 10 pages) and the small amount of administrative staff time involved in providing this notice to parents (about 10 minutes).  Taking all of this into consideration, total savings are unlikely to exceed $5 million.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Following the publication of the NPRM, the Department reconsidered the subject of confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation.  Section 300.506(b)(9) was included in the NPRM in light of note 208 of Conf. Rpt.

Therefore, we are removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9).  Removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9), however, is not intended to prevent States from allowing parties to sign a confidentiality pledge to ensure that discussions during the mediation process remain confidential, irrespective of whether the mediation results in a resolution.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec.

Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. ---, 126 S. Ct. 528 (2005) (Schaffer), the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the school district.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.

Discussion:  Interim alternative educational settings under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(g) are limited to not more than 45 school days, unless extended by the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532(b)(3) because returning the child to his or her original placement would be substantially likely to cause injury to him or herself or to others.  The 45-school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting, unless extended by Sec. 300.532(b)(3), is a maximum time limit for a change in placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  We decline to change the regulations as suggested by the commenters based on the school year ending before a child completes the ordered school day placement in an interim alternative educational setting (in this example 45 school days).  There is nothing in the Act or these regulations that precludes the public agency from requiring the child to fulfill the remainder of the placement when a new school year begins as agency personnel have this flexibility under section 615(k)(1)(G) of the Act.  </span></dd>

Comment:  A few commenters recommended removing Sec. 300.641(c) because States have reporting policies in place that might not be consistent with these new requirements.  Numerous commenters stated that LEAs often report children with vision and hearing loss who have an additional disability in the category of multiple disabilities, which has resulted in under-reporting of children who are deaf-blind.  The commenters stated that an accurate count of children with deaf-blindness is necessary to ensure that these children receive the specialized communication services they need, and to ensure that a sufficient number of specialists are trained to meet the specialized needs of these children.  One commenter stated that a child's secondary disability should not affect the reporting of the child's primary disability.  Another commenter suggested referring to deaf-blindness as the primary disability, if a child has multiple disabilities.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Sections 300.530(g) through 300.532 incorporate two significant statutory changes relating to the authority of school personnel to remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings.  First, the Act now gives school personnel the authority to remove to interim alternative educational settings children who have inflicted serious bodily injury to themselves, or others.  Under previous law, school personnel were authorized to remove children to alternative settings only for misconduct involving: 1) the use and possession of weapons; and 2) the knowing possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The Act added the commission of serious bodily injury to this list.  In cases involving serious bodily injury, school personnel would be able to unilaterally remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings for up to 45 school days without having to request that a hearing officer review the facts to determine whether or not the child is substantially likely to harm him or herself or others.  Second, the 45-day rule has changed.  Under previous law, students could not be removed to interim alternative educational settings for more than 45 days.  Now, under the Act, the comparable time limitation is 45 school days.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is appropriate to include the language suggested by the commenters because we believe requiring parties to provide evidence under the threat of perjury, permitting parties to review submissions, and allowing one party to cross-examine the other party are contrary to the intent of the State complaint process.  The State complaint process is intended to be less adversarial than the more formal filing of a due process complaint and possibly going to a due process hearing.  To make the changes requested by the commenters will serve only to make the State complaint process more adversarial and will not be in the best interest of the child.  The State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 do not require parties to provide evidence, nor do they require that a State allow parties to review the submissions of the other party or to cross-examine witnesses.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.153(b)(4)(v) requires the complainant to propose a resolution to the complaint only to the extent known and available to the complainant at the time the complaint is filed.  We believe this proposed resolution is necessary because it gives the complainant an opportunity to state what he or she believes to be the problem and how the complainant believes it can be resolved.  This is important because it gives the complainant an opportunity to tell the public agency what is wrong and what it would take to fix the problem from the complainant's point of view.  It also will give the LEA an opportunity to choose either to do as the complainant requests or propose a solution that it believes would resolve the issue raised by the complainant.  Thus, if successful, the parties will avoid an adversarial relationship and possibly the expense of a due process hearing. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>

Comment: Several commenters supported proposed Sec.  300.512 
stating that a parent's right to be represented by non-attorneys at due 
process hearings is best decided by State law. Other commenters 
disagreed with our statement in the preamble to the NPRM that the 
language of the Act is not clear about whether non-attorneys can 
represent parties in due process hearings. These commenters stated that 
the Act and its implementing regulations both provide that any party to 
a hearing shall be accorded the right to be accompanied and advised 
``by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with 
respect to the problems of children with disabilities * * *.'' The 
commenters stated that because the term ``counsel'' is referenced 
separately and distinguished from ``individuals with special knowledge 
or training'' in both the Act and the regulations, the Department 
should conclude that such ``individuals'' may, in fact, be other than 
counsel (i.e., attorneys) and represent a parent in a due process 
hearing. One commenter noted that experienced advocates can be very 
helpful to parents who represent themselves in due process hearings. 
Another commenter stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 should not permit 
a State's rules related to the unauthorized practice of law to prohibit 
a parent from being ``accompanied and advised'' by a lay advocate 
because this would be contrary to the actual text of the Act. Moreover, 
several commenters stated that proposed Sec.  300.512 violates the 
intent of the Act, which they describe as providing parents with the 
broadest opportunities for assistance in due process hearings. These 
commenters stated further that nothing in the language or intent of the 
Act permits the Department's interpretation that States have the 
authority to decide whether parents can be represented by non-attorneys 
in due process hearings under the Act.

Discussion: Section 615(h)(1) of the Act is clear that parties to a 
due process hearing may be ``accompanied and advised'' by counsel and 
by individuals, such as non-attorney advocates, who have special 
knowledge or training regarding the problems of children with 
disabilities. Nothing in these regulations or State law can limit this 
right. However, neither the Act nor the current regulations 
implementing Part B of the Act address the issue of whether individuals 
who are not attorneys, but have special knowledge or training regarding 
the problems of children with disabilities, may ``represent'' parties 
in due process hearings under the Act. Congress considered the question 
of non-attorney representation during the 2003-2004 IDEA 
reauthorization process. The version of H.R. 1350 passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2003 included a provision giving a party the 
``right to be represented by counsel and by non-attorney advocates and 
to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or 
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities'' 
(63 Cong. Rec. H3458 and H3495 (daily ed. Apr. 30, 2003)). The final 
version of the bill enacted in 2004, however, did not adopt this 
language. In other areas, though, the Act, as revised in 2004, now 
specifically addresses duties applicable to ``either party, or the 
attorney representing a party'' (see section 615(b)(7)(A) and (B) of 
the Act). Given that the Act is silent regarding the representational 
role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of 
whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties to a due process 
hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to 
decide. As the commenter notes, even if a State law prohibits non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, the Act still affords 
parties to due process hearings the right to be accompanied and advised 
by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
problems of children with disabilities.

Comment: Many commenters asserted that the proposed changes to 
Sec.  300.512 would negatively affect future cases as parents unable to 
afford attorneys' fees, or unable to find an attorney knowledgeable 
about special education law, will be faced with the choice of either 
representing themselves or foregoing a due process hearing. Other 
commenters suggested that the proposed regulatory change has the 
potential to disrupt the State system of administrative due process 
hearings when lay advocates are not available to assist parents. One 
commenter noted that lay advocates are necessary to help represent 
parents because school officials are more knowledgeable about the law 
than parents, and there are more school lawyers than there are lawyers 
willing to represent parents in due process hearings. Some commenters 
noted that publicly funded programs providing legal representation to 
persons with disabilities are not funded at the level that meets the 
need for free or low-cost assistance. Another commenter noted that non-
attorney advocates provide a necessary and valuable service to children 
with disabilities, and that limiting the role of non-attorney advocates 
will adversely affect the rights of children with disabilities in due 
process hearings. Other commenters argued that lay advocates serve an 
important function and are an excellent resource for families.

Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations because, in light of the Department's longstanding position that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of disciplinary removals that constitute a pattern, we believe requiring the public agency to carefully review the child's previous behaviors to determine whether the behaviors, taken cumulatively, are substantially similar is an important step in determining whether a series of removals of a child constitutes a change in placement, and is necessary to ensure that public agencies appropriately apply the change in placement provisions.  Whether the behavior in the incidents that resulted in the series of removals is "substantially similar" should be made on a case-by-case basis and include consideration of any relevant information regarding the child's behaviors, including, where appropriate, any information in the child's IEP.  However, we do not believe it is appropriate to require in these regulations that the "substantially similar behaviors" be recognized by the IEP Team or included in the child's IEP as recommended by the commenter.  The commenter is correct that what constitutes "substantially similar behavior" is a subjective determination.  However, we believe that when the child's behaviors, taken cumulatively, are objectively reviewed in the context of all the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for determining whether the series of behaviors constitutes a change in placement, the public agency will be able to make a reasonable determination as to whether a change in placement has occurred.  Of course, if the parent disagrees with the determination by the public agency, the parent may request a due process hearing pursuant to Sec. 300.532.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Using data from recent State data collections conducted by the Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special Education (CADRE), in which States reported receiving 12,914 requests for due process hearings during 2000-2001, we estimate that there will be approximately 14,059 requests in 2006-2007.  Because some parties already hire attorneys or consult other resources such as advocates or parent training centers to develop the request for due process, the Department assumes that only a portion of the requests would be affected by this new requirement.  Although we have no reliable data on average attorneys' fees in due process cases, for purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes an hourly rate of $300 as an upper limit.  The Department further assumes that each instance in which a party chooses to hire an attorney sooner as a result of this change will involve no more than three additional hours of work.  Even if we assume that parties requesting the hearing will incur this additional cost in the case of 8,000 of the expected requests for due process, the total costs would not be significant (less than $8 million), and could be outweighed by the benefits of early identification and resolution of issues.  Although such benefits are largely unquantifiable, early identification and resolution of disputes would likely benefit all parties involved in disputes. </span></dd>

We believe that an SEA, in resolving a complaint challenging the appropriateness of a child's educational program or services or the provision of FAPE, should not only determine whether the public agency has followed the required procedures to reach that determination, but also whether the public agency has reached a decision that is consistent with the requirements in Part B of the Act in light of the individual child's abilities and needs.  Thus, the SEA may need to review the evaluation data in the child's record, or any additional data provided by the parties to the complaint, and the explanation included in the public agency's notice to the parent as to why the agency made the determination regarding the child's educational program or services.  If necessary, the SEA may need to interview appropriate individuals, to determine whether the agency followed procedures and applied standards that are consistent with State standards, including the requirements of Part B of the Act, and whether the determination made by the public agency is consistent with those standards and supported by the data.  The SEA may, in its effort to resolve a complaint, determine that interviews with appropriate individuals are necessary for the SEA to obtain the relevant information needed to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or of part 300.  However, such interviews conducted by the SEA, as part of its effort to resolve a State complaint, are not intended to be comparable to the requirement in section 615(h)(2) of the Act, which provides any party to a due process hearing the right to present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of social work services in schools includes examples of the types of social work services that may be provided.  It is not a prescriptive or exhaustive list.  The child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether a child needs social work services, and what specific social work services are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is necessary to include functional behavioral assessments in the definition of social work services in schools because providing positive behavioral intervention strategies is just an example of a social work service that might be provided to a child if the child's IEP Team determines that such services are needed for the child to receive FAPE.  Similarly, if a child's IEP Team determines that mobilizing community resources would not be an effective means of enabling the child to learn as effectively as possible because there are no community resources to address the needs of the child, the IEP Team would need to consider other ways to meet the child's needs.  While there is the possibility that a due process hearing might be filed based on a failure to mobilize community resources that do not exist, we do not believe that such a claim could ever be successful, as the regulation does not require the creation of community resources that do not exist.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.148(b) that a parental placement does not need to meet State standards in order to be "appropriate" under the Act is retained from current Sec. 300.402(c) to be consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985) (Burlington) and Florence County School District Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (Carter).  Under the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, a court may order reimbursement for a parent who unilaterally withdraws his or her child from a public school that provides an inappropriate education under the Act and enrolls the child in a private school that provides an education that is otherwise proper under the Act, but does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.  The Court noted that these standards apply only to public agencies' own programs for educating children with disabilities and to public agency placements of children with disabilities in private schools for the purpose of providing a program of special education and related services.  The Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Burlington that tuition reimbursement is only available if a Federal court concludes "both that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school placement was proper under the Act."  (510 U.S. at 12).  We believe LEAs can avoid reimbursement awards by offering and providing FAPE consistent with the Act either in public schools or in private schools in which the parent places the child.  However, a decision as to whether an LEA's offer or provision of FAPE was proper under the Act and any decision regarding reimbursement must be made by a court or hearing officer.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in these regulations a provision relieving a public agency of its obligation to provide tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement in a private school if the child did not first receive special education and related services from the LEA.</span></dd>
