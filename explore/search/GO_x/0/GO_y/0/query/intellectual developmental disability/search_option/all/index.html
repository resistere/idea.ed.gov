Discussion:  Section 300.8(b) states that the use of the developmental delay category for a child with a disability aged three through nine, or any subset of that age range, must be made in accordance with Sec. 300.111(b).  Section 300.111(b) gives States the option of adopting a definition of developmental delay, but does not require an LEA to adopt and use the term.  However, if an LEA uses the category of developmental delay, the LEA must conform to both the State's definition of the term and the age range that has been adopted by the State.  If a State does not adopt the category of developmental delay, an LEA may not use that category as the basis for establishing a child's eligibility for special education and related services.  	Based on the comments, it appears that Sec. 300.8(b) has been misinterpreted as stating that LEAs are allowed to establish the age range for defining developmental delay independent of the State.  We believe it is important to avoid such confusion and, therefore, will modify Sec. 300.8(b) to clarify the provision.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The reporting requirements in Sec. 300.641(c) are not new.  Section 300.641(c) is the same as current Sec. 300.751(e); State reporting policies therefore should already be consistent with these regulations.  Section 300.641(d) addresses how States must report a child with a disability who has more than one disability for purposes of the annual report of children served under the Act.  Paragraph (d)(1) states that if a child has only two disabilities and those disabilities are deafness and blindness, and the child is not reported as having a developmental delay, that child must be reported under the category of deaf-blindness.  Paragraph (d)(2) states that if a child has more than one disability and is not reported as having deaf-blindness or as having a developmental delay, the child must be reported under the category of multiple disabilities.  We believe that Sec. 300.641(d) is clear that children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability must be included in the category of multiple disabilities.  To designate deaf-blindness as the primary disability and include children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability in the category of deaf-blindness would be inconsistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.641(d).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The changes requested by the commenter cannot be made because they are inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.111(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act, explicitly requires that all children with disabilities residing in the State are identified, located, and evaluated.  This includes children suspected of having developmental delays, as defined in section 602(3)(B) of the Act.  We recognize that it is difficult to locate, identify, and evaluate highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities.  However, we strongly believe it is important to stress in these regulations that the States' child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 apply equally to such children.  We also believe it is important to clarify that a child suspected of having a disability but who has not failed, is making academic progress, and is passing from grade to grade must be considered in the child find process as any other child suspected of having a disability.  As noted earlier in the discussion regarding Sec. 300.101, paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 300.111 has been revised to clarify that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The Department does not believe that an assessment of psychological or cognitive processing should be required in determining whether a child has an SLD.  There is no current evidence that such assessments are necessary or sufficient for identifying SLD.  Further, in many cases, these assessments have not been used to make appropriate intervention decisions.  However, Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits, but does not require, consideration of a pattern of strengths or weaknesses, or both, relative to intellectual development, if the evaluation group considers that information relevant to an identification of SLD.  In many cases, though, assessments of cognitive processes simply add to the testing burden and do not contribute to interventions.  As summarized in the research consensus from the OSEP Learning Disability Summit (Bradley, Danielson, and Hallahan, 2002), "Although processing deficits have been linked to some SLD (e.g., phonological processing and reading), direct links with other processes have not been established.  Currently, available methods for measuring many processing difficulties are inadequate.  Therefore, systematically measuring processing difficulties and their link to treatment is not yet feasible....Processing deficits should be eliminated from the criteria for classification...." (p. 797).3  Concerns about the absence of evidence for relations of cognitive discrepancy and SLD for identification go back to Bijou (1942;4 see Kavale, 2002)5.  Cronbach (1957)6 characterized the search for aptitude by treatment interactions as a "hall of mirrors," a situation that has not improved over the past few years as different approaches to assessment of cognitive processes have emerged (Fletcher et al., 2005; Reschly and Tilly, 1999)7.  </span></dd>

The final regulations may impose additional costs on small public agencies that currently lack capacity to conduct repeated assessments of achievement during instruction and provide parents with documentation of the formal assessments of their child's progress.  These costs are likely to be offset by reduced need for psychologists to administer intellectual assessments.  To the extent that small districts may not employ school psychologists, the revised criteria may alleviate testing burdens felt disproportionately by small districts under an IQ discrepancy evaluation model.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.304(b)(3) follows the specific language in section 614(b)(2)(C) of the Act and requires that the evaluation of a child use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical and developmental factors.  "Technically sound instruments" generally refers to assessments that have been shown through research to be valid and reliable.  Therefore, it would be redundant to add language requiring that instruments used in reevaluations be based on scientific research methods, as recommended by one commenter.  The phrase "relative contribution," as used in Sec. 300.304(b)(3), generally means that assessment instruments that allow the examiner to determine the extent to which a child's behavior is a result of cognitive, behavioral, physical, or developmental factors may be used in evaluating a child in accordance with Sec. 300.304.  Because the meaning of "relative contribution" is context specific, we do not believe it should be defined in these regulations.  </span></dd>

A number of commenters stated that it is important that groups use a process to determine whether a child responds to scientific, research-based interventions, as well as consider relevant, empirically validated patterns of strengths and weaknesses in achievement, performance, or both, relative to intellectual development.  One commenter stated that "pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance" in Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) is insufficiently defined and without a clearer definition of "pattern," schools will continue the wait-to-fail model.  One commenter recommended clarifying the meaning of "weakness," stating that weakness does not mean failure, and that there may be specific actions that could address weaknesses in performance that would result in failure if left alone.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe that it is not necessary to modify the regulations to include a requirement that a manifestation determination include a case-by-case analysis of the disability of the child because section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(e) are sufficiently clear that decisions regarding the manifestation determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.  We believe the Act recognizes that a child with a disability may display disruptive behaviors characteristic of the child's disability and the child should not be punished for behaviors that are a result of the child's disability.  The intent of Congress in developing section 615(k)(1)(E) was that, in determining that a child's conduct was a manifestation of his or her disability, it must be determined that "the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, and was not an attenuated association, such as low self-esteem, to the child's disability."  (Note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 225).  The regulation, which follows the statutory language, thus accurately reflects the manner in which the Act describes the behavior of the child is to be considered in the manifestation determination.</span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters recommended adding the concept of psychological processing disorders to the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.  Several commenters noted that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not fully address the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), which includes a processing disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes.  Several commenters stated that, without requiring documentation of a basic psychological processing disorder, the number of children identified with SLD will significantly increase and the use of assessment tools that have the potential to significantly guide instruction will decrease.  Several commenters stated that failure to consider individual differences in cognitive processing skills reverses more than 20 years of progress in cognitive psychology and developmental neuroscience.  One commenter stated that identifying a basic psychological processing disorder would help ensure that children identified with an SLD are not simply victims of poor instruction.  One commenter stated that the shift away from requiring diagnostic assessments in the area of cognition would make it conceptually impossible to document that a child has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes, as required in the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Department agrees that State and districtwide assessments provide important information concerning the child's academic performance and success in the general education curriculum.  However, current Sec. 300.346(a)(1)(iii) was removed, consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act.  Because the language from current Sec. 300.346(a)(1)(iii) was specifically excluded from the Act, we do not believe it is appropriate to retain it in the regulations.  We do not believe that an explicit regulation is needed, however, because Sec. 300.324(a)(1)(iv) requires the IEP Team, in developing each child's IEP, to consider the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child.  A child's performance on State or districtwide assessments logically would be included in the IEP Team's consideration of the child's academic needs.  In addition, as a part of an initial evaluation or reevaluation, Sec. 300.305(a) requires the IEP Team to review existing evaluation data, including data from current classroom based, local, and State assessments. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change the definition of transition services because the definition is written broadly to include a range of services, including vocational and career training that are needed to meet the individual needs of a child with a disability.  The definition clearly states that decisions regarding transition services must be made on the basis of the child's individual needs, taking into account the child's strengths, preferences, and interests.  As with all special education and related services, the student's IEP Team determines the transition services that are needed to provide FAPE to a child with a disability based on the needs of the child, not on the disability category or severity of the disability.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

However, Sec. 300.8(a)(2)(ii) provides that, if a State considers a particular service that could be encompassed by the definition of related services also to be special education, then the child would be determined to be a child with a disability under the Act.  We believe it is important that States have the flexibility to determine whether, consistent with the definition of the term special education in section 602(29) of the Act and new Sec. 300.39 (proposed Sec. 300.38), such a service should be regarded as special education and to identify a child who needs that service as a child with a disability.

It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </span></dd>

When the behavior is related to the child's disability, proper development of the child's IEP should include development of strategies, including positive behavioral interventions, supports, and other strategies to address that behavior, consistent with Sec. 300.324(a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i).  When the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of a child's disability but has not previously been addressed in the child's IEP, the IEP Team must review and revise the child's IEP so that the child will receive services appropriate to his or her needs.  Implementation of the behavioral strategies identified in a child's IEP, including strategies designed to correct behavior by imposing disciplinary consequences, is appropriate under the Act and section 504, even if the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.

Section 300.641(c) addresses counting children who have already been identified as having a disability and is consistent with the requirements in section 618 of the Act.  Section 300.111 addresses child find and the determination of a child's eligibility for special education and related services.  The Act does not require children to be identified with a particular disability category for purposes of the delivery of special education and related services.  In other words, while the Act requires that the Department collect aggregate data on children's disabilities, it does not require that particular children be labeled with particular disabilities for purposes of service delivery, since a child's entitlement under the Act is to FAPE and not to a particular disability label.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Evaluations under section 614 of the Act are for the purpose of determining whether a child has a disability and because of that disability needs special education and related services, and for determining the child's special education and related services needs.

However, if it was determined that learning to use telephone assisted services, was an important skill for a particular child (e.g., as part of a transition plan), it would be appropriate to conduct an evaluation of that particular child to determine if the child needed specialized instruction in order to use such services.  </span></dd>

Discussion: It is inappropriate for school personnel to encourage a 
parent to revoke consent for special education and related services. If 
school personnel believe a child no longer qualifies as a child with a 
disability, Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations provide 
a process for making that determination. Specifically Sec.  300.305(e), 
consistent with section 614(c)(5) of the Act, requires that an LEA 
evaluate a child before determining that the child is no longer a child 
with a disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in 
question and an LEA believes a child may no longer be eligible for 
special education services. A public agency must follow this long-
standing procedure if the agency believes a child should no longer 
receive special education and related services.

Concerning the request for clarification of the child find 
timeline, child find is an ongoing process. The Department expects that 
children whose parents revoke consent will be identified, located and 
offered an evaluation in the same manner as any other child if the 
child is suspected of having a disability and being in need of special 
education and related services. Similarly, we do not agree with the 
commenter that general education teachers will not refer children who 
previously received special education and related services. States are 
required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure effective 
child find. Ensuring that general education teachers make appropriate 
referrals of children suspected of having a disability, which would 
include the referral of children whose parents have previously revoked 
consent for such services, is consistent with this responsibility.

States and LEAs have more discretion over the specific content of an evaluation report for children suspected of having a disability under the other disability categories.  Therefore, whether the SLD evaluation report is more detailed or burdensome than other evaluation reports would depend on State and local requirements.

These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.

Discussion:  We believe that the regulations do not need to be amended to clarify "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" because what constitutes "unique circumstances" is best determined at the local level by school personnel who know the individual child and all the facts and circumstances regarding a child's behavior.  We believe it would impede efforts of school personnel responsible for making a determination as to whether a change in placement for disciplinary purposes is appropriate for a child if the Department attempted to restrict or limit the interpretation of "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case-basis."  Factors such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the violation of a school code could be unique circumstances considered by school personnel when determining whether a disciplinary change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability.  We believe providing school personnel the flexibility to consider whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability on a case-by-case basis and to determine what unique circumstances should be considered regarding a child who violates a code of conduct, as provided for under section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, will limit the inappropriate removal of a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.

Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 incorporates the definition in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.  We do not believe the definition should be changed in the manner suggested by the commenters because the changes are inconsistent with the statutory definition.  The definition in the Act specifically refers to any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of the child and specifically excludes a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Accordingly, we continue to believe it is appropriate to exclude surgically implanted medical devices from this definition.  In response to the second comment, Sec. 300.105(a) requires each public agency to ensure that assistive technology devices (or assistive technology services, or both) are made available to a child with a disability if required as part of the child's special education, related services, or supplementary aids and services.  This provision ties the definition to a child's educational needs, which public agencies must meet in order to ensure that a child with a disability receives a free appropriate public education (FAPE). </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe that the regulations should require public agencies to conduct evaluations for children to meet the entrance or eligibility requirements of another institution or agency because to do so would impose a significant cost on public agencies that is not required by the Act.  While the requirements for secondary transition are intended to help parents and schools assist children with disabilities transition beyond high school, section 614(c)(5) in the Act does not require a public agency to assess a child with a disability to determine the child's eligibility to be considered a child with a disability in another agency, such as a vocational rehabilitation program, or a college or other postsecondary setting.  The Act also does not require LEAs to provide the postsecondary services that may be included in the summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance.

Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) clarifies that parents have the 
right to withdraw their child from special education and related 
services. After revoking consent for his or her child, a parent always 
maintains the right to subsequently request an initial evaluation to 
determine if the child is a child with a disability who needs special 
education and related services. Nothing in the Act or the implementing 
regulations prevents a parent from requesting an evaluation when their 
child has a discipline issue or is at risk of not succeeding in school. 
This is because, consistent with Sec.  300.101, the public agency has 
an affirmative obligation to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. The child's right to have FAPE available does not cease to 
exist upon the revocation of consent. Therefore, a parent may consider 
discipline and graduation requirements when determining whether to

not consider the child to be a child with a disability if the parent 
refuses consent, fails to respond to a request for consent, or revokes 
consent for special education and related services. Other commenters 
stated that revocation of consent for special education and related

parents have revoked consent because the school has prior knowledge 
that the child is a child with a disability and the child has been 
determined eligible for services. The commenters stated that Sec.

Discussion:  We believe it is important to emphasize that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This includes the parent of a child who is a ward of the State.  Therefore, we will add a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to Sec. 300.300 to make clear that a public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed parental consent whenever a public agency seeks to conduct an initial evaluation of a child to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  This requirement applies to all children including children who are wards of the State.  With the addition of this new paragraph, the requirement for public agencies to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation for children who are wards of the State in Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i) is no longer necessary and will be removed.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517.  We believe these options adequately address circumstances in which comparable services are considered unreasonable. </span></dd>

Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.

However, Sec. 300.530(d) is clear that the child who is removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive educational services, to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in his or her IEP.</span></dd>

We continue to believe the child find and special education referral system is an important function of schools, LEAs, and States.  School personnel should refer children for evaluation through the agency's child or special education referral system when the child's behavior or performance indicates that they may have a disability covered under the Act.  Having the teacher of a child (or other personnel) express his or her concerns regarding a child in accordance with the agency's established child find or referral system helps ensure that the concerns expressed are specific, rather than casual comments, regarding the behaviors demonstrated by the child and indicate that the child may be a child with a disability under the Act.  For these reasons, we would encourage those States and LEAs whose child find or referral processes do not permit teachers to express specific concerns directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency, to change these processes to meet this requirement.</span></dd>

The revised manifestation provisions in section 615 of the Act provide a simplified, common sense manifestation determination process that could be used by school personnel.  The basis for this change is provided in note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., pp. 224-225, which states, "the Conferees intend to assure that the manifestation determination is done carefully and thoroughly with consideration of any rare or extraordinary circumstances presented."

Discussion:  The Act no longer requires that the appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement be considered when making a manifestation determination.

However, Sec. 300.532, consistent with section 615(k)(3) of the Act, does provide that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under Sec.

Comment:  Numerous commenters supported proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1), which allowed States to prohibit LEAs from using a severe discrepancy between IQ and achievement (discrepancy models) to determine eligibility under the specific learning disability (SLD) category.  However, many commenters supported the use of discrepancy models and requested that the regulations allow discrepancy models to continue to be used.  Numerous commenters stated that Sec. 300.307(a)(1) exceeds statutory authority and that LEAs should be permitted to use discrepancy models.  Many commenters cited Conf.

Discussion:  Section 300.304(c)(4) requires the public agency to ensure that the child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability.

This is not an exhaustive list of areas that must be assessed.  Decisions regarding the areas to be assessed are determined by the suspected needs of the child.

During the Department's internal review of these regulations, we noted that, while Sec. 300.306(b)(1)(i) refers to lack of "appropriate" instruction in reading, there is no similar qualifier for math.  We believe it is equally important that a child not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor is the lack of "appropriate" instruction in math.

While there may be legitimate issues regarding the provision of services to a particular parentally-placed private school child with a disability an LEA has agreed to serve, the due process provisions in section 615 of the Act and Sec. Sec. 300.504 through 300.519 do not apply to these disputes, because there is no individual right to these services under the Act.

Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</span></dd>

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of 
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under 
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for 
services under Part B of the Act.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: We disagree with the commenter that allowing a parent 
to revoke consent for special education and related services is 
inconsistent with the requirements in section 614(c)(5) of the Act. 
Section 614(c)(5) of the Act requires that an LEA evaluate a child 
before determining that the child is no longer a child with a 
disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in question and 
the LEA believes the child may no longer be eligible for special 
education services. Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent to revoke 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services and does not trigger an LEA's obligation to conduct an 
evaluation for a child that is receiving services before determining 
that a child is no longer a child with a disability. If a parent 
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services for his or her child, the public agency is not 
determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability as 
contemplated by section 614(c)(5) of the Act and Sec.  300.305(e). 
Instead, the public agency is discontinuing the provision of special 
education and related services pursuant to the decision of the parent 
and there is no obligation for the LEA to evaluate the child.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

Discussion:  As noted in the response to the prior comment, public agencies have a responsibility to ensure that a surrogate parent is carrying out their responsibilities, so there are some circumstances when removal may be appropriate.  A mere disagreement with the decisions of a surrogate parent about appropriate services or placements for the child, however, generally would not be sufficient to give rise to a removal, as the role of the surrogate parent is to represent the interests of the child, which may not be the same as the interests of the public agency.  We do not think a regulation is necessary, however, as we believe that the rights of the child with a disability are adequately protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II), which prohibit retaliation or coercion against any individual who exercises their rights under Federal law for the purpose of assisting children with disabilities by protecting rights protected under those statutes.  See, 34 CFR 104.61, referencing 34 CFR 100.7(e); 28 CFR 35.134.  These statutes generally prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance (Section 504) and prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by State and local governments (Title II).  </span></dd>

revocation of consent for special education and related services should 
not affect discipline protections because the school has prior 
knowledge that the child has been determined eligible for services. The 
provisions in Sec.  300.534(c), which mirror the language in section 
615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, are clear that once a parent refuses services 
the public agency will not be deemed to have knowledge that the child 
is a child with a disability and the child will be subject to the same 
disciplinary procedures and timelines applicable to general education 
students.

Section 300.530(d) clarifies that decisions regarding the extent to which services would need to be provided and the amount of services that would be necessary to enable a child with a disability to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and progress toward achieving the goals on the child's IEP may be different if the child is removed from his or her regular placement for a short period of time.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended clarifying that a child who was evaluated and determined ineligible for special education and related services years ago would not be an exception under Sec. 300.534(c) to the basis of knowledge requirement in paragraph (b) of this section.  Many commenters recommended that an evaluation and eligibility determination that is more than three years old not prevent deeming an LEA to have a basis of knowledge.  One of these commenters specifically recommended revising Sec. 300.534(c)(1)(i) to clarify that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec.

Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.

Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that requiring that a child's behavior must be a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under proposed paragraph (b) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) should be removed.  We believe it is sufficient for the public agency to conclude that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of removals that total more than 10 school days in a school year, the behaviors are substantially similar in nature, and such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another support the premise that the series of removals constitute a pattern.  However, our removal of the manifestation determination under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) does not eliminate the obligation to conduct a manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e) if the public agency's determination is that the series of removals constitutes a change in placement.

Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </span></dd>

Whether an augmentative communication device, playback devices, or other devices could be considered an assistive technology device for a child depends on whether the device is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability, and whether the child's individualized education program (IEP) Team determines that the child needs the device in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).  However, medical devices that are surgically implanted, including those used for breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions, are excluded from the definition of an assistive technology device in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.  The exclusion applicable to a medical device that is surgically implanted includes both the implanted component of the device, as well as its external components.</span></dd>

The biological or adoptive parent has all the rights and responsibilities of a parent under the Act, and the LEA must provide notice to the parent, accommodate his or her schedule when arranging meetings, and involve the biological or adoptive parent in the education of the child with a disability.  Thus, if a child is in foster care (and the foster parent is not prohibited by the State from acting as a parent) and the biological or adoptive parent is attempting to act as a parent, the biological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child or a judicial decree or order identifies a specific person or persons to act as the parent of a child. </span></dd>

Section 300.306(a)(1) and section 614(b)(4)(A) of the Act require that a group of qualified professionals and the parent determine whether the child is a child with a disability.

Discussion: If a parent who revoked consent for special education

enrolled in special education, an LEA must treat this request as a 
request for an initial evaluation under Sec.  300.301 (rather than a 
reevaluation under Sec.  300.303). However, depending on the data 
available, a new evaluation may not always be required. An initial 
evaluation, under Sec.  300.305, requires a review of existing 
evaluation data that includes classroom based, local, or State 
assessments, and classroom based observations by teachers and related 
services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the 
child's parents, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether 
the child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec.  300.8, and 
the educational needs of the child. Therefore, a public agency may not

Discussion:  Section 614 (a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an SEA, other State agency, or LEA shall conduct a full and individual evaluation of a child before the provision of special education and related services.  In Sec. 300.301(a), we interpret this language as requiring public agencies, as that term is defined in Sec. 300.33, to conduct evaluations, because those are the only agencies in the State responsible for providing FAPE to eligible children.  The same language is used in section 614(a)(1)(B) of the Act to describe the agencies that may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if a child is a child with a disability.

Therefore, Sec. 300.301(b) states that either a parent or a public agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation.  The language does not include employees of SEAs or LEAs (e.g., teachers and related services providers), unless they are acting for the SEA or LEA, or of other State agencies (e.g., probation officers, social workers, or staff from State agencies that are not public agencies as defined in Sec. 300.33).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that "and" should be used instead of "or" between Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(i) and (ii), because this would subject the child to two different identification models.  We agree that failing a State assessment alone is not sufficient to determine whether a child has an SLD.  However, failing a State assessment may be one factor in an evaluation considered by the eligibility group.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the evaluation must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant information about the child.  Further, Sec. 300.304(b)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act, is clear that determining eligibility for special education and related services cannot be based on any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability. </span></dd>

For children who attend private schools or charter schools or who are home-schooled, it may be necessary to obtain information from parents and teachers about the curricula used and the child's progress with various teaching strategies.  The eligibility group also may need to use information from current classroom-based assessments or classroom observations.  On the basis of the available information, the eligibility group may identify other information that is needed to determine whether the child's low achievement is due to a disability, and not primarily the result of lack of appropriate instruction.

	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.  In addition, children who do not receive appropriate educational services may develop behavioral problems that have a negative impact on the learning environment for other children.  </span></dd>

However, we do not view the consent provisions of the Act as creating the right of parents to consent to each specific special education and related service that their child receives.  Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.

Concerning the comment about ensuring that the parent receives the 
time and information needed to make informed decisions regarding their

been provided to the parents. Therefore, we expect public agencies to 
promptly respond to receipt of written revocation of consent by 
providing prior written notice to the parents under Sec.  300.503. 
Section 300.503 specifies that, within a reasonable time before a 
public agency discontinues services, the public agency must provide the 
parents of a child with a disability written notice of the proposal to 
discontinue services based on receipt of the parent's written 
revocation of consent. Providing such notice a reasonable time before 
the public agency discontinues services gives parents the necessary

Discussion:  Override of parental refusal to consent to a reevaluation is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.300(c) states that each public agency must obtain informed parental consent in accordance with Sec. 300.300(a)(1) prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability.  Section 300.300(a)(3) allows a public agency to override parental refusal to consent to an initial evaluation by utilizing the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516.  The cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(i) to the provision in Sec. 300.300(a)(1) provides the basis for allowing a public agency to override the parent's refusal of consent to a reevaluation.  However, we believe it is important to state this more directly and will, therefore, add language to Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to a reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part.</span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that the IEP Team (defined 
in Sec.  300.23, which includes the child's parents) plays an important 
role in the special education decision-making process. For example, 
through the development, review and revision of the child's IEP, the 
IEP Team determines how to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. However, the IEP Team does not have the authority to 
consent to the provision of special education and related services to a 
child. That authority is given exclusively to the parent under section 
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act. The Secretary strongly believes that a 
parent also has the authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending 
the provision of special education and related services to their child. 
Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of 
special education and related services at any time is consistent with 
the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's 
rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and 
choice in their child's education.

Parents, for example, should understand that it is through the IEP that the child is entitled to the special education and related services that the child's IEP Team determines are necessary to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and to receive FAPE.  If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.

Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. ---, 126 S.

In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the school district.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.

In such States, the State must establish procedures for appointing the parent (or, if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual) to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the remainder of the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Whether parents may retain the ability to make educational decisions for a child who has reached the age of majority and who can provide informed consent is a matter of State laws regarding competency.  That is, the child may be able to grant the parent a power of attorney or similar grant of authority to act on the child's behalf under applicable State law.  We believe that the rights accorded individuals at the age of majority, beyond those addressed in the regulation, are properly matters for States to control.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.  The intent of Congress in revising section 615(k)(5) of the Act was to "ensure that schools can appropriately discipline students, while maintaining protections for students whom the school had valid reason to know had a disability" and that the provisions in the Act should not have the "unintended consequence of providing a shield against the ability of a school district to be able to appropriately discipline a student."  (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 46).  We are not including time restrictions, as suggested by the commenters, to the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section because we believe such restrictions are unnecessary and could have the unintended consequence of hindering the school's ability to appropriately discipline a child.  We believe the basis of knowledge provision in Sec. 300.534(b) is sufficient to ensure that a school had valid reason to know that a child may need special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  A public agency will not be considered to have a basis of knowledge under Sec. 300.534(b) merely because a child receives services under the coordinated, early intervening services in section 613(f) of the Act and Sec. 300.226 of these regulations.  The basis of knowledge criteria is clearly stated in section 615(k)(5)(B) of the Act and Sec. 300.534.  We do not believe that expanding the basis of knowledge provision, as recommended by the commenter, would be appropriate given the specific requirements in the Act.  However, if a parent or a teacher of a child receiving early intervening services expresses a concern, in writing, to appropriate agency personnel, that the child may need special education and related services, the public agency would be deemed to have knowledge that the child is a child with a disability under this part. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 do account for zero tolerance policies by providing public agencies the flexibility to implement discipline policies as they deem necessary to create safe classrooms and schools for teachers and children as long as those policies are fair and equitable for all children and protect the rights of children with disabilities.  If a child with a disability is removed from his or her current placement and placed in an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspended or expelled under the public agency's zero tolerance policy, the disciplinary requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 apply.  Therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to include language in Sec. 300.536 regarding a public agency's zero tolerance policy as such policies are irrelevant to what constitutes a change in placement for disciplinary removals under the Act.</span></dd>

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended removing the reference to manifestation determination in proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii)).  Several of these commenters stated that it is unnecessary since the manifestation determination is reserved for removals longer than 10 school days.  Some commenters stated if the language in proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that a series of removals constitutes a pattern because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year is going to be retained, proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) should be eliminated because it is excessive and has no basis in the Act.  Other commenters found the manifestation determination requirement in proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section "circular" because requiring a child's behavior to be a manifestation of his or her disability before determining that a change in placement has occurred under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) and then requiring that a manifestation determination be conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), whenever a child's removal constitutes a change in placement, is redundant and confusing. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe a specific timeline for an expedited evaluation or an eligibility determination should be included in these regulations.  What may be required to conduct an evaluation will vary widely depending on the nature and extent of a child's suspected disability and the amount of additional information that would be necessary to make an eligibility determination.  However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.  (See section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act).  Further, we believe it would be inappropriate to specify the timeframe from the completion of an evaluation to the determination of eligibility when there is no specific statutory basis to do so.

We agree with the commenters that these regulations should require that, if it is determined that the child's behavior was a direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP, the LEA must take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies.

Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  By including an introductory phrase to proposed Sec. 300.530(e)(1) we intended to clarify that a manifestation determination need not be conducted for removals that will be for not more than 10 consecutive school days and will not constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  In other words, manifestation determinations are limited to removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Upon further consideration, we believe the phrase "except for removals that will be for not more than 10 consecutive school days and will not constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536" is unnecessary and confusing.  We believe limiting Sec. 300.530(e)(1) to the statutory language in section 615(k)(1)(E)(i) of the Act makes it sufficiently clear that within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct a manifestation determination must be conducted and, therefore, we are removing the introductory phrase as it is unnecessary.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.530(g)(3) incorporates the new provision in section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act that permits school personnel to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days without regard to whether the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability if the child has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school, on school premises, or at a school function.  Section 615(k)(7)(D) of the Act is clear that the term serious bodily injury has the meaning given the term in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  That provision defines serious bodily injury as bodily injury, which involves substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Nothing in the Act permits the Department to expand the definition of serious bodily injury, as used in Sec. 300.530(g), to include a bodily injury beyond that included in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h).

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.  We believe that, on the one hand, it would be unreasonably burdensome to read the term as applying to every imposition of discipline, including those that might not result in the child being removed from the regular educational environment at all.  On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.  Therefore, we agree with those commenters who suggested that paragraph (h) of this section should be amended to clarify that the requirement for parental notification applies to a removal that constitutes a change in placement of a child with a disability for a violation of a code of student conduct.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The commenter is correct that section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act does not specifically state that the LEA must "provide a copy" of the procedural safeguards notice but, that the LEA must "notify" the parent of the LEA's decision to take disciplinary action and of all procedural safeguards accorded under section 615 of the Act.  We believe, however, that implicit in the Act is a much higher standard for "notify" than "remind" parents as suggested by the commenter.  Further, in other places where "notify" is used in the Act, it is clear the meaning of the term is "to provide notice " (for example, section 615(c)(2)(A) and (D) of the Act).  We believe Sec. 300.530(h), which requires the LEA to notify the parents of its decision to change the placement of their child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct and provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504, is reasonable and consistent with the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act does not address allocation of the burden of proof in due process hearings brought under the Act, the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed the issue.  In Schaffer, the Court first noted that the term "burden of proof" is commonly held to encompass both the burden of persuasion (i.e., which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced) and the burden of production (i.e., the party responsible for going forward at different points in the proceeding).  In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the LEA.  Where the public agency has requested that a hearing officer remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting, the burden of persuasion is on the public agency.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  </span></dd>

If the parent disagrees with the manifestation determination, they have the right to appeal that decision by requesting a due process hearing under Sec. 300.532.  At the point a due process hearing is requested, the concept of burden of proof would be applicable.

section 619(g) of the Act to eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any 
children with disabilities, ensures consistency across States and an 
equitable distribution of Part B funds. We also recognize that some 
States may not assign child find responsibility to public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs. However, all LEAs, including public 
charter schools that operate as LEAs, have other responsibilities under 
the IDEA that may need to be carried out during the school year, such 
as serving a child with a disability who is identified during the 
school year. It is the Department's position that it is necessary to 
require States to make (rather than give them the option of making) 
subgrants to eligible LEAs not currently serving any students with

States and districts are unlikely to be able to meet these requirements entirely through reciprocity agreements and college and university programs.  The above estimates involve fewer than 7,000 of the approximately 30,000 teachers who lack full certification.  Other options States and districts might use to certify the more than 23,000 remaining teachers include assessments of academic skill and subject matter knowledge and professional development.  Assessment requirements for special education teachers vary across States and teaching assignment fields, but most States require at least two subject matter tests, a general test on core content knowledge, and a disability-specific test, for special education teacher certification.  The average cost of each test is $75.  The SPENSE study found that one-fourth of beginning special education teachers who took a certification test reported having to take it more than once before passing.  If States and districts certified the remaining 23,000 teachers through existing assessments and 25 percent of the teachers took the tests twice, the cost would be approximately $4.3 million.  </span></dd>

When changes to a child's IEP are needed after the annual IEP Team meeting for the school year has been held, Sec. 300.324(a)(4) allows the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency to agree to forego a meeting and develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  Under the previous regulations, the IEP Team was required to reconvene in order to make amendments to an IEP.  Based on our estimate of an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings per child per year, approximately 1.4 million IEP Team meetings beyond the required annual IEP Team meeting would be held during the 2006-2007 school year.  If half of these meetings concerned amendments or modifications to an IEP and parents and agency representatives agreed to forego a meeting and develop a written document in half of these cases, then 350,000 IEP Team meetings would not be needed.  The combined opportunity costs for personnel participating in a typical IEP Team meeting are estimated at $307.

It is unnecessary to state that travel training includes instructing children with disabilities other than blindness, as requested by the commenters, because the definition of travel training already states that travel training is appropriate for any child with a disability who requires this instruction.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  School health services was retained in the definition of related services in Sec. 300.34(a).  However, the definition of school health services was inadvertently removed in the NPRM.  To correct this error, we will add school health services to the definition of school nurse services and clarify that school health services and school nurse services means health services that are designed to enable a child with a disability to receive FAPE.  We will also add language to clarify that school nurse services are provided by a qualified school nurse and that school health services are provided by either a qualified school nurse or other qualified person.  We recognize that most schools do not have a qualified school nurse on a full-time basis (i.e., a nurse that meets the State standards for a qualified school nurse), and that many schools rely on other qualified school personnel to provide school health services under the direction of a school nurse.  Therefore, we believe it is important to retain the definition of school health services and school nurse services in these regulations.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118 apply to all children with disabilities, including preschool children who are entitled to FAPE.  Public agencies that do not operate programs for preschool children without disabilities are not required to initiate those programs solely to satisfy the LRE requirements of the Act.  Public agencies that do not have an inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports must explore alternative methods to ensure that the LRE requirements are met.  Examples of such alternative methods might include placement options in private preschool programs or other community-based settings.  Paying for the placement of qualified preschool children with disabilities in a private preschool with children without disabilities is one, but not the only, option available to public agencies to meet the LRE requirements.  We believe the regulations should allow public agencies to choose an appropriate option to meet the LRE requirements.  However, if a public agency determines that placement in a private preschool program is necessary as a means of providing special education and related services to a child with a disability, the program must be at no cost to the parent of the child.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.117, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, requires that children with disabilities participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities with their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the child.  The Act places great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities are educated, to the maximum extent appropriate, with children who are nondisabled and are included in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities as appropriate to the needs of the child.  We believe the public agency has an obligation to provide a child with a disability with appropriate aids, services, and other supports, as determined by the IEP Team, if necessary to ensure the child's participation in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities.  Therefore, we will clarify in Sec. 300.117 that each public agency must ensure that children with disabilities have the supplementary aids and services determined necessary by the child's IEP Team for the child to participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that child.</span></dd>

	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </span></dd>

Comment:  A number of comments were received regarding Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(ii), which requires each public agency to ensure that the removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that the education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  Many commenters recommended replacing "regular educational environment" with "regular classroom" because "regular classroom" is less likely to be misinterpreted to mean any kind of contact with children without disabilities.  A few commenters expressed concern that using the phrase "regular educational environment" weakens the LRE protections.

Discussion:  Section 300.108 describes two considerations that a public agency must take into account to meet the physical education requirements in this section.  First, physical education must be made available equally to children with disabilities and children without disabilities.  If physical education is not available to all children (i.e., children with and without disabilities), the public agency is not required to make physical education available for children with disabilities (e.g., a district may provide physical education to all children through grade 10, but not to any children in their junior and senior years).  Second, if physical education is specially designed to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability and is set out in that child's IEP, those services must be provided whether or not they are provided to other children in the agency.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe the commenter's suggested change should be made.  The concepts of "recoupment" and "likelihood of regression or retention" have formed the basis for many standards that States use in making ESY eligibility determinations and are derived from well-established judicial precedents.  (See, for example, Johnson v. Bixby Independent School District 4, 921 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir. 1990); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983); GARC v. McDaniel, 716 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir. 1983)).  States may use recoupment and retention as their sole criteria but they are not limited to these standards and have considerable flexibility in determining eligibility for ESY services and establishing State standards for making ESY determinations.  However, whatever standard a State uses must be consistent with the individually-oriented requirements of the Act and may not limit eligibility for ESY services to children with a particular disability category or be applied in a manner that denies children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE access to necessary ESY services.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.  We will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a cochlear implant is an example of device optimization and is not a related service under the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a

concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by 
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.  
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when 
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: While the dispute resolution mechanisms in section 615 
of the Act generally are appropriate to resolve disputes between a 
parent and the public agency, it is the Department's position that they 
are not appropriate when a parent revokes consent for all special 
education and related services. Section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 
Sec.  300.507 allow a parent or public agency to file a due process 
complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, and 
educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of FAPE to the child. However, section 
614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act does not allow an LEA to use the due 
process procedures under section 615 of the Act, including mediation, 
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of 
services. If an LEA cannot use the due process procedures in section 
615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 to override a parent's 
refusal to provide initial consent for services, then an LEA also 
should not be allowed to use these due process procedures to override a 
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of services. 
As discussed throughout this preamble, the Secretary believes that 
protecting the interest of parents to make the decision as to whether 
or not their child receives special education and related services is 
consistent with the intent of the Act.

Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive 
special education and related services, the child is considered a 
general education student and will be considered a general education 
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after 
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State 
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general 
education student who has exited special education for accountability 
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to 
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores 
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the 
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the 
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for 
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a 
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related 
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating 
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the 
State may continue to include the child in the students with 
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two 
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no 
longer be required under the IDEA to provide accommodations that were 
previously included in the child's IEP.

Discussion: Section 615(m)(1) of the Act allows, but does not

State law. If State law grants a child who has reached the age of 
majority under State law (except for a child with a disability who has 
been determined to be incompetent under State law) all rights 
previously granted to parents, then the parents' rights are transferred 
to the child as provided in Sec.  300.520(a), enabling that child to

Discussion: Certain provisions in the Part 300 regulations, such as 
the definition of parent in Sec.  300.30 and the requirements regarding 
surrogate parents in Sec.  300.519, ensure that a child with a 
disability has an individual who can act as a parent to make 
educational decisions on behalf of the child. Parent, as defined in 
Sec.  300.30, means a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a 
foster parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual 
obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from 
acting as a parent; a guardian generally authorized to act as the 
child's parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the 
child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); an 
individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent 
(including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the 
child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child's welfare. The definition of parent also 
includes a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with 
Sec.  300.519 and section 639(a)(5) of the Act. The duty to appoint a 
surrogate parent under Sec.  300.519 arises when no parent can be 
identified, the public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate 
a parent, the child is a ward of the State, or the child is an 
unaccompanied homeless youth, as defined in section 725(6) of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434(a)(6)).

Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </span></dd>

It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.

As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec.

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.

Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  We believe these regulations will ensure that the basic protections regarding hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States to adjust other procedural rules they may have superimposed on due process hearings in light of the expedited nature of these hearings.  Further, we believe it is important that all the due process protections in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are maintained because of the importance of the rights at issue in these hearings.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires an SEA to develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a State plan for a high cost fund.  Under Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i)(A), the State plan must, among other components, establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives from LEAs, a definition of a high need child with a disability that meets certain criteria.  This plan must be developed no later than 90 days after the State reserves funds for a high cost fund.  Section 300.704(c)(3)(ii), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, requires a State to make its final State plan for the high cost fund available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year, including dissemination of such information on the State's Web site.  Although there is nothing in the Act that requires that the public be given the opportunity to comment on the State's plan, there also is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a State from providing an opportunity for public comment prior to finalizing the State's plan for the high cost fund.  We believe the decision to provide opportunity for public comment is best left to each State.</span></dd>

Because fewer factors need to be considered during each manifestation determination review, the time required to conduct such reviews will likely be reduced, and some minimal savings may be realized.  However, the more significant impact relates to secondary effects.  Because it will be less burdensome for school personnel to conduct manifestation determinations, it is reasonable to expect an overall increase in the number of these reviews as school personnel take advantage of the streamlined process to pursue disciplinary actions against those children with disabilities who commit serious violations of student codes of conduct.  This prediction is consistent with a recent GAO report ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), which found that a "sizable minority of principals" voiced concern that discipline policies under previous law impeded proper disciplinary action for students with disabilities, and that some of these comments "may have stemmed from the additional time and resources that principals reportedly use to discipline special education students compared with regular education students."  Even more importantly, the changes in the law will make it easier for review team members to conclude that the behavior in question is not a manifestation of a child's disability, enabling school personnel to apply disciplinary sanctions in more cases involving children with disabilities.</span></dd>

We have minimal data on the number of manifestation determination reviews being conducted.  However, State-reported data for the 2002-2003 school year suggest that schools are conducting a relatively small number of manifestation reviews.  According to these data, for every 1,000 children with disabilities, approximately 11 will be suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days during the school year (either through a single suspension or as a result of multiple short-term suspensions)--the disciplinary action triggering a manifestation review.  (Please note that we have no way of accurately estimating what portion of short-term suspensions that add up to 10 days would be determined by school personnel to constitute a change in placement.  Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this analysis, that 100 percent of these instances would require a manifestation review because they would be deemed a change in placement).  Based on a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we assume that under previous law at least 85 percent of manifestation reviews resulted in disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspensions or expulsion).  In other words, approximately 15 percent of all manifestation reviews did not result in disciplinary action because the behavior in question was determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Section 300.321(e)(1) permits certain members of the IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  The previous regulations required that all IEP Team meetings include the parents of the child, at least one regular education teacher (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), at least one special education teacher, a representative of the public agency, and someone who could interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results (who may be one of the other required IEP Team members).  The extent to which public agencies will realize savings from the final regulations depends on which team members are excused from how much of the meeting.  If the average IEP Team meeting lasts 1.5 hours and requires a half an hour of teacher preparation, then we estimate that the opportunity costs for a teacher of attending a meeting (based on average compensation per hour of $48) would be $96.  If we assume an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings are held for each of the 6.947 million children with disabilities, then 8.34 million IEP Team meetings will be held in 2006-2007.  If one teacher could be excused from five percent of these meetings, the final regulation could result in savings of $40 million.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.  However, to provide additional clarity we will revise paragraph (c)(1) of this section to explicitly state that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the regulations place great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum.  New Sec. 300.39(b)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(3)) defines specially designed instruction as adapting the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of the child and to ensure access to the general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.  In addition, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general curriculum is a major focus of the requirements for developing a child's IEP.  For example, Sec. 300.320(a)(1) requires a child's IEP to include a statement of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i) requires annual IEP goals to be designed to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services the child will receive, as well as the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided, to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </span></dd>

However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</span></dd>

Concerning the comments about written notice of the receipt of a 
parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue 
services and the comment concerning an opportunity to meet with the 
State's PTI center to receive additional information about the 
potential effect of the parent's decision, we have not adopted 
additional procedures for parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services because the regulations already provide 
sufficient notice protections to enable parents to understand the 
implications of the decision they are making. To clarify this point, we 
have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to specify that prior written 
notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 be provided to parents before a 
public agency discontinues special education and related services to 
their child. Public agencies, under Sec.  300.503, are required to give 
the parents of a child with a disability written notice that meets the 
requirements in Sec.  300.503(b) within a reasonable time before the 
public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the 
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or 
the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the 
child. Once a public agency receives a parent's written revocation of 
consent for a child's receipt of special education and related 
services, the public agency, under Sec.  300.503, must provide prior 
written notice to the parent regarding the change in educational 
placement and services that will result from the revocation of consent. 
The notice must include, among other matters, information on sources 
for the parents to contact that can assist the parents in understanding 
the requirements of Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations. 
Section 300.503(c)(1)(i) also requires that this prior notice be 
written in language understandable to the general public. It is 
imperative that the public agency provide the required prior notice in 
a meaningful manner. Accordingly, Sec.  300.503(c)(1)(ii) requires that 
any notice required by Sec.  300.503 must be provided in the native 
language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the 
parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. Additionally, if 
the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a 
written language, Sec.  300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to 
take additional measures to communicate the information contained in 
the notice. These measures involve taking steps to ensure that the 
notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in the 
parent's native language or other mode of communication, that the 
parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written 
evidence that the requirements of Sec.  300.503(c) have been met.
