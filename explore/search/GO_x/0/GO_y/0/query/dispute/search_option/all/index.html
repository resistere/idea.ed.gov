Comment:  Many commenters stated that mediation discussions should remain confidential and not be used in any subsequent due process hearings or proceedings.  The commenters recommended that the phrase "arising from that dispute" in Sec. 300.506(b)(6)(i) and Sec. 300.506(b)(8) be removed.  The commenters viewed these provisions as permitting confidentiality to apply only to the current issue in dispute, and not in other subsequent actions.  Some commenters expressed concern that mediation could be used as "discovery" for some future dispute between parties, or for a simultaneous dispute between the same public agency and some other children, or disputes involving the same lawyers but different parties.</span></dd>

Comment: A few commenters expressed concern about how the 
revocation of consent provisions would affect children who live in 
foster homes, or where guardianship is in dispute. Another commenter 
proposed replacing the words ``the parent'' in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) with 
the words ``each parent'' because when custody of a child is in dispute 
the provision should require that each legally responsible parent 
revoke consent before special education and related services are 
discontinued.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Requiring that the public agency provide an opportunity for the parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to voluntarily engage in mediation in an effort to resolve a dispute is an appropriate minimum requirement and consistent with the statutory provision in section 615(e) of the Act that voluntary mediation be made available to parties (i.e., parent and public agency) to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint.  However, the statute does not require that mediation be available to other parties, and we believe it would be burdensome to expand, through regulation, new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) to require that States offer mediation to non-parents.  Although we do not believe we should regulate to require that mediation be offered to non-parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude an SEA from permitting the use of mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, if available in the State, to resolve a State complaint filed by an organization or individual other than a parent, and we will add language to Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to permit extensions of the timeline if the parties are voluntarily engaged in any of these dispute resolution procedures.  In fact, we encourage SEAs and their public agencies to consider alternative means of resolving disputes between the public agency and organizations or other individuals, at the local level, consistent with State law and administrative procedures.  It is up to each State, however, to determine whether non-parents can use mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution. </span></dd>

strike a suitable balance among the interests of the public agency, 
parent, and child with a disability; the need for proposed Sec.

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517.  We believe these options adequately address circumstances in which comparable services are considered unreasonable. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that consent, as defined in Sec. 300.9, should be required to extend the 60-day time limit because it would add burden and is not necessary.  It is sufficient to require agreement of the parties.  At any time that either party withdraws from mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution, or withdraws agreement to the extension of the time limit, the extension would end.  We believe Sec. 300.152(b) is sufficiently clear that an extension of the 60-day time limit is permissible if exceptional circumstances exist with respect to a particular complaint, or if the parent and the public agency agree to extend the time to engage in mediation.  We also believe it would be permissible to extend the 60-day time limit if the public agency and an organization or other individual agree to engage in an alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State, and the parties agree to extend the 60-day time limit.

We believe that, at a minimum, the State's complaint procedures should allow the public agency that is the subject of the complaint the opportunity to respond to a complaint by proposing a resolution and provide an opportunity for a parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to resolve a dispute by voluntarily engaging in mediation.

Under section 612(d) of the Act, if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a final determination that a State is not eligible for a grant, the Secretary may not award funds to the State.  The procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 detail the process through which the Secretary notifies a State of a proposed ineligibility determination, the hearing available to the State to dispute this proposal, and the process through which the Secretary makes a final determination.  The Secretary's final determination may be appealed through the judicial review procedure described in section 616(e)(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.184.  We decline to address this issue more specifically in the regulations, however, as we think the regulations already adequately convey the idea that only States that the Secretary determines to be eligible can receive a grant.</span></dd>

	Section 300.506(b)(1)(ii), consistent with section 615(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, is clear that mediation cannot be used to deny or delay a parent's right to a hearing on the parent's due process complaint, or to deny other rights afforded under Part B of the Act.  "Other rights under Part B of the Act" include a parent's right to file a State complaint and to have that complaint resolved within applicable timelines.  If the parties involved voluntarily wish to engage in mediation once the complaint is filed, and the mediation is not successful in resolving the dispute, the entity responsible for resolving the complaint at the State level must ensure that the complaint is resolved within the applicable timelines in Sec. 300.152.  Mediation is not an exceptional circumstance that would justify extension of the 60-day timeline for issuing the final decision in a State complaint, unless the parties agree otherwise.  However, as provided in Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii), the parent and the public agency involved can agree to extend the time limit to engage in mediation to resolve the complaint.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Following the publication of the NPRM, the Department reconsidered the subject of confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation.  Section 300.506(b)(9) was included in the NPRM in light of note 208 of Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 216, which indicates the Conference committee's intention that parties could be required to sign confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation, without regard to whether the mediation ultimately resolves the dispute.  However, Sec. 300.506(b)(8), already requires that discussions that occur during the mediation process be confidential and not be used as evidence in any subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding.  Therefore, we are removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9).  Removing Sec. 300.506(b)(9), however, is not intended to prevent States from allowing parties to sign a confidentiality pledge to ensure that discussions during the mediation process remain confidential, irrespective of whether the mediation results in a resolution.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.510(a), consistent with section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the LEA, within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, and prior to the initiation of a hearing, to convene a meeting with the parent and the relevant members of the IEP Team to discuss the parent's due process complaint so that the LEA has an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  Section 300.508(d)(1), consistent with section 615(c)(2)(A) and (D) of the Act, provides that the due process complaint must be deemed sufficient unless the party receiving the due process complaint notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the due process complaint, that the due process complaint does not meet the requirements in Sec. 300.508(b).  If the party receiving the due process complaint notice believes the complaint is insufficient, the hearing officer determines the sufficiency of the complaint.

Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act requires an LEA to convene a resolution meeting with the parent and the relevant member(s) of the IEP Team within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint.  The purpose of the meeting is for the parent to discuss the due process complaint and the facts that form the basis of the due process complaint so that the LEA has an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  We do not believe it is necessary to require an LEA to notify the parent within five days of receiving a due process complaint about the LEA's intention to convene or waive the resolution process.  An LEA that wishes to engage in a resolution meeting will need to contact the parent to arrange the meeting soon after the due process complaint is received in order to ensure that the resolution meeting is held within 15 days.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 615(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act requires the LEA to convene a resolution meeting with the parent and the relevant member(s) of the IEP Team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the complaint.  Section 300.510(a)(4) requires the parent and the LEA to determine the relevant members of the IEP Team who will attend the meeting.  We urge LEAs and parents to act cooperatively in determining who will attend the resolution meeting, as a resolution meeting is unlikely to result in any resolution of the dispute if the parties cannot even agree on who should attend.  The parties should keep in mind that the resolution process offers a valuable chance to resolve disputes before expending what can be considerable time and money in due process hearings.  We decline to regulate further on how to resolve disputes about who should attend these meetings in the absence of information about specific problems in the process.</span></dd>

Comment:  Some commenters stated that the 45-day timeline for a due process hearing should begin when both parties agree that the complaint will not be resolved in a resolution meeting or mediation session.  Other commenters suggested that when a resolution meeting or mediation session is held and it is clear before the end of the 30-day resolution period that the LEA and the parent cannot resolve the dispute, the 45-day timeline should be allowed to begin prior to the end of the 30-day resolution period.  A few commenters requested further clarification regarding how the timeline is counted once the parent participates in a resolution meeting.  A few commenters recommended that the 45-day timeline for the hearing commence once both parties agree that the issue will not be resolved without a due process hearing.  One commenter recommended that the regulations require the waiver to be in writing so that hearing officers have a specific point in time to know when they should be counting the 45 days.</span></dd>

Discussion: While the dispute resolution mechanisms in section 615 
of the Act generally are appropriate to resolve disputes between a 
parent and the public agency, it is the Department's position that they 
are not appropriate when a parent revokes consent for all special 
education and related services. Section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and 
Sec.  300.507 allow a parent or public agency to file a due process 
complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, and 
educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of FAPE to the child. However, section 
614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act does not allow an LEA to use the due 
process procedures under section 615 of the Act, including mediation, 
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of 
services. If an LEA cannot use the due process procedures in section 
615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 to override a parent's 
refusal to provide initial consent for services, then an LEA also 
should not be allowed to use these due process procedures to override a 
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of services. 
As discussed throughout this preamble, the Secretary believes that 
protecting the interest of parents to make the decision as to whether 
or not their child receives special education and related services is 
consistent with the intent of the Act.

Using data from recent State data collections conducted by the Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special Education (CADRE), in which States reported receiving 12,914 requests for due process hearings during 2000-2001, we estimate that there will be approximately 14,059 requests in 2006-2007.  Because some parties already hire attorneys or consult other resources such as advocates or parent training centers to develop the request for due process, the Department assumes that only a portion of the requests would be affected by this new requirement.  Although we have no reliable data on average attorneys' fees in due process cases, for purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes an hourly rate of $300 as an upper limit.  The Department further assumes that each instance in which a party chooses to hire an attorney sooner as a result of this change will involve no more than three additional hours of work.  Even if we assume that parties requesting the hearing will incur this additional cost in the case of 8,000 of the expected requests for due process, the total costs would not be significant (less than $8 million), and could be outweighed by the benefits of early identification and resolution of issues.  Although such benefits are largely unquantifiable, early identification and resolution of disputes would likely benefit all parties involved in disputes. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.  We believe altering this timeframe would be unnecessarily disruptive to States' developed complaint procedures.  For these reasons, we do not believe it is appropriate to change the time limit as recommended by the commenters.</span></dd>
