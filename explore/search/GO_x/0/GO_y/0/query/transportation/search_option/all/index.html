Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to make the change requested by the commenters.  It is assumed that most children with disabilities will receive the same transportation provided to nondisabled children, consistent with the LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.120, unless the IEP Team determines otherwise.  While we understand the commenter's concern, adapted buses may or may not be part of the regular transportation system in a particular school system.  In any case, if the IEP Team determines that a child with a disability requires transportation as a related service in order to receive FAPE, or requires supports to participate in integrated transportation with nondisabled children, the child must receive the necessary transportation or supports at no cost to the parents.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not agree that transportation services should be removed from Sec. 300.139(b).  If services are offered at a site separate from the child's private school, transportation may be necessary to get the child to and from that other site.  Failure to provide transportation could effectively deny the child an opportunity to benefit from the services that the LEA has determined through consultation to offer its parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  In this situation, although transportation is not a related service, as defined in Sec. 300.34, transportation is necessary to enable the child to participate and to make the offered services accessible to the child.  LEAs should work in consultation with representatives of private school children to ensure that services are provided at sites, including on the premises of the child's private school, so that LEAs do not incur significant transportation costs.  </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

	If transportation to an evaluation outside the school environment is necessary, the public agency would have to provide it, as a part of its obligation to ensure that all eligible children are located, identified, and evaluated.  However, we do not believe that the parents need to be notified of this fact because, in most cases, children can be evaluated at school during the school day and there is no requirement that a parent be present during the evaluation.  Thus, requiring that all parents be notified about transportation to evaluations would be unnecessarily burdensome.</span></dd>

Comment:  A few commenters recommended strengthening the definition of travel training in new Sec. 300.39(b)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(4)) and adding travel training to new Sec. 300.43 (proposed Sec. 300.42) (transition services) to acknowledge that transportation is vitally important for children with disabilities to have full participation in the community.  The commenters recommended that the definition of travel training include providing instruction to children with disabilities, other than blindness, to enable them to learn the skills and behaviors necessary to move effectively and safely in various environments, including use of public transportation.</span></dd>

	One commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that an LEA must document that it has made several attempts to address the parent's concerns and clarify any confusion the parent may have about the evaluation, as well as address issues that make it difficult for the parent to bring the child to a scheduled evaluation, such as lack of transportation and childcare.  </span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters suggested requiring a public agency to pay all costs associated with providing FAPE for a child in a private preschool, including paying for tuition, transportation and such special education, related services and supplementary aids and services as the child needs, if an inclusive preschool is the appropriate placement for a child, and there is no inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the definition of travel training already acknowledges the importance of transportation in supporting children with disabilities to fully participate in their communities.  New Sec. 300.43(a)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.42(a)(4)) defines travel training to include providing instruction that enables children to learn the skills necessary to move effectively and safely from place to place in school, home, at work and in the community.  Therefore, we do not believe that further clarification is necessary.  We also do not believe that it is necessary to add travel training to the definition of transition services, as recommended by the commenters.  We believe that IEP Teams already consider the importance of transportation and travel training services in the course of planning for a student's postsecondary transition needs.  It is unnecessary to state that travel training includes instructing children with disabilities other than blindness, as requested by the commenters, because the definition of travel training already states that travel training is appropriate for any child with a disability who requires this instruction.  </span></dd>

Comment:  One commenter expressed concern about including "nonacademic services" in Sec. 300.107, because it is not in the Act.  The commenter stated that services such as athletics, recreational activities and clubs, counseling, transportation and health services should not be included in the regulations because they may be costly and are usually available on a limited basis.  One commenter stated that it is confusing to include related services in the examples of nonacademic services and recommended that they be removed.  </span></dd>

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations include language to require a public agency to provide the following information (in the parent's native language) to a parent who refuses consent or fails to respond to a request for consent for an initial evaluation:  the reasons why the public agency believes the child may be eligible for special education; confirmation that the requested evaluation and any subsequent special education services will be provided at no cost and scheduled in cooperation with parents with transportation provided; the nature of the evaluations and credentials of evaluators; the types of special education services that the child could receive if eligible; and the risks of delaying an evaluation. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.321(b)(3) requires the IEP Team to invite a representative of any agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services, when appropriate, and with the consent of the parent (or a child who has reached the age of majority).  In addition, Sec. 300.154(a), consistent with section 612(a)(12) of the Act, requires each State to ensure that an interagency agreement or other mechanism for interagency coordination is in effect between each non-educational public agency and the SEA, in order to ensure that services needed to ensure FAPE are provided.  Section 300.154(b) and section 612(a)(12)(B)(i) of the Act specifically refer to interagency agreements or other mechanisms for interagency coordination with agencies assigned responsibility under State policy to provide special education or related services relating to transition.  This would include a public agency that is responsible for transportation under State policy.  We believe this is sufficient to address the commenter's concern. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.  We will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that mapping a cochlear implant is an example of device optimization and is not a related service under the Act.</span></dd>
