Under Sec. 300.138(b), each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated by the LEA in which the private school is located to receive special education or related services must have a services plan.  The services plan must describe the specific special education and related services offered to a parentally-placed private school child with a disability designated to receive services.  The services plan also must, to the extent appropriate, meet the IEP content, development, review, and revision requirements described in section 614(d) of the Act, or, when appropriate, for children aged three through five, the IFSP requirements described in section 636(d) of the Act as to the services that are to be provided.

We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to retain in the regulations the requirements in current Sec.

Discussion:  We believe that the data we are requiring the States to provide under Sec. 300.602(b)(1)(ii) are necessary for the proper implementation of the Act.  Providing the most recent LEA performance data and the date the data were obtained will reduce data burden while maintaining the States' accountability for results, specifically related to indicator data that are more difficult to collect because those data are not collected through State-reported data collection systems under section 618 of the Act.  However, the proposed regulations were not as clear as they should have been about the conditions under which States may use monitoring and sampling data.  Therefore, we are revising Sec. 300.601(b) by adding a new provision that specifies that if the Secretary permits States to collect data on specific indicators through State monitoring or sampling, and a State chooses to collect data on those indicators through State monitoring or sampling, the State must collect data on those indicators on each LEA at least once during the period of the State performance plan.  This will require that States collect data to assess each LEA's performance on indicators for which State monitoring or sampling data are permitted during the period of the State performance plan, so that the public will receive specific information about each LEA.  We also are revising Sec. 300.602(b)(1)(ii) to make clear that the required information about specific LEAs would only have to be included in the reports to the public on LEA performance required by Sec. 300.602(b)(1)(i)(A), which should prevent this provision from being interpreted to require LEA-specific reporting to the Secretary.</span></dd>

Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

The new Sec. 300.600(a) identifies specific methods that must be used to ensure correction when an LEA has been determined to need assistance for two consecutive years or to need intervention for three or more consecutive years.  For example, Sec. 300.600(a) refers to Sec. 300.604(b)(2)(i), which discusses the preparation of a corrective action or improvement plan.  In addition, new Sec. 300.608(b) clarifies that States can use other authority available to them to monitor and enforce the Act.  States need the flexibility to select the most appropriate mechanism to ensure correction in a timely manner.

Public agencies will realize savings from the change to the extent that they will not have to continue to contact agencies that declined to participate in IEP Team meetings on transition planning.  In school year 2006-2007, we project that public agencies will conduct 1.193 million meetings for children with disabilities who are 16 through 21 years old.  We used data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) on school contacts of outside agency personnel to project the number of instances in which outside agencies would be invited to IEP Team meetings during the 2006-2007 school year.  Based on these data, we project that schools will invite 1.492 million personnel from other agencies to IEP Team meetings for these students during the 2006-2007 school year.  The NLTS2 also collected data on the percentage of children with a transition plan for whom outside agency staff were actively involved in transition planning.

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of 
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under 
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for 
services under Part B of the Act.

Discussion: Section 300.815, consistent with section 619(g) of the 
Act, requires that each State provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that are 
responsible for providing education to children aged three through five 
years and have established their eligibility under section 613 of the 
Act. Section 613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for 
assistance under Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits 
a plan that provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of 
the conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving preschool 
children with disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. 
Requiring States to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs responsible 
for providing education to preschool children, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will help ensure that LEAs have Part B 
funds available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or 
to serve preschool children with disabilities who subsequently enroll 
or are identified during the school year. As in the past, LEAs may use 
section 619 funds for direct services to preschool children with

Discussion:  The State advisory panel, required in Sec. Sec. 300.167 through 300.169, consistent with section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, addresses many of the commenters' suggestions.  The purpose of the State advisory panel, as stated in Sec. 300.167 and section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, is to provide policy guidance to the SEA with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.168 and section 612(a)(21)(B) of the Act, a broad membership is required.  The duties of the panel are, among other things, to advise the SEA on unmet needs, evaluations, and corrective action plans to address findings identified in Federal monitoring reports, consistent with Sec. 300.169 and section 612(a)(21)(D) of the Act.  However, although we believe that broad stakeholder involvement in the development of the State performance plans and annual performance reports is very important, we decline to regulate that a specific group be involved in their development.  We have, however, provided guidance in OSEP's August 9, 2005 memorandum to States, Submission of Part B State Performance Plans and Annual Performance Reports, (OSEP Memo 05-12), located at http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/bapr/index.html, which directs States to provide information in their State performance plans on how they obtained broad input from stakeholders on the State performance plan.  Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to add any further clarification in Sec. 300.600.  </span></dd>

Collection of Information:  State and LEA Record Keeping and Reporting Requirements under Part B.  Sec. 300.132, Sec. Sec. 300.134 through 300.136, Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, Sec.

The Act requires States and LEAs to gather, maintain, and report various information and data, but the Act does not require this information and data to be submitted to the Department.  In the NPRM, these requirements were reflected in separate information collections.  For the purpose of clarity and efficiency we have combined these separate collections of information into one collection that reflects all the record keeping and reporting that must be completed at the State or LEA level, which do not require reporting to the Department.  The following collections of information referenced in the NPRM are combined into information collection 1820-0600:  LEA Application under Part B of the Act; List of Hearing Officers and Mediators, Complaint Procedures; LEA Consultation with Private School Representatives; Private School Complaint of Noncompliance with Consultation Requirements; Identification of State-Imposed Rules, Regulations, or Policies; Number of Children with Disabilities Enrolled in Private Schools by Their Parents; State Plan for High Cost Fund; Free and Low-Cost Legal Services; and Confidentiality Pledge Prior to the Commencement of Mediation.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
While we agree with the commenters that some areas of noncompliance 
are more difficult to correct than others, we do not agree that the 
timeline should be extended beyond one year. Our experience has been 
that most States can correct noncompliance, including noncompliance 
that is spread broadly across a system, in less than one year from 
identification of the noncompliance. For example, States have required 
the implementation of short-term correction strategies while they are 
developing and implementing a plan for long-term change to ensure 
sustained compliance. An example of a short-term correction strategy 
coupled with a longer-term change might include contracting with speech 
therapists to provide the speech pathology services needed by current 
students while developing an in-district program to support speech 
pathology assistants to become certified speech language pathologists. 
Therefore, Sec.  300.600(e) provides an appropriate timeline for 
correcting noncompliance, including systemic and long-standing 
noncompliance. In cases where a State is unable to correct 
noncompliance within one year of identification, as provided in Sec.  
300.600(e), a State may enter into a compliance agreement with the 
Department under section 457 of GEPA (Compliance Agreement), if the 
Department deems a Compliance Agreement appropriate. The purpose of a 
Compliance Agreement is to allow a State the time needed to correct 
long-standing systemic noncompliance and come into full compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the Federal program as soon as feasible, 
but not later than three years from the date of the Compliance 
Agreement. A Compliance Agreement allows a State to continue to receive 
its grant award under Part B of the Act while it works toward achieving 
full compliance under the terms of the agreement. Section 300.600(e), 
when read together with the provisions in section 457 of GEPA, 
adequately address the commenters' concerns.
