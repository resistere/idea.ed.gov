With regard to the total timeframe from referral to IEP development, this will vary based on a number of factors, including the timing of parental consent following referral for an evaluation and whether a State establishes its own timeframe to conduct an initial evaluation.

The Act does not specify how far in advance of the IEP Team meeting that the written input must be provided to the parent and IEP Team members.  For the reasons stated earlier, we do not believe it is appropriate to impose a specific timeframe for matters relating to the excusal of IEP Team members.

We do not believe it is necessary to add an additional requirement that such parental notification be provided in writing, as suggested by several commenters. Parents are integral members of the IEP Team and, as such, are involved in decisions about how their child will participate in the Statewide assessment system. Section 300.320(a)(6)(ii) of the IDEA regulations already provides that, if an IEP Team determines that a child will not participate in a particular regular State or district-wide assessment, the child's IEP must include a statement of why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and how that child will be assessed. Under Sec.300.322(f), a copy of the child's IEP must be provided to the parents.

We do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on the timeframe within which a public agency must make the IEP accessible to the service providers responsible for implementing the changes, or otherwise notify them of the changes, as this will vary depending on the circumstances (e.g., whether the changes are minor or major changes) and is, therefore, best left to State and local public agency officials to determine.  </span></dd>

Comment:  Several comments were received on the provision in new Sec. 300.301(e) (proposed Sec. 300.301(d)(2)(ii)) that allows an exception to the 60-day or State-established timeframe, only if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure a prompt completion of the evaluation and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  One commenter stated that schools would be unable to meet the 60-day timeframe for children who transfer from another public agency if the new public agency has not been notified of the evaluation timeframe.  Another commenter recommended that exceptions to the 60-day timeframe should not be permitted because the term "sufficient progress" is not defined.

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.  We believe that, on the one hand, it would be unreasonably burdensome to read the term as applying to every imposition of discipline, including those that might not result in the child being removed from the regular educational environment at all.  On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.  Therefore, we agree with those commenters who suggested that paragraph (h) of this section should be amended to clarify that the requirement for parental notification applies to a removal that constitutes a change in placement of a child with a disability for a violation of a code of student conduct.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.301(c), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, requires an initial evaluation to be completed within 60 days of receiving parental consent for evaluation or, if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within such timeframe.  The Department declines to require that a State-established timeframe be less than 60 days or to place additional requirements on States with timeframes of greater than 60 days because the Act gives States the authority to establish different timeframes and imposes no restrictions on State exercise of that authority.  We believe this is evidence of an intent to permit States to make reasoned determinations of the appropriate period of time in which evaluations should be conducted based on particular State circumstances. </span></dd>

Section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, which is incorporated in Sec. 300.300(d)(2), provides that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply if a child enrolls in a school served by the public agency after the relevant timeframe has begun, and prior to a determination by the child's previous public agency as to whether the child is a child with a disability.

While the exception to the 60-day timeframe, as stated in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, only applies when a child transfers to a school located in another public agency, we do not believe the language in paragraph (d)(2), as proposed in the NPRM, is necessarily clear on this matter.  We, therefore, have added language in paragraph (d)(2) to provide additional clarity.  We believe it is important that it is understood that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency.  When a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency, we expect that an initial evaluation will be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the State-established timeframe.  </span></dd>

We do not believe we should require LEAs to report to the State when a child in their district needs a surrogate parent or to require SEAs to track how long it takes LEAs and courts to appoint surrogate parents because to do so would be unnecessarily burdensome.

The phrase "at an IEP Team meeting" following "by the entire IEP Team" was inadvertently omitted in Sec. 300.324(a)(6).

When the Secretary proposes to deny a State's eligibility to receive a grant under Part B of the Act, withhold funds, or take other enforcement action, it is important to all parties that the process through which those issues will be decided is clearly described, so that time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions instead of the underlying issues.

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter. We have received 
numerous inquiries regarding current Sec.  300.606 and whether this

public of enforcement actions taken by the Secretary. We intend for 
Sec.  300.606, as proposed in the NPRM, to clarify the public reporting 
requirements by indicating that a State must provide public notice of 
any enforcement action taken by the Secretary pursuant to Sec.  300.604 
by posting the notice on the SEA's Web site and distributing the notice 
to the media and through public agencies. This clarification is further 
designed to minimize a State's reporting burden while providing the 
public with appropriate notice of the actions taken by the Secretary as 
a result of the determinations required by section 616(d) of the Act

<dd><span class="contentText">
When changes to a child's IEP are needed after the annual IEP Team meeting for the school year has been held, Sec. 300.324(a)(4) allows the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency to agree to forego a meeting and develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  Under the previous regulations, the IEP Team was required to reconvene in order to make amendments to an IEP.  Based on our estimate of an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings per child per year, approximately 1.4 million IEP Team meetings beyond the required annual IEP Team meeting would be held during the 2006-2007 school year.  If half of these meetings concerned amendments or modifications to an IEP and parents and agency representatives agreed to forego a meeting and develop a written document in half of these cases, then 350,000 IEP Team meetings would not be needed.  The combined opportunity costs for personnel participating in a typical IEP Team meeting are estimated at $307.  If drafting a written document to amend or modify an IEP is assumed to cost half as much as a meeting, then this change could result in savings of $53.7 million.</span></dd>

We do not believe it is necessary to define the phrase "sufficient progress" because the meaning will vary depending on the specific circumstances in each case.  As one commenter noted, there may be legitimate reasons for not completing the evaluation within the 60-day timeframe, such as differences in assessment instruments used in the previous and new public agencies, and the length of time between a child leaving one school and enrolling in the next school.

Comment:  We received many comments from individuals expressing concern about allowing IEP Team members to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting.  A few commenters recommended that the regulations require all IEP Team members to attend all IEP Team meetings without exception.  One commenter stated that excusing members from attending IEP Team meetings interrupts the flow of the meeting and takes away time from discussing the child's needs.  Another commenter expressed concern that the integrity of the IEP Team meeting process depends on a discussion to determine the services that are necessary to meet the child's unique needs, and that the richness of this discussion may be diminished if IEP Team members are allowed to be excused too frequently and the IEP Team must rely on written input.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Congress recognized the unique problems homeless children face and included several new provisions in the Act to ensure that homeless children and youth with disabilities have access to the same services and supports as all other children with disabilities.  The Department recognizes that the high mobility rates of some homeless children with disabilities (as well as other children, including some children who are in the custody of a State child welfare agency) pose unique challenges when a child is referred for an evaluation, but moves to another district or State before an evaluation can be initiated or completed.  In such cases, the Department believes it is important that the evaluations be completed as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the date on which the child was first referred for evaluation in any LEA.  However, the high mobility rate of these children and their potential range of evaluation needs means that any specific expedited timeframe could be both too long to ensure that all children are evaluated before they move, and too short to be reasonable in all circumstances.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from establishing its own policies to address the needs of homeless children, including adopting a timeframe for initial evaluations that is less than 60 days.  </span></dd>

	With regard to the recommendation that the notice state that the parent has a legal right to require an IEP Team member to participate in an IEP Team meeting, it is important to emphasize that it is the public agency that determines the specific personnel to fill the roles for the public agency's required participants at the IEP Team meeting.

Therefore, if a speech pathologist, occupational therapist, or other special education provider, other than the child's special education teacher is on the IEP Team, written consent from the parent would be required for the speech pathologist, occupational therapist, or other special education provider to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, when the IEP Team meeting involves a modification to, or discussion of, the IEP Team member's related service or area of the curriculum.</span></dd>

However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.

Discussion:  We believe it is important to retain these requirements in Sec. 300.323(b)(2) because of the importance of the IEP as the statutory vehicle for ensuring FAPE to a child with a disability.  Although the Act does not specifically require a public agency to provide detailed explanations to the parent of the differences between an IEP and an IFSP, we believe parents need this information to make an informed choice regarding whether to continue to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP.  Parents, for example, should understand that it is through the IEP that the child is entitled to the special education and related services that the child's IEP Team determines are necessary to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and to receive FAPE.  If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.  For a parent to waive the right to an IEP, informed parental consent is necessary.  </span></dd>

With respect to a draft IEP, we encourage public agency staff to come to an IEP Team meeting prepared to discuss evaluation findings and preliminary recommendations.  Likewise, parents have the right to bring questions, concerns, and preliminary recommendations to the IEP Team meeting as part of a full discussion of the child's needs and the services to be provided to meet those needs.  We do not encourage public agencies to prepare a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, particularly if doing so would inhibit a full discussion of the child's needs.  However, if a public agency develops a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, the agency should make it clear to the parents at the outset of the meeting that the services proposed by the agency are preliminary recommendations for review and discussion with the parents.  The public agency also should provide the parents with a copy of its draft proposals, if the agency has developed them, prior to the IEP Team meeting so as to give the parents an opportunity to review the recommendations of the public agency prior to the IEP Team meeting, and be better able to engage in a full discussion of the proposals for the IEP.

Discussion:  Beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16 years of age, section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII)(aa) of the Act requires a child's IEP to include measurable postsecondary goals in the areas of training, education, and employment, and, where appropriate, independent living skills.  Therefore, the only area in which postsecondary goals are not required in the IEP is in the area of independent living skills.  Goals in the area of independent living are required only if appropriate.  It is up to the child's IEP Team to determine whether IEP goals related to the development of independent living skills are appropriate and necessary for the child to receive FAPE.</span></dd>

An LEA may not routinely or unilaterally excuse IEP Team members from attending IEP Team meetings as parent agreement or consent is required in each instance.  We encourage LEAs to carefully consider, based on the individual needs of the child and the issues that need to be addressed at the IEP Team meeting whether it makes sense to offer to hold the IEP Team meeting without a particular IEP Team member in attendance or whether it would be better to reschedule the meeting so that person could attend and participate in the discussion.  However, we do not believe that additional regulations on this subject are warranted.</span></dd>

These commenters also recommended that the regulations require the excused IEP Team member to include a telephone number where the IEP Team member can be reached prior to the meeting if the parent wants to contact the member, and a telephone number where the member can be reached during the meeting in case immediate input during the meeting is required.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act does not specify how far in advance of an IEP Team meeting a parent must be notified of an agency's request to excuse a member from attending an IEP Team meeting or when the parent and LEA must sign a written agreement or provide consent to excuse an IEP Team member.  Ideally, public agencies would provide parents with as much notice as possible to request that an IEP Team member be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, and have agreements or consents signed at a reasonable time prior to the IEP Team meeting.  However, this might not always be possible, for example, when a member has an emergency or an unavoidable scheduling conflict.  To require public agencies to request an excusal or obtain a signed agreement or consent to excuse a member a specific number of days prior to an IEP Team meeting would effectively prevent IEP Team members from being excused from IEP Team meetings in many situations and, thus, be counter to the intent of providing additional flexibility to parents in scheduling IEP Team meetings.  Furthermore, if an LEA requests an excusal at the last minute or a parent needs additional time or information to consider the request, the parent always has the right not to agree or consent to the excusal of the IEP Team member.  We, therefore, decline to regulate on these matters.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Under section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, a State must allow a parent and an LEA to agree to excuse a member of the IEP Team.  Section 300.321(e) reflects this requirement and we do not have the authority to make this optional for States.  We also do not have the authority to allow a State to restrict, or otherwise determine, when an IEP Team member can be excused from attending a meeting, or to prohibit the excusal of an IEP Team member when the LEA and parent agree to the excusal.  Whether a State must have policies and procedures to excuse IEP Team members from attending an IEP Team meeting will depend on whether such policies and procedures are required by a State to implement this statutory requirement.

Comment:  Numerous commenters expressed concern about new Sec. 300.300(b)(4)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(b)(3)(ii)), which provides that if a parent fails to consent for initial services or refuses to respond to a request for consent, the public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for the child.  A few commenters stated that this should be permitted only when a parent refuses services, but not when a parent fails to respond to a request for consent for initial services.  A few commenters stated that the regulations should be revised to clarify that this applies only to subsequent IEP Team meetings, not the initial IEP Team meeting.

The commenter recommended that the regulations clarify that the attendance of the other individuals invited to attend the IEP Team meeting by the parent and public agency is discretionary and that no waiver is needed to hold the IEP Team meeting without them.  The commenter recommended revising Sec. 300.321(e)(1) to refer to "mandatory" members of the IEP Team.  Another commenter expressed concern that it is not possible to pre-determine the areas of the curriculum that may be addressed at an IEP Team meeting, and recommended that excusals be permitted only for the IEP Team members identified by the public agency in Sec. 300.321(a). </span></dd>

Section 300.321(e)(2) permits certain members of an IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting that involves a modification to or discussion of the member's area of the curriculum or related service if the parent and the public agency consent in writing to the excusal and the member submits written input to the parent and the other members of the IEP Team prior to the meeting.  The change is unlikely to generate notable savings because reduced time spent in meetings is likely to be offset by the time required to draft written input, send it to the parents and other IEP Team members, and secure the consent of parents and public agency to the excusal.  In cases in which IEP Team meetings take longer than the average time of 1.5 hours, there are likely to be controversial issues or significant modifications to the IEP under discussion.  Parents are presumably less likely to consent to the excusal of team members in these instances.</span></dd>

In some States, this group of professionals may have the same individuals as the IEP Team, but in other States, this is not the case.

Section 300.101, consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act, requires each SEA to ensure that the special education and related services that are necessary for the child to receive FAPE are provided in conformity with the child's IEP.  If an agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP, the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to develop alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the child's IEP, consistent with section 614(d)(6) of the Act and Sec. 300.324(c)(1).</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include emotional issues as a special factor to be considered by the IEP Team.  We decline to add it to the regulations because there are already many opportunities for the IEP Team to consider the affect of emotional issues on a child's learning.  For example, Sec. 300.324(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(3)(A) of the Act, requires the IEP Team to consider the strengths of the child; the concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child; the results of the initial evaluation or most recent evaluation of the child; and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child, all of which could be affected by emotional issues and would, therefore, need to be considered by the IEP Team.</span></dd>

We also do not believe it is necessary to add a regulation permitting States to establish additional procedural safeguards for parents who consent to excuse an IEP Team member, as recommended by one commenter, because we believe the safeguard of requiring consent will be sufficient to prevent parents from feeling pressured to excuse an IEP Team member.  Furthermore, parents who want to confer with an excused team member may ask to do so before agreeing or consenting to excusing the member from attending the IEP Team meeting, but it would be inappropriate to add a regulation that limited parent rights by requiring a conference before the parent could agree or consent to the excusal of an IEP Team member.</span></dd>

Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.

Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.

Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

Implementation of the behavioral strategies identified in a child's IEP, including strategies designed to correct behavior by imposing disciplinary consequences, is appropriate under the Act and section 504, even if the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.  A change in placement that is appropriate and consistent with the child's needs may be implemented subject to the parent's procedural safeguards regarding prior notice (Sec. 300.503), mediation (Sec. 300.506), due process (Sec.

Section 300.321(e)(1) permits certain members of the IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  The previous regulations required that all IEP Team meetings include the parents of the child, at least one regular education teacher (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), at least one special education teacher, a representative of the public agency, and someone who could interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results (who may be one of the other required IEP Team members).  The extent to which public agencies will realize savings from the final regulations depends on which team members are excused from how much of the meeting.  If the average IEP Team meeting lasts 1.5 hours and requires a half an hour of teacher preparation, then we estimate that the opportunity costs for a teacher of attending a meeting (based on average compensation per hour of $48) would be $96.  If we assume an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings are held for each of the 6.947 million children with disabilities, then 8.34 million IEP Team meetings will be held in 2006-2007.  If one teacher could be excused from five percent of these meetings, the final regulation could result in savings of $40 million.  </span></dd>

However, if the IEP Team determines that such services are necessary to meet the needs of the child, and the services are included on the child's IEP, and the parent (or a child who has reached the age of majority) disagrees with the services, the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) can request mediation, file a due process complaint, or file a State complaint to resolve the issue.  We do not believe further clarification in the regulations is necessary.  </span></dd>

One commenter recommended permitting States to establish additional procedural safeguards that guarantee that parents who consent to excuse an IEP member from a meeting do so freely and are aware of the implications of their decisions.  Some commenters expressed concern that a parent could be pressured to agree to excuse an IEP Team member for what, in reality, are economic or staffing reasons.  One commenter stated that parents should have the right to consent to excusal only after conferring with the individual to be excused.  Some commenters recommended that parents be informed that they have a legal right to require an IEP Team member to participate in the meeting.</span></dd>

Discussion:  When an IEP Team member's area is not being modified or discussed, Sec. 300.321(e)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(C) of the Act, provides that the member may be excused from the meeting if the parent and LEA agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary.  We believe it is important to give public agencies and parents wide latitude about the content of the agreement and, therefore, decline to regulate on the specific information that an LEA must provide in a written agreement to excuse an IEP Team member from attending the IEP Team meeting when the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  </span></dd>

Further, if the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Sec. 300.321(b)(2) requires the public agency to take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.  However, the parties may agree to waive the resolution meeting or agree to use the mediation process.</span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that the IEP Team (defined 
in Sec.  300.23, which includes the child's parents) plays an important 
role in the special education decision-making process. For example, 
through the development, review and revision of the child's IEP, the 
IEP Team determines how to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability. However, the IEP Team does not have the authority to 
consent to the provision of special education and related services to a 
child. That authority is given exclusively to the parent under section 
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act. The Secretary strongly believes that a 
parent also has the authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending 
the provision of special education and related services to their child. 
Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of 
special education and related services at any time is consistent with 
the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's 
rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and 
choice in their child's education.

Discussion:  The commenter confuses the Act's prior written notice requirements with the requirements governing IEP Team meetings.  Section 300.503(a), consistent with section 615(b)(3) of the Act, requires prior written notice whenever a public agency proposes to initiate or change (or refuses to initiate or change) the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision of FAPE to a child.  A public agency meets the requirements in Sec. 300.503 so long as the prior written notice is provided a reasonable time before the public agency implements the proposal (or refusal) described in the notice.  A public agency is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting before it proposes a change in the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  The proposal, however, triggers the obligation to convene an IEP Team meeting.  Providing prior written notice in advance of meetings could suggest, in some circumstances, that the public agency's proposal was improperly arrived at before the meeting and without parent input.  Therefore, we are not changing Sec. 300.503 to require the prior written notice to be provided prior to an IEP Team meeting.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The requirement to conduct a meeting to develop a child's IEP within 30 days of the determination that a child needs special education and related services is longstanding, and has been included in the regulations since they were first issued in final form in 1977.  Experience has shown that many public agencies choose to conduct the meeting to develop the child's IEP well before the 30-day timeline.  Reducing the timeline to 15-days, as some commenters suggest, would be impractical, because there are situations when both public agencies and parents need additional time to ensure that appropriate individuals can be present at the meeting.  Experience has demonstrated that the 30-day timeline for conducting a meeting to develop an IEP is a reasonable time to provide both public agencies and parents the opportunity to ensure that required participants can be present at the IEP Team meeting.

Discussion:  These two provisions are not redundant.  Section 300.321(a)(7) requires the public agency to include the child with a disability, when appropriate (not "whenever possible," as stated by the commenter), in the child's IEP Team meeting, and, thus, provides discretion for the parent and the public agency to determine when it is appropriate to include the child in the IEP Team meeting.  Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.  The Department believes it is important for a child with a disability to participate in determining the child's postsecondary goals and for the IEP Team to consider the child's preferences and interests in determining those goals.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </span></dd>

We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.

Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.

<dd><span class="contentText">
To determine the impact of this change, it is necessary to estimate the savings created by providing fewer notices to parents who are notified about more than one IEP Team meeting during the year or who file more than one request for a due process hearing.  Given the small number of hearing requests in a year (about 20 per 10,000 children with disabilities), our analysis will focus on the number of parents involved in more than one IEP Team meeting.  Although we lack detailed data on the number of IEP Team meetings conducted each year, we estimate that approximately 6.947 million children with disabilities will be served in school year 2006-2007.  For the vast majority of these children, we believe there will be only one IEP Team meeting during the year.  For purposes of estimating an upper limit on savings, if we assume an average of 1.2 meetings per year per child, 1.39 million children will have two IEP Team meetings each year and the change reflected in Sec. 300.504(a) will result in 1.39 million fewer procedural notices provided to parents.  While some people may believe this change represents a significant reduction in paperwork for schools, the actual savings are likely to be minimal given the low cost of producing a notice of this size (about 10 pages) and the small amount of administrative staff time involved in providing this notice to parents (about 10 minutes).  Taking all of this into consideration, total savings are unlikely to exceed $5 million.</span></dd>

Discussion: The requirements recommended by the commenters are already addressed in these and other existing regulations. Section 300.160(a), consistent with section 612(a)(16) of the IDEA, requires each State to have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities in the State are included in State and district-wide assessments, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments where necessary. Section 300.320(a)(6), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI) of the IDEA, requires a child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, to include in the IEP any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child on State and district-wide assessments. If the IEP Team determines that a child will take an alternate assessment, the IEP Team must explain why the child cannot participate in the regular assessment and why the particular alternate assessment selected is appropriate for the child. Section 300.322(b) requires that the notice to the parent regarding an IEP Team meeting indicate the purpose of the meeting, in addition to the time and location of the meeting. Finally, new Sec.300.160(f) (proposed Sec.300.160(e)) requires that reports on the performance of children with disabilities on State and district-wide assessments be available to the public with the same frequency and in the same detail as reports on the assessment of nondisabled children.

Discussion:  The definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17 accurately reflects the specific language in section 602(9) of the Act.  We believe it is unnecessary to change the definition of FAPE in the manner recommended by the commenters because providing services in conformity with a child's IEP in the LRE is implicit in the definition of FAPE.  Consistent with Sec. 300.17(b), FAPE means that special education and related services must meet the standards of the SEA and the requirements in Part B of the Act, which include the LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118.  Additionally, Sec. 300.17(d) provides that FAPE means that special education and related services are provided in conformity with an IEP that meets the requirements in section 614(d) of the Act.  Consistent with section 614(d)(1)(i)(V) of the Act, the IEP must include a statement of the extent, if any, to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in the regular education class.  </span></dd>

Therefore, we decline to make the changes recommended by the commenters.  However, it should be noted that if a public agency wishes to invite officials from another agency, such as officials of the child welfare agency that are not representing the child, the public agency must obtain parental consent for the individual to participate in the IEP Team meeting because confidential information about the child from the child's education records would be shared at the meeting.  </span></dd>

Public agencies will realize savings from the change to the extent that they will not have to continue to contact agencies that declined to participate in IEP Team meetings on transition planning.  In school year 2006-2007, we project that public agencies will conduct 1.193 million meetings for children with disabilities who are 16 through 21 years old.  We used data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) on school contacts of outside agency personnel to project the number of instances in which outside agencies would be invited to IEP Team meetings during the 2006-2007 school year.  Based on these data, we project that schools will invite 1.492 million personnel from other agencies to IEP Team meetings for these students during the 2006-2007 school year.  The NLTS2 also collected data on the percentage of children with a transition plan for whom outside agency staff were actively involved in transition planning.

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act precludes the Department from interpreting section 614 of the Act to require public agencies to include information in a child's IEP other than what is explicitly required in the Act.  Therefore, we cannot require the IEP to include the statement requested by the commenters.  However, a child's social or cultural background is one of many factors that a public agency must consider in interpreting evaluation data to determine if a child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8 and the educational needs of the child, consistent with Sec. 300.306(c)(1)(i).</span></dd>

	With regard to the alignment of the IEP with the State's content standards, Sec. 300.320(a)(1)(i) clarifies that the general education curriculum means the same curriculum as all other children.  Therefore, an IEP that focuses on ensuring that the child is involved in the general education curriculum will necessarily be aligned with the State's content standards.  Congress acknowledged, in section 601(c)(5)(A) of the Act, that ensuring access to the general education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible, is also effective in preparing children with disabilities to lead productive and independent adult lives.  We do not believe further clarification is necessary to address the commenters' concerns.</span></dd>

Although not included in the Act, we believe it is important to retain this provision in these regulations so that there is no question that parent counseling and training includes helping parents acquire skills that will help them support the implementation of their child's IEP or IFSP. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
A State's role in this regard is thus twofold--it must ensure that children with disabilities are included in the assessments and that the accommodations that are offered to individual children with disabilities are ones that allow a child's academic achievement to be measured. This carries with it, we believe, a responsibility for each State to clearly identify for IEP Teams those accommodations that, if used, will not result in an invalid score, so that children with disabilities will be appropriately included in assessments. Therefore, as noted earlier, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(i) to require State and LEA guidelines to identify the accommodations for each assessment that do not result in invalid scores. We also believe that, to meet its responsibility to ensure that children with disabilities are included in assessments, a State needs to instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores. The child's IEP Team, though, remains the primary decisionmaker for the accommodations that will be made available to the child. Therefore, we have changed Sec.  300.160(b)(2)(ii) to make clear that State and LEA guidelines must instruct IEP Teams to select only accommodations that do not result in invalid scores.

Discussion:  We believe the regulations place great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum.  New Sec. 300.39(b)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(3)) defines specially designed instruction as adapting the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of the child and to ensure access to the general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.  In addition, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general curriculum is a major focus of the requirements for developing a child's IEP.  For example, Sec. 300.320(a)(1) requires a child's IEP to include a statement of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i) requires annual IEP goals to be designed to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services the child will receive, as well as the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided, to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of social work services in schools includes examples of the types of social work services that may be provided.  It is not a prescriptive or exhaustive list.  The child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether a child needs social work services, and what specific social work services are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is necessary to include functional behavioral assessments in the definition of social work services in schools because providing positive behavioral intervention strategies is just an example of a social work service that might be provided to a child if the child's IEP Team determines that such services are needed for the child to receive FAPE.  Similarly, if a child's IEP Team determines that mobilizing community resources would not be an effective means of enabling the child to learn as effectively as possible because there are no community resources to address the needs of the child, the IEP Team would need to consider other ways to meet the child's needs.  While there is the possibility that a due process hearing might be filed based on a failure to mobilize community resources that do not exist, we do not believe that such a claim could ever be successful, as the regulation does not require the creation of community resources that do not exist.</span></dd>

It is, however, important to ensure that parents have the information they need to participate meaningfully in IEP Team meetings, which may include reviewing their child's records.  Section 300.613(a) requires a public agency to comply with a parent request to inspect and review existing education records, including an evaluation report, without unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IEP, and in no case more than 45 days after the request has been made.

Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.

Discussion:  Section 614(d)(3)(B) of the Act does not include consideration of children with degenerative conditions as a special factor.

As with any child with a disability, the child's IEP Team, which includes the parent, determines the special education and related services that are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  For children with degenerative diseases, this may include related services such as physical and occupational therapy (or other services to address the child's needs in the areas of self-help, mobility, and communication) to help maintain the child's present levels of functioning for as long as possible in order for the child to benefit from special education.  In addition, as part of an evaluation or reevaluation, Sec. 300.305 requires the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, to review existing evaluation data on the child to determine the child's needs, which may include evaluations and information from parents, as well as medical professionals who know the child and the child's specific medical condition.</span></dd>

In addition, as noted in the discussion of Sec. 300.304(c)(5), we believe that it is important to include language stating that the requirements in Sec. 300.323 are applicable to children with disabilities who have an IEP in effect in a previous public agency and who transfer to a new school within the same "school year," rather than the same "academic year," because "school year" is the term most commonly understood by parents and school officials.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenter.

We, therefore, believe Sec. 300.530(d)(1) should be amended to be consistent with the Act by adding the reference to the FAPE requirements in Sec. 300.101(a), and to ensure it is understood that the educational services provided to a child removed for disciplinary reasons are consistent with the FAPE requirements in section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  </span></dd>

In fact, the Act emphasizes a proactive approach to behaviors that interfere with learning by requiring that, for children with disabilities whose behavior impedes their learning or that of others, the IEP Team consider, as appropriate, and address in the child's IEP, "the use of positive behavioral interventions, and other strategies to address the behavior."

In general, though, because removals under Sec. Sec. 300.530(g) and 300.532 will be for periods of time up to 45 days, care must be taken to ensure that if home instruction is provided for a child removed under Sec. 300.530, the services that are provided will satisfy the requirements for services for a removal under Sec. 300.530(d) and section 615(k)(1)(D) of the Act.

Therefore, we will clarify in Sec. 300.117 that each public agency must ensure that children with disabilities have the supplementary aids and services determined necessary by the child's IEP Team for the child to participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that child.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We agree with the commenter.  Section 300.107(a), as proposed, requires public agencies to take steps to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in a manner necessary to afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in those services and activities.  In addition, Sec. 300.320(a)(4)(ii), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(i)(IV)(bb) of the Act, clarifies that an IEP must include a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child to participate in extracurricular and other nonacademic activities.  We will add language in Sec. 300.107(a) to clarify that the steps taken by public agencies to provide access to nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities include the provision of supplementary aids and services determined appropriate and necessary by the child's IEP Team.  </span></dd>

Comment:  Some commenters recommended removing the term "special transportation" from the definition of transportation because the term gives the impression that adapted buses are used for a separate and different transportation system, when, in fact, adapted buses are part of the regular transportation fleet and system.  These commenters stated that adapted buses should only be used as a separate, special transportation service if the child's IEP indicates that the transportation needs of the child can be met only with transportation services that are separate from the transportation services for all children.</span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a 
child in a private school when FAPE is at issue does not constitute a

concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by 
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.  
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when 
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a 
disagreement between the parent and public agency about the provision 
of FAPE, do not constitute parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services.

Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.531, consistent with section 615(k)(2) of the Act, provides that the IEP Team determines the interim alternative educational setting for removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Additionally, section 615(k)(4)(A) of the Act is clear that, during an appeal under section 615(k)(3) of the Act, the child must remain in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action expires, whichever comes first, unless the parent and the LEA agree otherwise.  Thus, under the Act, whenever a hearing is requested under section 615(k)(3) of the Act by the parent or the LEA, it is the parties involved in the hearing (i.e., the parent and the LEA), not the IEP Team, that may agree to change the time period of the removal or the interim setting for the child.  We, therefore, do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to regulate as suggested by the commenter.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We are not changing the regulations because, in light of the Department's longstanding position that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of disciplinary removals that constitute a pattern, we believe requiring the public agency to carefully review the child's previous behaviors to determine whether the behaviors, taken cumulatively, are substantially similar is an important step in determining whether a series of removals of a child constitutes a change in placement, and is necessary to ensure that public agencies appropriately apply the change in placement provisions.  Whether the behavior in the incidents that resulted in the series of removals is "substantially similar" should be made on a case-by-case basis and include consideration of any relevant information regarding the child's behaviors, including, where appropriate, any information in the child's IEP.  However, we do not believe it is appropriate to require in these regulations that the "substantially similar behaviors" be recognized by the IEP Team or included in the child's IEP as recommended by the commenter.  The commenter is correct that what constitutes "substantially similar behavior" is a subjective determination.  However, we believe that when the child's behaviors, taken cumulatively, are objectively reviewed in the context of all the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for determining whether the series of behaviors constitutes a change in placement, the public agency will be able to make a reasonable determination as to whether a change in placement has occurred.  Of course, if the parent disagrees with the determination by the public agency, the parent may request a due process hearing pursuant to Sec. 300.532.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters recommended that Sec. 300.322(d) retain paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) in current Sec. 300.345, which provide examples of the types of records a public agency may keep to document its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed upon time and place for an IEP Team meeting.  These examples include detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses received; and detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits.  A few commenters stated that removing these provisions violates section 607(b) of the Act.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Under Sec. 300.323(f)(1), if the new public agency determines that an evaluation of the child is necessary to determine whether the child is a child with a disability under the new public agency's criteria, the new public agency must conduct the evaluation.  Until the evaluation is conducted, Sec. 300.323(f) requires the new public agency, in consultation with the parent, to provide the child with FAPE, including services comparable to those described in the IEP from the previous public agency.  The specific manner in which this is accomplished is best left to State and local officials and the parents to determine.  We do not believe that any further clarification is necessary.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We decline to make the suggested change.  We believe it would be overly burdensome to require a public agency to include all the notice requirements in Sec. 300.322(b) with an invitation to a child to attend his or her IEP Team meeting, particularly because the information is provided to the child's parents who can easily share this information with the child.  However, when a child with a disability reaches the age of majority under State law, the public agency must provide any notice required by the Act to both the child and the parents, consistent with Sec. 300.520 and section 615(m)(1)(A) of the Act. </span></dd>

Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive

general education student and will be considered a general education 
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after 
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State 
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general 
education student who has exited special education for accountability 
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to 
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores 
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the 
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the 
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for 
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a 
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related 
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating 
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the 
State may continue to include the child in the students with 
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two 
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no

Discussion: We agree that it is important for parents to be informed that their child will be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. We also believe that it is important that parents, as well as other IEP Team members, are informed about any effects of State or local policies on their student's education that may result from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards. As the commenters point out, this information is particularly important in a State where students must pass a particular assessment to be eligible to receive a regular high school diploma. Therefore, we have added a regulation requiring a State to provide IEP Teams, which include the parent, with a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify a student for a regular high school diploma). We also have required a State to ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based those standards. This also is consistent with Sec.200.1(f)(1)(iii) and (iv) of the Title I regulations.

Discussion:  Section 300.18(c)(2) requires that if a teacher (who is teaching exclusively to alternate achievement standards) is teaching students who need instruction above the elementary school level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to effectively teach to those standards.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that teachers exclusively teaching children who are assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards above the elementary level have sufficient subject matter knowledge to effectively instruct in each of the core academic subjects being taught, at the level of difficulty being taught.  For example, if a high school student (determined by the IEP Team to be assessed against alternate achievement standards) has knowledge and skills in math at the 7th grade level, but in all other areas functions at the elementary level, the teacher would need to have knowledge in 7th grade math in order to effectively teach the student to meet the 7th grade math standards.

Discussion:  The definition of core academic subjects does not vary for secondary students who are functioning significantly below grade level.  The Act focuses on high academic standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities that are consistent with the standards and expectations for all children.  As required in Sec. 300.320(a), each child's IEP must include annual goals to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum, and a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to enable the child to be involved and make progress in the general education curriculum.

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device does not list specific devices, nor would it be practical or possible to include an exhaustive list of assistive technology devices.  Whether an augmentative communication device, playback devices, or other devices could be considered an assistive technology device for a child depends on whether the device is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability, and whether the child's individualized education program (IEP) Team determines that the child needs the device in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).  However, medical devices that are surgically implanted, including those used for breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions, are excluded from the definition of an assistive technology device in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.

Section 300.306(a)(1) and section 614(b)(4)(A) of the Act require that a group of qualified professionals and the parent determine whether the child is a child with a disability.

Discussion: If a parent who revoked consent for special education

enrolled in special education, an LEA must treat this request as a 
request for an initial evaluation under Sec.  300.301 (rather than a 
reevaluation under Sec.  300.303). However, depending on the data 
available, a new evaluation may not always be required. An initial 
evaluation, under Sec.  300.305, requires a review of existing 
evaluation data that includes classroom based, local, or State 
assessments, and classroom based observations by teachers and related 
services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the 
child's parents, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine whether 
the child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec.  300.8, and 
the educational needs of the child. Therefore, a public agency may not 
always have to expend resources on a ``new'' initial evaluation.

Comment: Some commenters, including parents, teachers, and State 
educational agencies (SEAs), supported the requirements in proposed 
Sec.  300.300(b)(4) that would allow a parent of a child receiving 
special education and related services to revoke consent for those 
services. Commenters stated that if a parent has the right to initially 
consent to special education and related services, the parent also 
should have the right to revoke consent for special education and 
related services, particularly given that the plain language in Sec.  
300.9(c)(1) states that consent may be revoked at any time. Other 
commenters stated that parents are the ultimate experts on their 
children and have a fundamental right to direct their education. One 
commenter stated that schools should not have the right to force 
evaluations or services on a child through legal processes. Another 
commenter stated that a student should have every right to attempt to 
become independent and take responsibility for his or her academic 
achievement, without the assistance of an individualized education 
program (IEP).

We recognize that the statute uses both "reasonable measures" and "reasonable efforts" when referring to a public agency's responsibility to obtain parental consent for an evaluation, initial services, and a reevaluation.

Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec.

Comment: A few commenters acknowledged that there are some areas of 
noncompliance that can be corrected within one year of identification; 
however, the commenters expressed concern that the one-year timeline is 
not realistic for findings of systemic noncompliance in substantive 
areas such as the provision of FAPE, placement in the least restrictive 
environment (LRE), and child find. Other commenters requested that 
proposed Sec.  300.600(e) be revised to reflect ``degrees'' of 
noncompliance. For example, one commenter suggested that some instances 
of noncompliance (e.g., those related to a specific child's IEP 
implementation) should not take one year to correct; whereas instances 
of noncompliance related to systemic issues may take longer than one 
year to correct. The commenter also questioned how proposed Sec.  
300.600(e) will address situations involving longstanding 
noncompliance. Lastly, one commenter agreed with the intent of proposed 
Sec.  300.600(e) but requested that the timeline be modified to allow 
for exceptions, such as allowing a State to initiate appropriate action 
to correct noncompliance within one year of identification or as soon 
as possible thereafter.

We decline to amend the regulations to distinguish between or 
stratify types of noncompliance. Any noncompliance with the provisions 
in 34 CFR Part 300 is subject to the provisions in Sec.  300.600(e), 
and, therefore, must be corrected as soon as possible, and in no case 
later than one year from identification. However, we do agree with the 
commenter who suggested that some instances of noncompliance, e.g., 
those related to child-specific IEP timelines, may be corrected far 
more quickly than one year from identification. We expect that all 
noncompliance in those instances will be corrected as soon as possible. 
We recognize, though, that not all noncompliance can be corrected 
immediately. In our more than 30 year experience in implementing Part B 
of the Act, we have found that one year is a reasonable outside time 
limit for States for correcting noncompliance.

	However, despite the recognition that officials of participating agencies need access to records of children with disabilities to carry out the requirements of this part, there are important privacy concerns that we feel need to be protected in certain specified situations.

Representatives of these agencies, generally, are invited to participate in a child's IEP meeting because they may be providing or paying for transition services.  We do not believe that the representatives of these agencies should have access to all the child's records unless the parent (or the child who has reached the age of majority) gives consent for the disclosure.

With regard to the recommendation that a State focus on universally designed assessments, new Sec.  300.160(g) (proposed Sec.  300.160(f)) already incorporates the requirement in section 612(a)(16)(E) of the IDEA that a State, in the case of Statewide assessments, and an LEA, in the case of district-wide assessments, to the extent possible, use universal design in developing and implementing assessments. Moreover, Sec.  200.2(b)(2) of the Title I regulations requires a State's assessment system to ``[b]e designed to be valid and accessible for use by the widest possible range of students, including students with disabilities.''

Therefore, we do not believe that further clarification is necessary.  We also do not believe that it is necessary to add travel training to the definition of transition services, as recommended by the commenters.  We believe that IEP Teams already consider the importance of transportation and travel training services in the course of planning for a student's postsecondary transition needs.

Comment:  We received a number of comments regarding the phrase, "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c).

Many commenters requested removing the phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise," because it is not included in section 612(a)(5) of the Act and is not necessary to clarify that a parent may place his or her child in a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE requirements.

Discussion:  Section 300.110, consistent with section 612(a)(2) of the Act, requires States to ensure that public agencies take steps to ensure that children with disabilities have access to the same program options that are available to nondisabled children in the area served by the agency.  This would apply to dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings.  Therefore, a State would be responsible for ensuring that a public agency that offered dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings to a nondisabled student would have that option available to a student with disabilities whose IEP Team determined that such a program would best meet the student's needs.  However, we do not believe that the Act requires public agencies to provide dual enrollment programs in post-secondary or community-based settings for students with disabilities, if such programs are not available to nondisabled secondary school students.

Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </span></dd>

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of 
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under 
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for 
services under Part B of the Act.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.  The Act is clear that the public agency must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately participate in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Published estimates of the cost of multidisciplinary evaluations range from $500 to $2,500, but these estimates may overestimate potential savings because testing is a significant factor in the cost of evaluations, and districts are already permitted to dispense with additional testing when extant data are sufficient for reevaluation.  The extent to which States and districts eliminated unnecessary testing during triennial evaluations under the previous regulations is unclear, but program officers estimate that additional testing or observation by a school psychologist is not needed for as many as half of the approximately 1.7 million children eligible for triennial evaluations each year.  In the estimated 850,000 cases in which additional testing is not needed, review of the extant data may still be warranted to determine if a child still needs special education and related services under the Act or to assess whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services being provided are needed to help the child meet the child's IEP goals.  Even if additions or modifications to special education and related services are not likely, parents may not want to dispense with the triennial evaluation if they believe further information could be gained from the extant data or they want to compare their child's progress against his or her previous assessments.  If parents and the district agree that a reevaluation is not needed in 15 percent, or 127,500, of these cases and a reevaluation using only extant data would have cost $150, the final regulations could save $19.125 million. </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Because of the high cost of due process hearings and the low expected cost of conducting a resolution meeting, there would likely be some savings for all parties involved if resolution meetings were relatively successful in resolving disagreements.  For example, California reports an average cost of $18,600 for a due process hearing, while Texas reports having spent an average of $9,000 for a hearing officer's services.  Anticipating that attorneys will participate in approximately 40 percent of the predicted 3,985 resolution meetings (including drafting legally binding agreements when parties reach agreement), we expect resolution meetings to cost just over twice the average cost of IEP Team meetings, or approximately $700 per meeting.  Even with a very low success rate (eight percent), given the expected costs of these meetings compared to the high cost of conducting a hearing, all parties involved would likely realize some modest savings.  However, because disputes that result in formal hearings tend to be the most difficult to resolve, we do not expect that mandatory resolution meetings will be highly successful in resolving such cases.  By definition, these are cases in which the parties are not amenable to using existing alternatives to formal hearings such as mediation.  Moreover, assuming an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000 per due process hearing, even if as many as 20 percent of the 3,985 complaints were successfully resolved through resolution meetings, net savings still would not exceed $10 million.  (Note that it is unclear to what extent data on average mediation and due process hearing costs account for LEA opportunity costs (e.g., cost per teacher and/or administrator participating).  To the extent that these data do not reflect the opportunity costs of participating LEA officials and staff, we have overestimated the potential savings from resolution meetings). </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </span></dd>

The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.  (See Roncker v. Walter, 700 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 1983); Devries v. Fairfax County School Bd., 882 F.2d 876, 879 (4th Cir. 1989); Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1989); and A.W. v. Northwest R-1 School Dist., 813 F.2d 158, 163 (8th Cir. 1987).)</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</span></dd>
