Discussion:  As noted in the discussion responding to the previous comment, the list of Indian entities recognized as eligible to receive services from the United States is published in the Federal Register, pursuant to Section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a-1.  The Federal government does not maintain a list of other State Indian tribes.  Including State Indian tribes that are not federally recognized in the definition does not affect who is responsible under the Act for the provision of services to children with disabilities who are members of State Indian tribes.  Under section 611(h)(1) of the Act, the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for providing special education and related services to children age 5 through 21 with disabilities on reservations who are enrolled in elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.  With respect to all other children aged 3 through 21 on reservations, the SEA of the State in which the reservation is located is responsible for ensuring that all the requirements of Part B of the Act are implemented.</span></dd>

	Under Sec. 300.323(b), when an IFSP is used in lieu of an IEP, the child continues to receive FAPE.  This would not be the case under section 635(c) of the Act.  Under section 635(c) of the Act, parents of children with disabilities who are eligible for preschool services under section 619 of the Act and previously received early intervention services under Part C of the Act, may choose to continue early intervention services until the child enters, or is eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten.  The option to continue early intervention services is available only in States where the lead agency under Part C of the Act and the SEA have developed and implemented a State policy to provide this option.  This option will be detailed in the Part C regulations, and not the Part B regulations, as it permits a continuation of eligibility and coverage under Part C of the Act, rather than FAPE under Part B of the Act.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The programs under Parts B and C of the Act differ in their scope, eligibility, and the services available.  Services under Part B of the Act are generally provided in a school setting.  By contrast, services under Part C of the Act are provided, to the maximum extent appropriate, in the natural environment, which is often the infant or toddler's home or other community program designed for typically developing infants or toddlers.  The Department has long interpreted the current educational placement language in the stay-put provisions in section 615(j) of the Act and Sec. 300.518(a) as referring only to the child's placement under Part B of the Act and not to the early intervention services received by the child under Part C of the Act.  We believe that a child who previously received services under Part C of the Act, but has turned three and is no longer eligible under Part C of the Act, and is applying for initial services under Part B of the Act, does not have a "current educational placement."  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.704(f) adopts the requirements of, and is consistent with, section 611(e)(7) of the Act.  Under section 611(e)(7) of the Act, funds that are available under Sec. Sec. 300.704(a)(1), 300.705(c), and 300.814(e) may be used to develop and implement a State policy to provide services under Part C of the Act to children beyond the age of three.  The provisions that authorize such programs are reflected in Part C of the Act, predominantly in section 635(c) of the Act, which contains specific notice and consent requirements.  The notice of proposed rulemaking for Part C of the Act will address the notice, consent, and other requirements that apply to State lead agencies that elect to offer services to children with disabilities and their families beyond the age of three under section 635(c) of the Act.  The public will have a separate opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations for Part C of the Act when they are published in the Federal Register.

Discussion:  It is not necessary to list the specific personnel who provide services to children with disabilities under the Act and to whom the requirements in Sec. 300.156 apply because the regulations are sufficiently clear that all needed personnel are covered.  This includes personnel who provide travel instruction or therapeutic recreation services; teachers of children with visual impairments, if such personnel are necessary to carry out the purposes of this part; and preschool teachers in States where preschool teachers are considered elementary school teachers.  Section 300.156(a), consistent with section 612(a)(14)(A) of the Act, requires each SEA to establish and maintain personnel qualification requirements to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act and part 300 are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  </span></dd>

The Act does not otherwise specify the information that must be included in the summary and we do not believe that the regulations should include a list of required information.  Rather, we believe that State and local officials should have the flexibility to determine the appropriate content in a child's summary, based on the child's individual needs and postsecondary goals.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.702, consistent with section 611(c) of the Act, allows the Secretary to reserve funds under Part B of the Act to support technical assistance activities authorized in section 616(i) of the Act.  Under section 642 of the Act, section 616 applies to the early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities under Part C of the Act.  Section 616(i) of the Act requires the Secretary to review the data collection and analysis capacity of States to ensure that data and information necessary for monitoring the implementation of Parts B and C of the Act are collected, analyzed, and accurately reported to the Secretary, and to provide technical assistance, as needed.  Therefore the technical assistance referred to in Sec. 300.702 can be provided to both SEAs and lead agencies under Part C of the Act.</span></dd>

Section 300.520 provides additional information about the transfer of rights as part of the procedural safeguards for parents and children under the Act.  </span></dd>

For services that are not necessary to provide access to education by maintaining the health or safety of the child while in school, the distinguishing factor between those services that are not covered under the Act, such as mapping, and those that are covered, such as verifying that a cochlear implant is functioning properly, in large measure, is the level of expertise required.  The maintenance and monitoring of surgically implanted devices require the expertise of a licensed physician or an individual with specialized technical expertise beyond that typically available from school personnel.  On the other hand, trained lay persons or nurses can routinely check an externally worn processor connected with a surgically implanted device to determine if the batteries are charged and the external processor is operating.  (As discussed below, the Act does require public agencies to provide those services that are otherwise related services and are necessary to maintain a child's health or safety in school even if those services require specialized training.)  Teachers and related services providers can be taught to first check the externally worn speech processor to make sure it is turned on, the volume and sensitivity settings are correct, and the cable is connected, in much the same manner as they are taught to make sure a hearing aid is properly functioning.  To allow a child to sit in a classroom when the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant is not functioning is to effectively exclude the child from receiving an appropriate education.  Therefore, we believe it is important to clarify that a public agency is responsible for the routine checking of the external components of a surgically implanted device in much the same manner as a public agency is responsible for the proper functioning of hearing aids.</span></dd>

The list provides public agencies with examples of services and activities that may afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in the services offered to other children of the public agency.  We disagree that the list of activities causes confusion with related services, as we think that the public can easily recognize the difference between academic counseling services, for example, that are offered to all children, and the type of counseling services that might be included in a child's IEP as a related service.  For these reasons, we believe it is appropriate to maintain the list of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in Sec. 300.107, including those services that are also related services in Sec. 300.34. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to retain in the regulations the requirements in current Sec. Sec. 300.280 through 300.284 because the provisions in Sec. 300.165 and GEPA, in 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(7), provide sufficient opportunities for public participation.  We also believe retaining the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.280 through 300.284 would place unnecessary regulatory burden on States.  Section 300.165(a) incorporates the language in section 612(a)(19) of the Act, regarding public participation in the adoption of policies and procedures to implement Part B of the Act, and requires States to ensure that there are public hearings, adequate notice of hearings, and an opportunity for comment available to the general public.  Furthermore, paragraph (b) of this section requires States to comply with the public participation requirements of GEPA, in 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(7), before submitting a State plan under this part.  In accordance with the GEPA requirement, the State must assure that it will provide reasonable opportunities for participation by local agencies, representatives of the class of individuals affected by programs under this part and other interested institutions, organizations, and individuals in the planning for the operation of programs under this part.  GEPA also requires that the State publish each proposed State plan under this part, in a manner that will ensure circulation throughout the State, at least 60 days prior to the date on which the State plan is submitted to the Secretary or on which the State plan becomes effective, whichever occurs earlier, with an opportunity for public comments on such plan to be accepted for at least 30 days.

Therefore, the opportunity for a parent and the public agency to agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary occurs before a reevaluation begins.  It would be inconsistent with the Act to implement the commenters' recommendation.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.30(b)(2) specifically states that if a judicial decree or order identifies a person or persons to act as the parent of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child, then that person would be determined to be the parent.  It was intended to add clarity about who would be designated a parent when there are competing individuals under Sec. 300.30(a)(1) through (4) who could be considered a parent for purposes of this part.  It is not necessary to specify or limit this language to provide that the judicial decree or order applies to specific situations, such as divorce or custody cases.  However, it should not authorize courts to appoint individuals other than those identified in Sec. 300.30(a)(1) through (4) to act as parents under this part.  Specific authority for court appointment of individuals to provide consent for initial evaluations in limited circumstances is in Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(c).

Early intervention services, on the other hand, are services for children birth through age two that are designed to meet the developmental needs of infants and toddlers with disabilities under section 632 in Part C of the Act.  Section 632(5)(A) of the Act defines infant or toddler with a disability as a child under the age of three years who (a) is experiencing developmental delays in one or more of the areas of cognitive development, physical development, communication development, social or emotional development, and adaptive development, or (b) has a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay.  In addition, some States also provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers who are at risk of having a developmental delay.

Discussion:  As noted in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section for subpart B, Sec. 300.152(c)(1) has been amended to require that States set aside any part of a State complaint filed under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 that is being addressed in a due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, and resolve any issue that is not a part of the due process hearing decision within the 60-day timeline for State complaints (unless the timeline is extended, consistent with Sec. 300.152(b)).  This change was made to address those limited occasions when a parent files both a State complaint and a due process hearing on the same or similar issues.  While the Department does not encourage the dual filing of complaints, we are aware that this occasionally occurs and it is important for the regulations to be clear as to how such situations should be handled.  In light of this change, we are amending the requirement in Sec. 300.504(c)(5), regarding the contents of the procedural safeguards notice, to inform parents of the opportunity to present and resolve complaints through the due process complaint and the State complaint procedures.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to change the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenter.  Section 300.124, consistent with section 612(a)(9) of the Act, already requires States to have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that children transitioning from an early intervention program under Part C of the Act to a preschool program under Part B of the Act experience a smooth and effective transition to those preschool programs.  In addition, each LEA is required to participate in transition planning conferences with the lead agency responsible for providing early intervention services and to have an IEP (or an IFSP, if consistent with Sec. 300.323(b) and section 636(d) of the Act) for the child developed and implemented by the child's third birthday.  We believe that in the course of the transition planning conferences and developing the child's IEP, there would be many opportunities for discussions regarding the services provided under Parts B and C of the Act.  </span></dd>

A few commenters expressed concern that if issues in a State complaint, which are not part of a due process complaint, are not investigated until the due process complaint is resolved, children may go without FAPE for extended periods of time.  These commenters also stated that parents are likely to file for due process on every issue of concern, rather than using the more expeditious and less expensive State complaint procedures.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The link between reductions in local maintenance of effort (reflected in Sec. 300.205(d)) and the amount of Part B funds that LEAs may use to provide early intervening services (reflected in Sec. 300.226) is established in the Act.

Section 300.205(d) states that the amount of funds expended by an LEA for early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 counts toward the maximum amount of expenditures that an LEA may reduce in its local maintenance of effort.  Section 300.226(a) clearly states that the amount of Part B funds an LEA may use to provide early intervening services may not exceed 15 percent of the funds the LEA receives under Part B of the Act less any amount reduced by the LEA under Sec. 300.205. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The language requested by the commenter is not necessary because section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act already provides for situations in which a parent refuses consent for initial services and the child subsequently engages in behavior that violates a code of student conduct.  Section 300.534(c)(1), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, provides that a public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311, or has refused services under this part.

Discussion:  Override of parental refusal to consent to a reevaluation is already addressed in the regulations.  Section 300.300(c) states that each public agency must obtain informed parental consent in accordance with Sec. 300.300(a)(1) prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability.  Section 300.300(a)(3) allows a public agency to override parental refusal to consent to an initial evaluation by utilizing the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516.  The cross-reference in Sec. 300.300(c)(1)(i) to the provision in Sec. 300.300(a)(1) provides the basis for allowing a public agency to override the parent's refusal of consent to a reevaluation.  However, we believe it is important to state this more directly and will, therefore, add language to Sec. 300.300(c)(1) to clarify that if a parent refuses to consent to a reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part.</span></dd>

We added a new paragraph (b)(2) to clarify that parental consent is required for the disclosure of information to participating agencies that likely may provide or pay for transition services.

Discussion:  Section 300.530(e)(1), which tracks section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, requires a review of all relevant information in the child's file, including the child's IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents.  We believe this clearly conveys that the list of relevant information in paragraph (e)(1) of the section is not exhaustive and may include other relevant information in the child's file, such as the information mentioned by the commenters.  It would be impractical to list all the possible relevant information that may be in a child's file and, therefore, it is not necessary to further regulate on this matter.  </span></dd>

Discussion: Proposed Sec.  300.9(c)(3) specifies that if a parent 
revokes consent for the child's receipt of special education and 
related services, the public agency is not required to remove any 
references to the child's receipt of special education and related 
services because of the parent's revocation of consent. This provision 
does not affect the rights provided to parents in Sec. Sec.  300.618 
through 300.621, including the opportunity to request amendments to 
information in education records that is inaccurate or misleading, or 
violates the privacy or other rights of a child. Additionally, proposed 
Sec.  300.9(c)(3) does not affect a public agency's responsibilities 
under Sec.  300.613, concerning a parent's right to inspect and review 
any education records relating to his or her children that are 
collected, maintained, or used by the agency under Part B of the Act, 
or Sec.  300.624, requiring a public agency to (a) inform parents when 
personally identifiable information collected, maintained, or used 
under Part B of the Act is no longer needed to provide educational 
services to the child, and (b) destroy, at the request of the parent, 
such information. Given the protections available to parents to monitor 
the information in education records, to amend records, to be notified 
if the public agency intends to destroy information in education 
records, and to ultimately have the records destroyed, adding a rule of 
construction to Sec.  300.9(c)(3), as requested by the commenter, is 
not necessary.

In addition, a parent always has the right to file a due process complaint and request a due process hearing on any matter concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of his or her child, or the provision of FAPE and may seek to resolve their disputes through mediation.  It is important to clarify that when the parent files both a due process complaint and a State complaint on the same issue, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.  However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the State complaint procedures in Sec. 300.152, including using the time limit and procedures in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 300.152.  (See Sec. 300.152(c)(1)).  Under the Act, the decision reached through the due process proceedings is the final decision on those matters, unless a party to the hearing appeals that decision by requesting State-level review, if applicable, or by bringing a civil action in an appropriate State or Federal court.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </span></dd>

that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred. However, Sec.  
300.534(c)(1)(ii) states that a public agency is not deemed to have

parent revokes consent for special education and related services under 
Sec.  300.300(b), the parent has refused services as described in Sec.

Models based on RTI typically evaluate the child's response to instruction prior to the onset of the 60-day period, and generally do not require as long a time to complete an evaluation because of the amount of data already collected on the child's achievement, including observation data.

evaluate a child before determining that the child is no longer a child

Discussion:  The observation requirements for children suspected of having SLD have been in the regulations since before 1983.  Important information can be obtained about a child through observation in the classroom, or for a child less than school age, in an environment appropriate for a child of that age.  Objective observations are essential to assessing a child's performance and should be a part of routine classroom instruction and are not costly or overly prescriptive.  We believe the observation requirements are an important matter to regulate clearly.  We will, therefore, change Sec. 300.310(a) through Sec. 300.310(c) to clearly state that the public agency must ensure appropriate observation and documentation of the child's academic performance and behavior in the areas of difficulty to determine whether a child has an SLD.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.172(a), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(A) of the Act, requires States to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner after the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  As noted in the discussion to the previous comment, the NIMAS is included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard and was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084).  The Department believes that States should make every effort to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner following the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register, recognizing that the timelines and requirements for adopting new rules, policies, or procedures vary from State to State.  States choosing to coordinate with the NIMAC must, consistent with section 612(a)(23)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.172(c) of these regulations, not later than December 3, 2006, as part of any print instructional materials adoption process, procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the publisher of the print instructional materials to:  (1) require the publisher to prepare and, on or before delivery of the print instructional materials, provide the NIMAC with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the NIMAS; or (2) purchase instructional materials from the publisher that are produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.  Clearly, we would expect that these States would have adopted the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  We decline to require a specific adoption date for all States, however, given the lack of specificity in the Act.  We also decline to include a definition of "adopt" in these regulations because requirements for adopting new rules and policies may vary from State to State.  The Department's view is that it is inherent in the adoption requirement that, at a minimum, upon "adoption" of the NIMAS, a State must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  Under Sec. 300.172(a), adopting the NIMAS is a State responsibility and does not impose any legal obligations on publishers of instructional materials.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device does not list specific devices, nor would it be practical or possible to include an exhaustive list of assistive technology devices.  Whether an augmentative communication device, playback devices, or other devices could be considered an assistive technology device for a child depends on whether the device is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability, and whether the child's individualized education program (IEP) Team determines that the child needs the device in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).  However, medical devices that are surgically implanted, including those used for breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions, are excluded from the definition of an assistive technology device in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.

Discussion:  The identification of the effect of cultural factors on a child's performance is a judgment made by the eligibility group based on multiple sources of information, including the home environment, language proficiency, and other contextual factors gathered in the evaluation.  The Department believes that the identification of children with SLD will improve with models based on systematic assessments of a child's response to appropriate instruction, the results of which are one part of the information reviewed during the evaluation process to determine eligibility for special education and related services.  States and public agencies must follow the evaluation procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.304 and 300.305 and section 614(b) of the Act, including using assessments and other evaluation materials that do not discriminate on a racial or cultural basis, consistent with Sec. 300.304(c)(1)(i) and section 614(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The development of an IFSP for children from birth through age two is the responsibility of the designated lead agency responsible for early intervention programs under section 635(a)(10) in Part C of the Act.

However, if a child turns age three and an LEA and a parent agree to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, as allowed under section 614(d)(2)(B) of the Act, the LEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b) are met.  Therefore, if an IFSP was incorrectly developed by the early intervention agency and the public agency and the parent agree to use the IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the LEA is responsible for modifying the IFSP so that it meets the requirements in Sec. 300.323(b).  </span></dd>

	In addition, clarity will be improved by changing certain terms to align with terms that are more commonly used in this part.

In addition, as noted in the discussion of Sec. 300.304(c)(5), we believe that it is important to include language stating that the requirements in Sec. 300.323 are applicable to children with disabilities who have an IEP in effect in a previous public agency and who transfer to a new school within the same "school year," rather than the same "academic year," because "school year" is the term most commonly understood by parents and school officials.

Discussion:  The Act now makes the resolution process a prerequisite to an impartial due process hearing.  Under section 615(j) of the Act, a child must be maintained in the current educational placement while proceedings under the Act are pending, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 300.518 clarifies that unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current educational placement during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint under Sec. 300.507.  Thus, the Act is clear that the public agency must maintain the child's current educational placement during the pendency of the 30-day resolution process, which is triggered once the parent files a due process complaint under this part, regardless of whether the due process complaint is resolved prior to a due process hearing.  We believe it is important for this to be clear in the procedural safeguards notice.

Because the Act gives States the discretion to determine how to use these funds, so long as they are used in accordance with the requirements in Part B of the Act, the Department does not believe it would be appropriate to remove this discretion by regulation and require States to use these funds to provide technical assistance to particular types of facilities, as suggested by the commenter.</span></dd>

As part of the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.600 through 300.604, States must report annually on indicators in three monitoring priority areas.  One of the monitoring priority areas is disproportionality, for which there are two indicators.  In addition to annually reviewing State performance on each indicator in each monitoring priority area, the State must review each LEA against indicators established for each monitoring priority area, so the State will be examining data annually to identify any disproportionality.  If disproportionality is identified in LEAs, the policies, procedures, and practices of the LEAs will be examined to determine if they are leading to inappropriate identification, and, pursuant to section 618(d)(2)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.646(b)(3), the LEA will be required to report publicly on the revision of policies, practices, and procedures used in identification or placement.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to add a requirement that LEAs monitor the effect of early intervening services on disproportionality because the LEAS will have to continue to publicly report on their revision of policies, practices and procedures until the significant disproportionality in the LEA is eliminated.

Therefore, we will revise Sec. 300.154(d)(2)(iv) to clarify that parental consent is required each time the public agency seeks to use the parent's public insurance or other public benefits.

Discussion:  Section 300.131(c), consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(ii)(III) of the Act, requires that, in carrying out child find for parentally-placed private school children, SEAs and LEAs must undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for their publicly enrolled or publicly-placed children.  This would generally include, but is not limited to, such activities as widely distributing informational brochures, providing regular public service announcements, staffing exhibits at health fairs and other community activities, and creating direct liaisons with private schools.  Activities for child find must be completed in a time period comparable to those activities for public school children.  This means that LEAs must conduct child find activities, including individual evaluations, for parentally-placed private school children within a reasonable period of time and without undue delay, and may not wait until after child find for public school children is conducted.  In addition, evaluations of all children suspected of having disabilities under Part B of the Act, regardless of whether they are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools or secondary schools, must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311, consistent with section 614(a) through (c) of the Act, which describes the procedures for evaluations and reevaluations for all children with disabilities.  We believe the phrase "activities similar" is understood by SEAs and LEAs and, therefore, it is not necessary to regulate on the meaning of the phrase.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The list of acute or chronic health conditions in the definition of other health impairment is not exhaustive, but rather provides examples of problems that children have that could make them eligible for special education and related services under the category of other health impairment.  We decline to include dysphagia, FAS, bipolar disorders, and other organic neurological disorders in the definition of other health impairment because these conditions are commonly understood to be health impairments.  However, we do believe that Tourette syndrome is commonly misunderstood to be a behavioral or emotional condition, rather than a neurological condition.  Therefore, including Tourette syndrome in the definition of other health impairment may help correct the misperception of Tourette syndrome as a behavioral or conduct disorder and prevent the misdiagnosis of their needs.  </span></dd>

Several commenters noted that many children with hearing, visual, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; or emotional disturbances (ED) also have concomitant learning disabilities that go unidentified, and that these children end up with lower academic and functional achievement levels than they should because an important contributing factor to their learning problems has not been addressed.

Discussion:  Section 300.115 requires each public agency to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements (including instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions) is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services.  The list of placement options in this section only expands the settings mentioned in new Sec. 300.39 (proposed Sec. 300.38) by recognizing the various types of classrooms and settings for classrooms in which special education is provided.

Concerning the comments about written notice of the receipt of a 
parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue 
services and the comment concerning an opportunity to meet with the 
State's PTI center to receive additional information about the 
potential effect of the parent's decision, we have not adopted 
additional procedures for parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services because the regulations already provide 
sufficient notice protections to enable parents to understand the 
implications of the decision they are making. To clarify this point, we 
have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to specify that prior written 
notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 be provided to parents before a 
public agency discontinues special education and related services to 
their child. Public agencies, under Sec.  300.503, are required to give 
the parents of a child with a disability written notice that meets the 
requirements in Sec.  300.503(b) within a reasonable time before the 
public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the 
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or 
the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the 
child. Once a public agency receives a parent's written revocation of 
consent for a child's receipt of special education and related 
services, the public agency, under Sec.  300.503, must provide prior 
written notice to the parent regarding the change in educational 
placement and services that will result from the revocation of consent. 
The notice must include, among other matters, information on sources 
for the parents to contact that can assist the parents in understanding 
the requirements of Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations. 
Section 300.503(c)(1)(i) also requires that this prior notice be 
written in language understandable to the general public. It is 
imperative that the public agency provide the required prior notice in 
a meaningful manner. Accordingly, Sec.  300.503(c)(1)(ii) requires that 
any notice required by Sec.  300.503 must be provided in the native 
language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the 
parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. Additionally, if 
the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a 
written language, Sec.  300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to 
take additional measures to communicate the information contained in 
the notice. These measures involve taking steps to ensure that the 
notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in the 
parent's native language or other mode of communication, that the 
parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written 
evidence that the requirements of Sec.  300.503(c) have been met.

Comment:  We received numerous, specific requests to revise Sec. 300.168 to add to the list of individuals who can serve as members of the State advisory panels.  Some commenters recommended requiring State advisory panels to include representatives from the Parent Training and Information Centers and Community Parent Resource Centers funded by the Department under sections 671 and 672 of the Act because their representation would ensure a diverse group of people experienced with children with different disabilities on the panels.  One commenter expressed concern that, without representation from these groups, panel members would make recommendations based solely on their individual circumstances and backgrounds.  A few commenters requested including school psychologists and other student support staff on State advisory panels.  One commenter suggested including a representative of a residential treatment facility as a member on State advisory panels because children in these facilities are a growing population and have specialized needs.  A few commenters requested adding representatives from centers for independent living because these individuals are experienced in advocating for people with disabilities.  One commenter suggested including State coordinators for education of homeless children and youth.  A few commenters suggested including disabled high school and postsecondary students on the list because the intended beneficiaries of the Act are often denied a voice.  A few commenters proposed requiring each State advisory panel to be racially, culturally, linguistically, and socio-economically representative of the State.  One commenter expressed concern that the new regulations could lead States to abruptly replace current panel members causing discontinuity and decreasing expertise, and recommended phasing in the new requirements and allowing panel members to complete their terms of office. </span></dd>

Discussion: Certain provisions in the Part 300 regulations, such as 
the definition of parent in Sec.  300.30 and the requirements regarding 
surrogate parents in Sec.  300.519, ensure that a child with a 
disability has an individual who can act as a parent to make 
educational decisions on behalf of the child. Parent, as defined in 
Sec.  300.30, means a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a 
foster parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual 
obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from 
acting as a parent; a guardian generally authorized to act as the 
child's parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the 
child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); an 
individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent 
(including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the 
child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child's welfare. The definition of parent also 
includes a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with 
Sec.  300.519 and section 639(a)(5) of the Act. The duty to appoint a 
surrogate parent under Sec.  300.519 arises when no parent can be 
identified, the public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate 
a parent, the child is a ward of the State, or the child is an 
unaccompanied homeless youth, as defined in section 725(6) of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434(a)(6)).

It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.  Section 300.503 already requires prior written notice to be given to the parents of a child with a disability a reasonable time before the public agency proposes (or refuses) to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.503(c) and 300.504(d), the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, respectively, must be written in language understandable to the general public and provided in the native language or other mode of communication of the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the public agency must take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.</span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  It is important for public agencies to include an explanation of the State complaint procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 and the due process complaint procedures in Sec. 300.507 in the procedural safeguards notice to assist parents in understanding the differences between these procedures.  The reference to "jurisdictional issues" addresses the scope of the State complaint and due process complaint procedures.  An organization or individual may file a State complaint under Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153 alleging that a public agency has violated a requirement of the Act for a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date on which the complaint is received, unless one of the exceptions in Sec. 300.153(c) is applicable.  The Department's longstanding position is that a State must resolve any complaint, and may not remove from the jurisdiction of its State complaint procedures complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child simply because those issues also could be the subject of a due process complaint.  We view the State complaint procedures as a very important tool in a State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities, consistent with sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a) of the Act, to monitor LEA implementation of the requirements in Part B of the Act.  These responsibilities extend to both systemic and child-specific issues.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of interpreting services clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The nature and type of interpreting services required for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and also limited in English proficiency are to be determined by reference to the Department's regulations and policies regarding students with limited English proficiency.  For example, the Department's regulations in 34 CFR part 100, implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, require that recipients of Federal financial assistance ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by students who are limited English proficient, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The requirement to provide services to students who are limited English proficient and others is also governed by various Department policy memoranda including the September 27, 1991 memorandum, "Department of Education Policy Update on Schools' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students With Limited English Proficiency;" the December 3, 1985 guidance document, "The Office for Civil Rights' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures;" and the May 1970 memorandum to school districts, "Identification of discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin," 35 FR 11595.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Sections 300.530(g) through 300.532 incorporate two significant statutory changes relating to the authority of school personnel to remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings.  First, the Act now gives school personnel the authority to remove to interim alternative educational settings children who have inflicted serious bodily injury to themselves, or others.  Under previous law, school personnel were authorized to remove children to alternative settings only for misconduct involving: 1) the use and possession of weapons; and 2) the knowing possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The Act added the commission of serious bodily injury to this list.  In cases involving serious bodily injury, school personnel would be able to unilaterally remove children with disabilities to interim alternative educational settings for up to 45 school days without having to request that a hearing officer review the facts to determine whether or not the child is substantially likely to harm him or herself or others.  Second, the 45-day rule has changed.  Under previous law, students could not be removed to interim alternative educational settings for more than 45 days.  Now, under the Act, the comparable time limitation is 45 school days.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The removal of "due process" from the heading in current 300.528 does not represent a substantive change.  The change was made to track the statutory requirements in the Act.  However, we believe it is important to clarify that an expedited hearing under Sec. 300.532(c) is a due process hearing and the heading to paragraph (c) has been amended to retain the heading in current Sec. 300.528.  We also have made additional technical and clarifying changes to paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of Sec. 300.532.  In paragraph (c)(2) of this section, we are clarifying that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and restructuring the paragraph for clarity.  In paragraph (c)(3) of this section, we are clarifying that the meeting referenced in this paragraph is a resolution meeting.</span></dd>

Collection of Information:  Annual State Application under Part B of the Act.  Sec. Sec. 300.100 through 300.176, Sec. 300.182, and Sec. 300.804.  Each State is eligible for assistance under Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the State submits a plan that provides assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the State meets the eligibility criteria under Part B of the Act and these final regulations.  Under the Act, States are no longer required to have on file with the Secretary policies and procedures to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State meets specific conditions for assistance under Part B of the Act.  Information collection 1820-0030 has been revised to reflect this change in the Act and these regulations.</span></dd>

Furthermore, the State complaint procedures were a part of the initial Part B regulations in 1977 (45 CFR 121a.602).  These regulations were moved into part 76 of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in the early 1980s, and were returned to the Part B regulations in 1992 (after the Department decided to move the regulations out of EDGAR and place them in program regulations for the major formula grant programs).  Although the State complaint procedures have changed in some respects in the years since 1977, the basic right of any individual or organization to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of program requirements has remained the same.  For these reasons, we believe the State complaint procedures should be retained in the regulations.</span></dd>

Enforcement options available to the Secretary include, among others, recovery of funds or withholding, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under Part B of the Act.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of FAPE in Sec. 300.17 is taken directly from section 602(9) of the Act.  We believe the ESY requirements are appropriately included under the FAPE requirements as a part of a State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act because the right of an individual child with a disability to ESY services is based on a child's entitlement to FAPE.  As a part of the State's eligibility for assistance under Part B of the Act, the State must make FAPE available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandated age ranges.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  The purpose of the change in the law is to simplify the discipline process and make it easier for school officials to discipline children with disabilities when discipline is appropriate and justified.  </span></dd>

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The definition of social work services in schools includes examples of the types of social work services that may be provided.  It is not a prescriptive or exhaustive list.  The child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether a child needs social work services, and what specific social work services are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is necessary to include functional behavioral assessments in the definition of social work services in schools because providing positive behavioral intervention strategies is just an example of a social work service that might be provided to a child if the child's IEP Team determines that such services are needed for the child to receive FAPE.  Similarly, if a child's IEP Team determines that mobilizing community resources would not be an effective means of enabling the child to learn as effectively as possible because there are no community resources to address the needs of the child, the IEP Team would need to consider other ways to meet the child's needs.  While there is the possibility that a due process hearing might be filed based on a failure to mobilize community resources that do not exist, we do not believe that such a claim could ever be successful, as the regulation does not require the creation of community resources that do not exist.</span></dd>

Discussion: We appreciate the commenters' support for this 
provision. Concerning the recommendation that the substance of proposed 
Sec.300.9(c)(3) be placed in either Sec.Sec.300.618 or 300.624, we 
have included the provision in Sec.300.9 because the provision 
specifically relates to the definition of consent. Section 300.9(c) 
addresses revocation of consent, explaining that consent is voluntary 
and may be revoked at any time. Further, Sec.300.9(c) states that the 
parent's revocation of consent is not retroactive in that revocation 
does not negate an action that has occurred after the consent was given 
and before the consent was revoked. Proposed Sec.  300.9(c)(3) further 
defines the effect of a parent's revocation of consent on the content 
of his or her child's education records. A parent's revocation of 
consent is not retroactive; consequently, the public agency would not 
be required to amend the child's education records to remove any 
references to the child's receipt of special education and related 
services in the event the child's parent revokes consent. Therefore, we 
decline to follow the commenters' recommendation to remove Sec.  
300.9(c)(3) and include the content of this provision in either 
Sec. Sec.  300.618 or 300.624.

Section 612(a)(16)(A) of the IDEA and Sec.300.160(a) of these regulations require a state to ensure that all children with disabilities are included in general State and district-wide assessments.

Under Sec.Sec.200.1(e) and 200.6(a)(3) of the Title I regulations published in this notice and new Sec.300.160(c), a State has the option of developing alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards.

LEAs may not use their Part B funds to support the mediation process described in Sec. 300.506.  Consistent with section 615(e)(2)(D) of the Act, Sec. 300.506(b)(4) requires the State (not the LEA) to bear the cost of that mediation process.

Some LEAs (and States) offer alternative mediation processes, in addition to the mediation process required under section 615 of the Act.

Therefore, if an LEA has an alternative mediation process, it may use its Part B funds for this process, so long as parents are provided access to the required mediation process under section 615 of the Act and are not required to use an alternative mediation process in order to engage in the mediation process provided under section 615 of the Act. </span></dd>

Discussion: Section 300.705(a), consistent with section 611(f)(1) 
of the Act, requires each State to provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that have 
established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Section 
613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for assistance under 
Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits a plan that 
provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of the 
conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving children with 
disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. Requiring States 
to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will ensure that LEAs have Part B funds 
available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or to 
serve children with disabilities who subsequently enroll or are 
identified during the year. Regardless of the level of funding made 
available for the Part B program under the Act, neither the Act nor the 
implementing regulations require that Part B funds be spent only for 
direct services for students who are currently eligible for special 
education and related services. As in the past, LEAs may use Part B 
funds for direct services to children with disabilities or for other 
permissible activities, such as child find, professional development, 
and more recently, for coordinated early intervening services in 
accordance with Sec.  300.226.

We believe that an SEA, in resolving a complaint challenging the appropriateness of a child's educational program or services or the provision of FAPE, should not only determine whether the public agency has followed the required procedures to reach that determination, but also whether the public agency has reached a decision that is consistent with the requirements in Part B of the Act in light of the individual child's abilities and needs.  Thus, the SEA may need to review the evaluation data in the child's record, or any additional data provided by the parties to the complaint, and the explanation included in the public agency's notice to the parent as to why the agency made the determination regarding the child's educational program or services.  If necessary, the SEA may need to interview appropriate individuals, to determine whether the agency followed procedures and applied standards that are consistent with State standards, including the requirements of Part B of the Act, and whether the determination made by the public agency is consistent with those standards and supported by the data.  The SEA may, in its effort to resolve a complaint, determine that interviews with appropriate individuals are necessary for the SEA to obtain the relevant information needed to make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of Part B of the Act or of part 300.  However, such interviews conducted by the SEA, as part of its effort to resolve a State complaint, are not intended to be comparable to the requirement in section 615(h)(2) of the Act, which provides any party to a due process hearing the right to present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.</span></dd>

Whether a bus suspension would count as a day of suspension would depend on whether the bus transportation is a part of the child's IEP.  If the bus transportation were a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension would be treated as a suspension under Sec. 300.530 unless the public agency provides the bus service in some other way, because that transportation is necessary for the child to obtain access to the location where services will be delivered.  If the bus transportation is not a part of the child's IEP, a bus suspension is not a suspension under Sec. 300.530.  In those cases, the child and the child's parent have the same obligations to get the child to and from school as a nondisabled child who has been suspended from the bus.  However, public agencies should consider whether the behavior on the bus is similar to behavior in a classroom that is addressed in an IEP and whether the child's behavior on the bus should be addressed in the IEP or a behavioral intervention plan for the child.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We agree that Sec. 300.622 should be revised to more accurately reflect the Department's policies regarding when parental consent is or is not required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to officials of participating agencies, and other individuals and entities.  In some instances, current Sec. 300.571 (proposed Sec. 300.622) has been construed to prohibit disclosures without parental consent under this part that would be permitted without parental consent under FERPA.  Accordingly, when final regulations for this program were issued in 1999, we amended current Sec. 300.571(a) (proposed Sec. 300.622(a)) to clarify that the release of disciplinary records to law enforcement authorities could occur without parental consent, to the extent that such disclosure was permitted under FERPA.  In order to more clearly state the Department's longstanding position that consent is required for disclosures of personally identifiable information to parties, other than officials of participating agencies collecting or using the information under this part, unless the information is contained in education records and the disclosure is allowed without parental consent under 34 CFR part 99, we are reorganizing Sec. 300.622(a).</span></dd>

Discussion:  Some commenters, as noted above, seek to limit the scope of the State complaint system.  We believe the broad scope of the State complaint procedures, as permitted in the regulations, is critical to each State's exercise of its general supervision responsibilities.  The complaint procedures provide parents, organizations, and other individuals with an important means of ensuring that the educational needs of children with disabilities are met and provide the SEA with a powerful tool to identify and correct noncompliance with Part B of the Act or of part 300.  We believe placing limits on the scope of the State complaint system, as suggested by the commenters, would diminish the SEA's ability to ensure its LEAs are in compliance with Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations, and may result in an increase in the number of due process complaints filed and the number of due process hearings held.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to specify in the regulations how the SEA should handle a complaint filed against the SEA because Sec. 300.151 clarifies that, if an organization or individual files a complaint, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, that a public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of the Act or part 300, the SEA must resolve the complaint.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.33 and section 612(a)(11) of the Act, the term public agency includes the SEA.  The SEA must, therefore, resolve any complaint against the SEA pursuant to the SEA's adopted State complaint procedures.  The SEA, however, may either appoint its own personnel to resolve the complaint, or may make arrangements with an outside party to resolve the complaint.  If it chooses to use an outside party, however, the SEA remains responsible for complying with all procedural and remediation steps required in part 300.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  It is unnecessary to include regulations requiring States to provide notice of public hearings in multiple languages and alternative formats.  Public agencies are required by other Federal statutes to take appropriate actions to ensure that the public has access, in alternative formats and languages other than English, to public hearings.  The other Federal statutory provisions that apply in this regard are section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 104 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance), title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations in 28 CFR part 35 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, regardless of receipt of Federal funds), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 100 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of Federal financial assistance). </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act in no way prohibits States or LEAs from spending additional State or local funds to provide special education or related services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in excess of those required in Sec. 300.133 and section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, consistent with State law or administrative procedures.  The Act, however, does not provide the Secretary with the authority to waive, in whole or in part, the parentally-placed private school requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144 for States or LEAs that spend State or local funds to provide special education or related services beyond those required under Part B of the Act.  The Secretary, therefore, cannot consider alternative compliance with the parentally-placed private school provisions in the Act and these regulations or consider States and LEAs that use State and local funds to provide services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities beyond the required proportionate share of Federal Part B funds, including providing FAPE to such children, to have met the statutory and regulatory requirements governing parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.

Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires an SEA to develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a State plan for a high cost fund.

Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.

revocation of consent for special education and related services should 
not affect discipline protections because the school has prior 
knowledge that the child has been determined eligible for services. The 
provisions in Sec.  300.534(c), which mirror the language in section 
615(k)(5)(C) of the Act, are clear that once a parent refuses services 
the public agency will not be deemed to have knowledge that the child 
is a child with a disability and the child will be subject to the same 
disciplinary procedures and timelines applicable to general education 
students.

Discussion:  Section 300.301(c), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, requires an initial evaluation to be completed within 60 days of receiving parental consent for evaluation or, if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within such timeframe.  The Department declines to require that a State-established timeframe be less than 60 days or to place additional requirements on States with timeframes of greater than 60 days because the Act gives States the authority to establish different timeframes and imposes no restrictions on State exercise of that authority.

We also have added a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to require that the eligibility report include evidence that when a child has participated in an RTI process, the parents were informed of State policies regarding child performance data that would be collected and the general education services that would be provided; strategies to support the child's rate of learning; and a parent's right to request an evaluation at any time.</span></dd>

Most children will not have a surrogate parent already appointed at this stage of their involvement with services under the Act.  However, if a child has a surrogate parent appointed under Sec. 300.519(c), and the rights of that person to make educational decisions for the child have not been subrogated by a judge under State law, the public agency would have to seek informed parental consent from that person.  </span></dd>

Discussion: Section 606 of the Act requires the Secretary to ensure

Section 300.177(b), consistent with section 606 of the Act, makes clear

Discussion:  The Department does not agree with the commenter that the notification and hearing procedures included in Sec.

When the Secretary proposes to deny a State's eligibility to receive a grant under Part B of the Act, withhold funds, or take other enforcement action, it is important to all parties that the process through which those issues will be decided is clearly described, so that time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions instead of the underlying issues.

Discussion:  The Act does not restrict the use of funds for early intervening services only to LEAs that can demonstrate that all eligible children with disabilities are receiving FAPE.  Section 613(f)(1) of the Act generally permits LEAs to use funds for early intervening services for children in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on children in kindergarten through grade 3) who have not been identified as needing special education or related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment.  No other restrictions on this authority, such as a requirement that the LEA first demonstrate that it is providing FAPE to all eligible children, are specified or appropriate.  The authority to use some Part B funds for early intervening services has the potential to benefit special education, as well as the education of other children, by reducing academic and behavioral problems in the regular educational environment and reducing the number of referrals to special education that could have been avoided by relatively simple regular education interventions.  Therefore, we believe the use of Part B funds for early intervening services should be encouraged, rather than restricted.</span></dd>

States may not assign child find responsibility to public charter

charter schools that operate as LEAs, have other responsibilities under 
the IDEA that may need to be carried out during the school year, such 
as serving a child with a disability who is identified during the

We understand the commenter's concern that this change in the 
regulations may require States to revise their procedures for 
distributing Part B funds, and that there may be some administrative 
burden associated with these changes. However, the importance of 
ensuring consistency across States concerning the distribution of 
section 611 and section 619 funds outweighs the potential 
administrative burden. As previously stated in this preamble, making 
these funds available to LEAs is critical to ensure that each LEA is 
able to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act. We agree with 
commenters that some States have been successful in ensuring small LEAs 
receive allocations when they enroll students with disabilities after 
the school year has begun. However, given that the Act and the 
implementing regulations are silent on whether an SEA must make a 
subgrant to an LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, 
clarification is necessary in Sec. Sec.  300.705(a) and 300.815 to 
remove any ambiguity in this regard. Revising the regulations, rather 
than remaining silent on the issue or issuing guidance, will ensure 
that all States treat LEAs in the same manner, including those LEAs 
that are not serving any children with disabilities, when allocating 
Part B funds.

It is true that, in some cases, a review of documents provided by the parties may be sufficient for the SEA to resolve a complaint and that conducting an on-site investigation or interviews with staff, for example, may be unnecessary.

Discussion:  Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(vi)(I) of the Act, equitable services must be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by the public agency with an individual, association, agency, organization, or other entity.  Section 300.142(a) provides that an LEA may use Part B funds to make public school personnel available in other than public facilities to the extent necessary to provide equitable services for parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools and if those services are not otherwise provided by the private school to children as a benefit provided to all children attending that school.  Under Sec. 300.142(b), an LEA may use Part B funds to pay for the services of an employee of a private school to provide equitable services if the employee performs the services outside of his or her regular hours of duty and the employee performs the services under public supervision and control.  We believe that the regulation is sufficiently clear on this point.</span></dd>

	The Act makes clear that the use of paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained and supervised must be contingent on State law, regulation, and written policy giving States the option of determining whether paraprofessionals and assistants can be used to assist in the provision of special education and related services under Part B of the Act, and, if so, to what extent their use would be permissible.  However, it is critical that States that use paraprofessionals and assistants to assist in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities do so in a manner that is consistent with the rights of children with disabilities to FAPE under Part B of the Act.  There is no need to provide additional guidance on how States and LEAs should use paraprofessionals and assistants because States have the flexibility to determine whether to use them, and, if so, to determine the scope of their responsibilities. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Current Sec. 300.155 was removed from these regulations consistent with section 612(a)(17) of the Act.  The removal of this requirement is also consistent with section 612(a) of the Act, which requires a State to submit a plan that provides assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the State meets the requirements of the Act rather than submitting the actual policies and procedures to the Department.  To alleviate burden, Congress removed the statutory provisions which required that States have policies and procedures on file with the Secretary to ensure that funds paid to the State under Part B of the Act are spent in accordance with the provisions of Part B.  OSEP continues to have responsibility to ensure that States are properly implementing the Act.  Given the statutory change that Congress made to remove the prior requirement, we believe it would be inappropriate to include it in these regulations.</span></dd>

However, even if the IEP Team determines that a hearing aid is an assistive technology device, within the meaning of Sec. 300.5, for a particular child, the public agency is responsible for the provision of the assistive technology device as part of FAPE, only if, as specified in Sec. 300.105, the device is required as part of the child's special education defined in Sec. 300.39, related services defined in Sec. 300.34, or supplementary aids and services defined in Sec. 300.42.  </span></dd>

Discussion: The Department encourages States to involve all 
stakeholders, including those noted by the commenter, in monitoring the 
implementation of Part B of the Act and these regulations. However, 
regulating, as the commenter requested, is not necessary because the 
commenter's concern is adequately addressed through other means. The 
Department engaged a number of stakeholders, including parent and 
advocacy organizations, in developing the Federal monitoring system, 
and continues to ensure that States include broad stakeholder input in 
the development of State targets and improvement activities. 
Additionally, under Sec. Sec.  300.167 through 300.169, regarding the 
State Advisory Panel, States must establish and maintain an advisory 
panel with broad membership for the purpose of providing policy 
guidance with respect to special education and related services for 
children with disabilities in the State. Section 300.169 specifies many 
duties of the State Advisory Panel, including advising the SEA of unmet 
needs in the education of children with disabilities within the State, 
developing corrective action plans to address findings identified in 
Federal monitoring reports under Part B of the Act, and developing and 
implementing policies relating to the coordination of services for 
children with disabilities. All of these activities are integral to the 
effective ongoing monitoring of the full implementation of Part B of

Discussion:  Section 300.135, regarding written affirmation, tracks the language in section 612(a)(10)(A)(iv) of the Act.  Including a requirement in the regulations that the LEA must submit a copy of signed written affirmations to the SEA would place reporting burdens on the LEA that are not required by the Act and that we do not believe are warranted in this circumstance.  We expect that in most circumstances private school officials and LEAs will have cooperative relationships that will not need State involvement.  If private school officials believe that there was not meaningful consultation, they may raise that issue with the SEA through the procedures in Sec. 300.136.  However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude a State from requiring LEAs to submit a copy of the written affirmation obtained pursuant to Sec. 300.135, in meeting its general supervision responsibilities under Sec. 300.149 or as a part of its monitoring of LEAs' implementation of Part B of the Act as required in Sec. 300.600.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended adding the concept of psychological processing disorders to the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.  Several commenters noted that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not fully address the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), which includes a processing disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes.  Several commenters stated that, without requiring documentation of a basic psychological processing disorder, the number of children identified with SLD will significantly increase and the use of assessment tools that have the potential to significantly guide instruction will decrease.  Several commenters stated that failure to consider individual differences in cognitive processing skills reverses more than 20 years of progress in cognitive psychology and developmental neuroscience.  One commenter stated that identifying a basic psychological processing disorder would help ensure that children identified with an SLD are not simply victims of poor instruction.  One commenter stated that the shift away from requiring diagnostic assessments in the area of cognition would make it conceptually impossible to document that a child has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes, as required in the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  If a parent obtains an evaluation at private expense, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that requires a parent to share that evaluation with the public agency.  A privately-funded evaluation that is not shared with a public agency would not be considered an IEE under this regulation.  If, however, the parent chooses to share the evaluation with the public agency, that evaluation may be presented by any party as evidence in a due process hearing, in accordance with Sec. 300.502(c)(2).  Similarly, if a public agency reimburses a parent for an IEE, and the parent disagrees with the results of the IEE, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prevent a public agency from introducing that evaluation in a due process hearing over the parent's objection.  We disagree with the commenters to the extent that they believe that parents should have an expectation of privacy regarding an evaluation that is publicly-funded or for which they seek public funding.

Comment:  Several commenters recommended removing proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4), which allows a State to shorten the time periods for the disclosure of evidence, evaluations, and recommendations for expedited due process hearings to two business days, because it will not give a parent adequate time to prepare for hearings, especially when a parent doesn't have a lawyer.  One commenter stated that because LEAs have possession and control of education records, a reduction to two days for disclosure is unfair and creates a hardship on a parent in preparing for the hearing.  Other commenters stated that this provision is inconsistent with section 615(f)(2) of the Act, which requires that not less than five business days prior to a hearing, parties must disclose all evaluations and recommendations that parties intend to use at a hearing.  A few commenters stated that proposed Sec. 300.532(c)(4) diminishes the protections for children with disabilities and their parents found in the July 20, 1983 regulations, and, therefore, violates section 607(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act.  </span></dd>

The Act does not require children to be identified with a particular disability category for purposes of the delivery of special education and related services.

Discussion:  The reporting requirements in Sec. 300.641(c) are not new.  Section 300.641(c) is the same as current Sec. 300.751(e); State reporting policies therefore should already be consistent with these regulations.  Section 300.641(d) addresses how States must report a child with a disability who has more than one disability for purposes of the annual report of children served under the Act.  Paragraph (d)(1) states that if a child has only two disabilities and those disabilities are deafness and blindness, and the child is not reported as having a developmental delay, that child must be reported under the category of deaf-blindness.  Paragraph (d)(2) states that if a child has more than one disability and is not reported as having deaf-blindness or as having a developmental delay, the child must be reported under the category of multiple disabilities.  We believe that Sec. 300.641(d) is clear that children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability must be included in the category of multiple disabilities.

Discussion:  We believe a one-year timeline is reasonable, and will assist in smooth implementation of the State complaint procedures.  The references to longer periods for continuing violations and for compensatory services claims in current Sec. 300.662(c) were removed to ensure expedited resolution for public agencies and children with disabilities.  Limiting a complaint to a violation that occurred not more than one year prior to the date that the complaint is received will help ensure that problems are raised and addressed promptly so that children receive FAPE.  We believe longer time limits are not generally effective and beneficial to the child because the issues in a State complaint become so stale that they are unlikely to be resolved.  However, States may choose to accept and resolve complaints regarding alleged violations that occurred outside the one-year timeline, just as they are free to add additional protections in other areas that are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.

Discussion:  We do not believe it is necessary to further clarify that the LEA is ultimately responsible for providing services because Sec. 300.154(b)(2) sufficiently requires that if a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for the special education and related services in Sec. 300.154(b)(1), the LEA or State agency responsible for developing the child's IEP must provide or pay for these services to the child in a timely manner.

Section 300.103(c) also addresses timely services and clarifies that, consistent with Sec. 300.323(c), the State must ensure there is no delay in implementing a child's IEP, including any situation in which the source for providing or paying for the special education or related services to a child is being determined.  Section 612(a)(12)(A)(i) of the Act provides that the financial responsibility of public agencies (other than an educational agency), including Medicaid and other public insurers obligated under Federal or State law or assigned responsibility under State policy, must precede financial responsibility of the LEA.  </span></dd>

Comment:  We received a number of comments regarding the phrase, "unless the parent agrees otherwise" in proposed Sec. 300.116(b)(3) and (c).  As proposed, Sec. 300.116(b)(3) requires the child's placement to be as close as possible to the child's home, "unless the parent agrees otherwise;" and Sec. 300.116(c) requires that, unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement, the child must be educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled, "unless the parent agrees otherwise."  Many commenters requested removing the phrase "unless the parent agrees otherwise," because it is not included in section 612(a)(5) of the Act and is not necessary to clarify that a parent may place his or her child in a charter, magnet, or other specialized school without violating the LRE requirements.  Other commenters suggested removing the phrase and clarifying that a decision by the child's parent to send the child to a charter, magnet, or other specialized school is not a violation of the LRE requirements.</span></dd>

Comment:  One commenter noted that Sec. 300.600(c) requires States to use quantifiable indicators and such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance in the monitoring priority areas identified in section 616(a)(3) of the Act.  The commenter expressed concern that this requirement expands the data collection burden on States and focuses on inputs, processes, and whether certain procedural rights are met, rather than focusing on educational results and outcomes for children with disabilities. </span></dd>

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter that allowing a parent 
to revoke consent for special education and related services is 
inconsistent with the requirements in section 614(c)(5) of the Act. 
Section 614(c)(5) of the Act requires that an LEA evaluate a child 
before determining that the child is no longer a child with a 
disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in question and 
the LEA believes the child may no longer be eligible for special 
education services. Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent to revoke 
consent for the continued provision of special education and related 
services and does not trigger an LEA's obligation to conduct an 
evaluation for a child that is receiving services before determining 
that a child is no longer a child with a disability. If a parent 
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and 
related services for his or her child, the public agency is not 
determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability as 
contemplated by section 614(c)(5) of the Act and Sec.  300.305(e). 
Instead, the public agency is discontinuing the provision of special 
education and related services pursuant to the decision of the parent 
and there is no obligation for the LEA to evaluate the child.

Discussion:  In order for a public agency to use the Medicaid or other public benefits or insurance program in which a child participates to provide or pay for services required under the Act, the public agency must provide the benefits or insurance program with information from the child's education records (e.g., services provided, length of the services).  Information from a child's education records is protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232(g) (FERPA), and section 617(c) of the Act.  Under FERPA and section 617(c) of the Act, a child's education records cannot be released to a State Medicaid agency without parental consent, except for a few specified exceptions that do not include the release of education records for insurance billing purposes.  Parental consent requires, among other things, that the parent be fully informed in his or her native language, or other mode of communication, consistent with Sec. 300.9.  Thus, there is no need to change "parental consent" to "informed consent," as recommended by one commenter.  However, we believe it would avoid confusion for the references to "consent" in paragraphs (d) and (e) in Sec. 300.154 to be consistent.

Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.

The changes may indicate a need for remapping, and we would expect that school personnel would communicate with the child's parents about these issues.

States that change their eligibility criteria for SLD may want to carefully consider the reevaluation of children found eligible for special education services using prior procedures.  States should consider the effect of exiting a child from special education who has received special education and related services for many years and how the removal of such supports will affect the child's educational progress, particularly for a child who is in the final year(s) of high school.  Obviously, the group should consider whether the child's instruction and overall special education program have been appropriate as part of this process.  If the special education instruction has been appropriate and the child has not been able to exit special education, this would be strong evidence that the child's eligibility needs to be maintained.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.323(b)(1) provides that, in order for the IFSP to be used as the IEP, the IFSP must contain the IFSP content (including the natural environments statement) in section 636(d) of the Act and be developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under Part B of the Act.  For children who are at least three years of age, the IFSP must also include an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills.

public reports on LEA performance for FFY 2005 year by the time they

Before determining that a child has a specific learning disability, Sec. 300.309(b) requires that the evaluation team consider data that demonstrate that prior to, or as part of the referral process, the child received appropriate instruction in regular education settings and that data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement during instruction was provided to the child's parents.  If the child has not made adequate progress under these conditions after an appropriate period of time, the final regulations further require that the public agency refer the child for an evaluation to determine if special education and related services are needed.  Under the final regulations, the child's parents and the team of qualified professionals, described in Sec. 300.306(a)(1), are permitted to extend the evaluation timelines described in Sec.

Section 300.105(b), regarding the proper functioning of hearing aids, has been removed and redesignated as new Sec. 300.113(a).  We have added a new paragraph (b) in new Sec. 300.113 clarifying that, for a child with a surgically implanted medical device who is receiving special education and related services under this part, a public agency is responsible for routine checking of external components of surgically implanted medical devices, but is not responsible for the post-surgical maintenance, programming, or replacement of a medical device that has been surgically implanted (or of an external component of a surgically implanted medical device).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We are not removing the requirement in Sec. 300.532(c) requiring a resolution meeting because an expedited hearing under section 615(k)(3) of the Act is a due process hearing subject to the provisions in section 615(f) of the Act, including the requirement that the LEA convene a resolution meeting when the parent files a due process complaint.  Recognizing the need to promptly resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary decision, we believe the resolution meeting provides an opportunity for an LEA and parents to resolve a disagreement regarding a disciplinary placement or manifestation determination before the timeframe for conducting a due process hearing begins.  In light of the requirement in section 615(k)(4)(B) of the Act that an expedited hearing must occur within 20 school days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed and a determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing, which is a much shorter time frame than the one for a due process complaint filed pursuant to 615(f) of the Act, we shortened the resolution meeting timeline to fit into the expedited hearing timeline.  Recognizing the need to ensure that the resolution meeting does not delay the expedited hearing if an agreement is not reached, Sec. 300.532(c)(3) provides that the resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint regarding a disciplinary placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), and the hearing may proceed unless the matter is resolved within 15 days of the receipt of the parent's due process complaint requesting the expedited due process hearing, and all the applicable timelines for an expedited due process hearing under paragraph (c) of this section commence.  However, the parties may agree to waive the resolution meeting or agree to use the mediation process.</span></dd>

Therefore, the Department encourages States, to the extent possible, to assist a parent in completing the due process complaint so that it meets the standards for sufficiency.

The IEP requirements in Sec. 300.320(a), consistent with section 614(d) of the Act, clarify that children with disabilities must be provided special education and related services and needed supplementary aids and services to enable them to be involved in and make progress in the general curriculum.  In addition, Sec. 300.323(c)(2) requires that, as soon as possible following the development of an IEP, special education and related services are made available to the child in accordance with the child's IEP.  We believe that these regulations adequately address the commenters' concerns, and that no further clarification is necessary.</span></dd>

Comment: Some commenters raised questions about the protections 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with 
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and 
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the 
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the 
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a 
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One 
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline 
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for 
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained 
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be 
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior 
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the 
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and 
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be 
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if 
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR 
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of 
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under 
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for 
services under Part B of the Act.

Discussion: Section 615(m)(1) of the Act allows, but does not 
require, a State to transfer all rights accorded to parents under Part 
B of the Act to children who have reached the age of majority under 
State law. If State law grants a child who has reached the age of 
majority under State law (except for a child with a disability who has 
been determined to be incompetent under State law) all rights 
previously granted to parents, then the parents' rights are transferred 
to the child as provided in Sec.  300.520(a), enabling that child to 
revoke consent for special education and related services under Sec.  
300.300(b)(4). However, in accordance with section 615(m)(1) of the Act 
and Sec.  300.520(a)(1)(i), the public agency must provide any notice 
required under Part B of the Act to the child and the parents. 
Therefore, the parents would receive prior written notice, consistent 
with Sec.  300.503, of the public agency's proposal to discontinue 
special education and related services based on receipt of the written 
revocation of consent from a child to whom rights transferred under 
Sec.  300.520(a). This parental notice could facilitate discussion 
between the child and parent of the decision to revoke consent and the 
potential ramifications of that decision.

Discussion:  The requirements in section 616(a)(1) of the Act, relating to a State's monitoring responsibilities, are included in the regulations in Sec. 300.600(a).  Further, as indicated in the response to the previous comment, a provision regarding the State's responsibility to monitor LEAs located in the State using the indicators in the monitoring priority areas in section 616(a)(3) of the Act has been added in new Sec. 300.600(d).  Regarding the Secretary's monitoring responsibility, section 616(a)(1) of the Act is clear that the Secretary must monitor implementation of Part B of the Act through the oversight of States' exercise of general supervision and through the State performance plans.  Sections 616(a)(3) and 616(b) further describe the Secretary's responsibilities to monitor States' implementation of Part B of the Act.  In addition, note 253-258 of the Conf. Rpt. No. 108-779, p. 232, provides that the Secretary must request such information from States and stakeholders as is necessary to implement the purposes of the Act, including the use of on-site monitoring visits and file reviews to enforce the requirements of the Act.  We continue to believe it is unnecessary to include the Secretary's obligations in the regulations.

Discussion: Section 300.815, consistent with section 619(g) of the 
Act, requires that each State provide subgrants to LEAs, including 
public charter schools that operate as LEAs in the State, that are 
responsible for providing education to children aged three through five 
years and have established their eligibility under section 613 of the 
Act. Section 613(a) of the Act states that an LEA is eligible for 
assistance under Part B of the Act for a fiscal year if the LEA submits 
a plan that provides assurances to the SEA that the LEA meets each of 
the conditions in section 613(a) of the Act. There is no requirement in 
section 613(a) of the Act that an LEA must be serving preschool 
children with disabilities for an LEA to be eligible for a subgrant. 
Requiring States to make a subgrant to all eligible LEAs responsible 
for providing education to preschool children, including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs, will help ensure that LEAs have Part B 
funds available if they are needed to conduct child find activities or 
to serve preschool children with disabilities who subsequently enroll 
or are identified during the school year. As in the past, LEAs may use 
section 619 funds for direct services to preschool children with

and professional development.

Indicator 15 in the SPP measures the effectiveness of a State's 
general supervision by determining the percentage of noncompliance that 
was corrected within one year of identification. It is the Department's 
longstanding position, as reflected in Indicator 15 of the SPP, that 
when a State identifies noncompliance with the requirements of Part B 
of the Act by its LEAs, the noncompliance must be corrected as soon as 
possible, and in no case later than one year after the State identifies 
the noncompliance. The Department has established a target of 100 
percent for Indicator 15, meaning States are expected to correct 100 
percent of noncompliance as soon as possible, and in no case later than 
one year. Further, in our experience, when a State makes a good faith 
effort to correct noncompliance, the needed corrective actions can be 
accomplished and their effectiveness verified within one year. Finally, 
we expect that in the limited circumstances where correction does not 
occur within one year of the State's identification, the State will 
take specific enforcement actions with the LEA that are designed to 
achieve compliance. Section 300.600(e) is consistent with the 
Department's policy and guidance concerning the State's monitoring and 
enforcement responsibilities under Part B of the Act and the reporting

Discussion:  Section 300.152 does not allow an unlimited period of time to resolve a complaint.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that an SEA has a time limit of 60 days after a complaint is filed to issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint (unless, under paragraph (b) of this section, there is an extension for exceptional circumstances or the parties agree to extend the timeline because they are engaged in mediation or in other alternative means of dispute resolution, if available in the State).  We believe the right of parents to file a complaint with the SEA alleging any violation of Part B of the Act or part 300 to receive a written decision within 60 days is reasonable in light of the SEA's responsibilities in resolving a complaint pursuant to its complaint procedures, and is appropriate to the interest of resolving allegations promptly.  In addition, the 60-day time limit for resolving a State complaint is a longstanding requirement and States have developed their State complaint procedures based on the 60-day time limit.  We believe altering this timeframe would be unnecessarily disruptive to States' developed complaint procedures.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Although Congress did not specifically detail a State complaint process in the Act, we believe that the State complaint process is fully supported by the Act and necessary for the proper implementation of the Act and these regulations.  We believe a strong State complaint system provides parents and other individuals an opportunity to resolve disputes early without having to file a due process complaint and without having to go to a due process hearing.  The State complaint procedures are referenced in the following three separate sections of the Act:  (1) Section 611(e)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, which requires that States spend a portion of the amount of Part B funds that they can use for State-level activities on complaint investigations; (2) Section 612(a)(14)(E) of the Act, which provides that nothing in that paragraph creates a private right of action for the failure of an SEA or LEA staff person to be highly qualified or prevents a parent from filing a complaint about staff qualifications with the SEA, as provided for under this part; and (3) Section 615(f)(3)(F) of the Act, which states that "[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the right of a parent to file a complaint with the State educational agency."  Paragraph (f)(3) is titled "Limitations on Hearing" and addresses issues such as the statute of limitations and that hearing issues are limited to the issues that the parent has raised in their due process notice.  The Senate Report explains that this provision clarifies that "nothing in section 615 shall be construed to affect a parent's right to file a complaint with the State educational agency, including complaints of procedural violations" (S. Rpt. No. 108-185, p. 41).</span></dd>

Discussion:  The exception referred to by the commenters is already in the regulations.  Section 300.301(d)(2), consistent with section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, states that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers to a new school before an evaluation is completed, if the new public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and new public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.  While the exception to the 60-day timeframe, as stated in section 614(a)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, only applies when a child transfers to a school located in another public agency, we do not believe the language in paragraph (d)(2), as proposed in the NPRM, is necessarily clear on this matter.  We, therefore, have added language in paragraph (d)(2) to provide additional clarity.  We believe it is important that it is understood that the 60-day or State-established timeframe does not apply when a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency.  When a child transfers from one school to another school in the same public agency, we expect that an initial evaluation will be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or within the State-established timeframe.  </span></dd>

	We also understand the commenters' concerns that the requirements in Sec. 300.309(b) may result in untimely evaluations or services and that parents must be fully informed about the school's concerns about their child's progress and interventions provided by the school.  Therefore, we will combine proposed Sec. 300.309(c) and (d), and revise the new Sec. 300.309(c) to ensure that the public agency promptly requests parental consent to evaluate a child suspected of having an SLD who has not made adequate progress when provided with appropriate instruction, which could include instruction in an RTI model, and whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.  We will also add a new Sec. 300.311(a)(7)(ii) to ensure that the parents of a child suspected of having an SLD who has participated in a process that evaluates the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention, are notified about the State's policies regarding collection of child performance data and the general education services that will be provided; strategies to increase their child's rate of learning; and their right to request an evaluation at any time.

Discussion:  Section 300.504(a), consistent with section 615(d)(1)(A) of the Act, requires a public agency to provide parents with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice at least one time in a school year and under the exceptional circumstances specified in Sec. 300.504(a), which includes the first occurrence of the filing of a due process complaint in a school year.  The procedural safeguards notice, which must be written in language understandable to the general public and in the native language of the parent, unless clearly not feasible to do so, must include a full explanation of the Act's procedural safeguards.  If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, Sec. 300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means for the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication and that the parent understands the content of the notice.  Under Sec. 300.504(c)(5)(ii), the notice must inform parents about the opportunity to present and resolve a due process complaint in accordance with the resolution process required in Sec. 300.510 and section 615(f)(1)(B) of the Act, including a party's right to void the resolution agreement within three business days of execution.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We are maintaining the provisions in proposed Sec. 300.518(c), (new Sec. 300.518(d)), but with one modification.  The basis for this regulation is the longstanding judicial interpretation of the Act's pendency provision that when a hearing officer's decision is in agreement with the parent that a change in placement is appropriate, that decision constitutes an agreement by the State agency and the parent for purposes of determining the child's current placement during subsequent appeals.  See, e.g., Burlington School Committee v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Susquenita School District v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 84 (3rd Cir. 1996); Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Administrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635, 641 (9th Cir. 1990).  To clarify that new Sec. 300.518(d) (proposed Sec. 300.518(c)) does not apply to a first-tier due process hearing decision in a State that has two tiers of administrative review, but only to a State-level hearing officer's decision in a one-tier system or State review official's decision in a two-tier system that is in favor of a parent's proposed placement, we are removing the reference to "local agency" in new Sec. 300.518(d).  This change is made to align the regulation more closely with case law.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The hearing referenced in Sec. 300.532(a) and (c) is the same hearing and not separate hearings.  Paragraph (a) in this section states that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding a placement, or the manifestation determination, or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request a hearing.  Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  We believe these regulations will ensure that the basic protections regarding hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States to adjust other procedural rules they may have superimposed on due process hearings in light of the expedited nature of these hearings.  Further, we believe it is important that all the due process protections in Sec.

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 incorporates the definition in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.

The definition in the Act specifically refers to any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of the child and specifically excludes a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Accordingly, we continue to believe it is appropriate to exclude surgically implanted medical devices from this definition.  In response to the second comment, Sec. 300.105(a) requires each public agency to ensure that assistive technology devices (or assistive technology services, or both) are made available to a child with a disability if required as part of the child's special education, related services, or supplementary aids and services.

agency immunity is not necessary because the public agency will not be 
considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available 
to the child if the parent revokes consent for special education and 
related services. Revocation of parental consent releases the LEA from 
liability for providing FAPE from the time the parent revokes consent 
for special education and related services until the time, if any, that 
the child is evaluated and deemed eligible, once again, for special 
education and related services.

Discussion:  Under section 612(a) of the Act, States must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for a grant under the Part B program.  Under section 612(d) of the Act, if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a final determination that a State is not eligible for a grant, the Secretary may not award funds to the State.  The procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.179 through 300.183 detail the process through which the Secretary notifies a State of a proposed ineligibility determination, the hearing available to the State to dispute this proposal, and the process through which the Secretary makes a final determination.  The Secretary's final determination may be appealed through the judicial review procedure described in section 616(e)(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.184.  We decline to address this issue more specifically in the regulations, however, as we think the regulations already adequately convey the idea that only States that the Secretary determines to be eligible can receive a grant.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.190 retains the authority for a by-pass in current Sec. 300.480 and includes additional authority for a by-pass, consistent with section 612(f)(1) of the Act, in cases where the Secretary determines that an SEA, LEA, or public agency has substantially failed, or is unwilling, to provide for equitable participation of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  When the Secretary authorizes a by-pass it is important that all parties understand the process by which the Secretary determines the funds that will be deducted from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act to provide services, as well as the actions that are required before the Secretary takes any final action to implement a by-pass.  When such processes and procedures are clearly described, time, money, and effort are not spent resolving procedural questions.  The requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.190 through 300.198 provide this information and we believe are necessary to clarify and ensure effective implementation of the by-pass provisions in the Act.

Discussion:  We understand and appreciate the importance of having a copy of the original material to ensure accuracy of the files.

Discussion:  Section 300.520(b) recognizes that some States have mechanisms to determine that a child with a disability who has reached the age of majority under State law does not have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program, even though the child has not been determined incompetent under State law.  In such States, the State must establish procedures for appointing the parent (or, if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual) to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the remainder of the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Whether parents may retain the ability to make educational decisions for a child who has reached the age of majority and who can provide informed consent is a matter of State laws regarding competency.  That is, the child may be able to grant the parent a power of attorney or similar grant of authority to act on the child's behalf under applicable State law.

Although it is difficult to estimate the savings from these final regulations, the Secretary expects some savings to be produced because affected special education teachers are not required to demonstrate the same level of content knowledge as other middle and high school teachers of core academic subjects, thereby reducing the amount of additional coursework or professional development that is needed to meet State standards.  The savings depend on the gap between what State standards require in terms of content knowledge for middle and high school teachers in various academic areas and what the affected teachers are able to demonstrate in the academic subjects they are teaching.  Any savings will be offset in part by the cost of developing a means for the affected teachers to demonstrate subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided.  However, this cost is not expected to be significant.

However, this provision should not be construed to permit or encourage the use of paraprofessionals as a replacement for teachers or related services providers who meet State qualification standards.  To the contrary, using paraprofessionals and assistants as teachers or related services providers would be inconsistent with the State's duty to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of Part B of the Act are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.

The Act provides that, in calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds under Part B of the Act that must be spent on parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, the LEAs where the private schools are located, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private elementary schools and secondary schools and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, must conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEAs.  In addition, the obligation of the LEA to spend a proportionate amount of funds to provide services to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools is now based on the total number of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools located in the LEA whether or not the children and their parents reside in the LEA.  </span></dd>

	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </span></dd>

	Under section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, the LEA where the private elementary schools and secondary schools are located, in consultation with private school officials and representatives of parents of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, also is responsible for determining and paying for the services to be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.  We believe this responsibility extends to children from other States who are enrolled in a private school located in the LEA, because section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act clarifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for spending a proportionate amount of its Federal Part B funds on special education and related services for children enrolled by their parents in the private schools located in the LEA.  The Act does not provide an exception for out-of-State children with disabilities attending a private school located in the LEA and, therefore, out-of-State children with disabilities must be included in the group of parentally-placed children with disabilities whose needs are considered in determining which parentally-placed private school children with disabilities will be served and the types and amounts of services to be provided.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The regulations promulgated under section 1111(b)(1) of the ESEA permit States to use alternate achievement standards to evaluate the performance of a small group of children with the most significant cognitive disabilities who are not expected to meet grade-level standards even with the best instruction.  An alternate achievement standard sets an expectation of performance that differs in complexity from a grade-level achievement standard.  Section 602(10)(C)(ii) of the Act, therefore, allows special education teachers teaching exclusively children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards to meet the highly qualified teacher standards that apply to elementary school teachers.  In the case of instruction above the elementary level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided, as determined by the State, in order to effectively teach to those standards.  </span></dd>

We do not agree that allowing middle and high school students with the most significant cognitive disabilities to be taught by teachers who meet the qualifications of a highly qualified elementary teacher fosters low expectations, encourages students to be treated like children, promotes instruction that is not age appropriate, or denies students access to the general curriculum.  Although alternate achievement standards differ in complexity from grade-level standards, 34 CFR 200.1(d) requires that alternate achievement standards be aligned with the State's content standards, promote access to the general curriculum, and reflect professional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible.  In short, we believe that the requirements in Sec. 300.18(c) will ensure that teachers teaching exclusively children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards will have the knowledge to provide instruction aligned to grade-level content standards so that students with the most significant cognitive disabilities are taught a curriculum that is closely tied to the general curriculum.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.18(c)(2) requires that if a teacher (who is teaching exclusively to alternate achievement standards) is teaching students who need instruction above the elementary school level, the teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction needed to effectively teach to those standards.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that teachers exclusively teaching children who are assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards above the elementary level have sufficient subject matter knowledge to effectively instruct in each of the core academic subjects being taught, at the level of difficulty being taught.  For example, if a high school student (determined by the IEP Team to be assessed against alternate achievement standards) has knowledge and skills in math at the 7th grade level, but in all other areas functions at the elementary level, the teacher would need to have knowledge in 7th grade math in order to effectively teach the student to meet the 7th grade math standards.

The team of qualified professionals and the parent of the child must base their decision on careful consideration of information from a variety of sources, consistent with Sec. 300.306(c).  There is nothing in the Act that requires the team of qualified professionals and the parent to consider only health problems that are universally recognized by the medical profession, as requested by the commenters.

Discussion:  We do not believe that the regulations should require public agencies to conduct evaluations for children to meet the entrance or eligibility requirements of another institution or agency because to do so would impose a significant cost on public agencies that is not required by the Act.  While the requirements for secondary transition are intended to help parents and schools assist children with disabilities transition beyond high school, section 614(c)(5) in the Act does not require a public agency to assess a child with a disability to determine the child's eligibility to be considered a child with a disability in another agency, such as a vocational rehabilitation program, or a college or other postsecondary setting.  The Act also does not require LEAs to provide the postsecondary services that may be included in the summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance.

Discussion:  Section 300.304(b)(3) follows the specific language in section 614(b)(2)(C) of the Act and requires that the evaluation of a child use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical and developmental factors.  "Technically sound instruments" generally refers to assessments that have been shown through research to be valid and reliable.  Therefore, it would be redundant to add language requiring that instruments used in reevaluations be based on scientific research methods, as recommended by one commenter.  The phrase "relative contribution," as used in Sec. 300.304(b)(3), generally means that assessment instruments that allow the examiner to determine the extent to which a child's behavior is a result of cognitive, behavioral, physical, or developmental factors may be used in evaluating a child in accordance with Sec. 300.304.

Additionally, in interpreting evaluation data for the purpose of determining eligibility of a child for special education and related services, Sec. 300.306(c) requires each public agency to draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent input, teacher recommendations, as well as information regarding a child's physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior.

consent to special education and related services, the parent also 
should have the right to revoke consent for special education and 
related services, particularly given that the plain language in Sec.  
300.9(c)(1) states that consent may be revoked at any time. Other 
commenters stated that parents are the ultimate experts on their 
children and have a fundamental right to direct their education. One 
commenter stated that schools should not have the right to force 
evaluations or services on a child through legal processes. Another

We do not believe it is necessary to include examples of functional skills in the regulations because the range of functional skills is as varied as the individual needs of children with disabilities.  We also decline to include examples of how functional skills are measured because this is a decision that is best left to public agencies, based on the needs of their children.

Comment:  One commenter recommended that the regulations specify the minimum steps that public agencies must take to obtain consent for initial evaluations from parents of children who are wards of the State.  Another commenter recommended that the regulations define "reasonable efforts," as used in new Sec. 300.300(a)(1)(iii) (proposed Sec. 300.300(a)(2)(i)).

As a matter of practice, public agencies use a variety of methods to contact parents depending on the ways they find to be most efficient and effective for a particular situation.

Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.

However, there is nothing in the Act that requires a child's IEP goals to be aligned with the State's alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.  Additionally, for some children, goals may be needed for activities that are not closely related to a State's academic content and academic achievement standards.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The requirement in current Sec. 300.350(a)(1), regarding a public agency's responsibility to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability in accordance with the child's IEP, is unnecessary, because entitlement to FAPE under the Act includes the provision of special education and related services in accordance with an IEP.  Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) in current Sec. 300.350, regarding accountability for a child achieving his or her goals, are unnecessary because other Federal laws, such as title I of the ESEA, already provide sufficient motivation for agency effort to assist children with disabilities in making academic progress.  Current Sec. 300.350(c), regarding the rights of parents to invoke due process procedures if a parent feels that efforts are not being made to achieve the IEP goals, is unnecessary because it merely provides explanatory information regarding the due process procedures for parents and children that are available in Sec.

Discussion:  It is not necessary to amend the regulations in the manner recommended by the commenters.  To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected, Sec. 300.519(b) requires public agencies to have a method for determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent and for assigning a surrogate parent to a child.  Such methods would include determining whether a court has already appointed a surrogate parent, as provided under Sec. 300.519(c).  Therefore, it is unnecessary to add language requiring LEAs to appoint a surrogate parent unless the juvenile court has already appointed one, as requested by a commenter.  Section 300.519(d)(1) allows a public agency to select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law, and Sec. 300.519(h) requires the SEA to make reasonable efforts to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe a specific timeline for an expedited evaluation or an eligibility determination should be included in these regulations.  What may be required to conduct an evaluation will vary widely depending on the nature and extent of a child's suspected disability and the amount of additional information that would be necessary to make an eligibility determination.  However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.

We maintain that the provisions in section 615(k)(6)(B) of the Act, as reflected in Sec. 300.535(b)(2), must be read consistent with the disclosures permitted under FERPA for the education records of all children.  Under FERPA, personally identifiable information (such as the child's status as a special education child) can only be released with parental consent, except in certain very limited circumstances.

Section 615(k)(7)(D) of the Act is clear that the term serious bodily injury has the meaning given the term in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  That provision defines serious bodily injury as bodily injury, which involves substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.

Discussion:  The commenter is correct that section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act does not specifically state that the LEA must "provide a copy" of the procedural safeguards notice but, that the LEA must "notify" the parent of the LEA's decision to take disciplinary action and of all procedural safeguards accorded under section 615 of the Act.  We believe, however, that implicit in the Act is a much higher standard for "notify" than "remind" parents as suggested by the commenter.  Further, in other places where "notify" is used in the Act, it is clear the meaning of the term is "to provide notice " (for example, section 615(c)(2)(A) and (D) of the Act).  We believe Sec. 300.530(h), which requires the LEA to notify the parents of its decision to change the placement of their child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct and provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504, is reasonable and consistent with the Act.</span></dd>

Previously, special education teachers were not required by Federal law to be certified as special education teachers in their States.  The regulations preclude teachers for whom the special education certification or licensure requirements have been waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis from meeting the definition of a highly qualified special education teacher.

Discussion:  Section 300.600(a), consistent with section 616(a)(1)(C) of the Act, requires States to monitor implementation and enforcement of the Act.  As discussed elsewhere in this section in response to comments regarding Sec. 300.604 (Enforcement), we have revised Sec. 300.600(a) to identify the specific enforcement actions included in Sec. 300.604 that are appropriate for States to use with LEAs.  The new Sec. 300.600(a) identifies specific methods that must be used to ensure correction when an LEA has been determined to need assistance for two consecutive years or to need intervention for three or more consecutive years.  For example, Sec. 300.600(a) refers to Sec. 300.604(b)(2)(i), which discusses the preparation of a corrective action or improvement plan.  In addition, new Sec. 300.608(b) clarifies that States can use other authority available to them to monitor and enforce the Act.  States need the flexibility to select the most appropriate mechanism to ensure correction in a timely manner.  Requiring that corrective action plans be developed in every instance is overly prescriptive when there are multiple methods that can be used.

Discussion:  Contrary to the commenter's assertion that a parent must have legal knowledge to file a complaint, we believe the State complaint procedures, which are under the direct control of the SEA, provide the parent and the school district with mechanisms that allow them to resolve differences without having to resort to a more costly and cumbersome due process complaint, which, by its nature, is litigious.  We believe if a State effectively implements its State complaint procedures, both parents and public agencies will generally find the process efficient and easy to initiate.  We further believe that the requirement in Sec. 300.509 that each SEA must develop model forms to assist parents in filing a State complaint in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153, and in filing a due process complaint in accordance with Sec.

Discussion: Section 612(a)(16)(C)(i) of the IDEA is clear that a State must develop and implement alternate assessments and guidelines for children with disabilities, but does not specify whether the alternate assessments must be based on grade-level academic achievement standards, modified academic achievement standards, or alternate academic achievement standards. Modified academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(e) and alternate academic achievement standards under Sec.200.1(d) are optional. However, having an alternate assessment is not optional if there are children with disabilities who cannot be appropriately assessed with the regular assessment. Therefore, if a State chooses not to develop an alternate assessment based on modified or alternate academic achievement standards, the State must have an alternate assessment based on grade-level academic achievement standards, unless all children with disabilities can be appropriately assessed using the regular assessment.

Discussion:  The changes requested by the commenter cannot be made because they are inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.111(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act, explicitly requires that all children with disabilities residing in the State are identified, located, and evaluated.

We recognize that it is difficult to locate, identify, and evaluate highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities.  However, we strongly believe it is important to stress in these regulations that the States' child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 apply equally to such children.  We also believe it is important to clarify that a child suspected of having a disability but who has not failed, is making academic progress, and is passing from grade to grade must be considered in the child find process as any other child suspected of having a disability.  As noted earlier in the discussion regarding Sec. 300.101, paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 300.111 has been revised to clarify that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Congress recognized the unique problems homeless children face and included several new provisions in the Act to ensure that homeless children and youth with disabilities have access to the same services and supports as all other children with disabilities.  The Department recognizes that the high mobility rates of some homeless children with disabilities (as well as other children, including some children who are in the custody of a State child welfare agency) pose unique challenges when a child is referred for an evaluation, but moves to another district or State before an evaluation can be initiated or completed.  In such cases, the Department believes it is important that the evaluations be completed as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the date on which the child was first referred for evaluation in any LEA.  However, the high mobility rate of these children and their potential range of evaluation needs means that any specific expedited timeframe could be both too long to ensure that all children are evaluated before they move, and too short to be reasonable in all circumstances.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from establishing its own policies to address the needs of homeless children, including adopting a timeframe for initial evaluations that is less than 60 days.  </span></dd>

The use of the term scientifically based in Sec. 300.226(b) is intended to be consistent with the definition of the term scientifically based research in section 9101(37) of the ESEA.  Because this definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion of new Sec. 300.35.

With respect to a draft IEP, we encourage public agency staff to come to an IEP Team meeting prepared to discuss evaluation findings and preliminary recommendations.  Likewise, parents have the right to bring questions, concerns, and preliminary recommendations to the IEP Team meeting as part of a full discussion of the child's needs and the services to be provided to meet those needs.  We do not encourage public agencies to prepare a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, particularly if doing so would inhibit a full discussion of the child's needs.  However, if a public agency develops a draft IEP prior to the IEP Team meeting, the agency should make it clear to the parents at the outset of the meeting that the services proposed by the agency are preliminary recommendations for review and discussion with the parents.  The public agency also should provide the parents with a copy of its draft proposals, if the agency has developed them, prior to the IEP Team meeting so as to give the parents an opportunity to review the recommendations of the public agency prior to the IEP Team meeting, and be better able to engage in a full discussion of the proposals for the IEP.

Discussion:  The criteria for selecting surrogate parents in Sec. 300.519(d)(2)(ii) and (iii), which apply to surrogate parents appointed by a public agency for children with disabilities under Part B of the Act, do not apply to the selection of surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State under the laws of the State.  Section 615(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act provides that, in the case of a child who is a ward of the State, a surrogate parent may alternatively be appointed by the judge overseeing the child's care, provided that the surrogate parent is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the child.  We decline to impose additional requirements for surrogate parents for children who are wards of the State beyond what is required in the Act, so as to interfere as little as possible with State practice in appointing individuals to act for the child.

Discussion:  The State advisory panel, required in Sec. Sec. 300.167 through 300.169, consistent with section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, addresses many of the commenters' suggestions.  The purpose of the State advisory panel, as stated in Sec. 300.167 and section 612(a)(21)(A) of the Act, is to provide policy guidance to the SEA with respect to special education and related services for children with disabilities.  Pursuant to Sec. 300.168 and section 612(a)(21)(B) of the Act, a broad membership is required.  The duties of the panel are, among other things, to advise the SEA on unmet needs, evaluations, and corrective action plans to address findings identified in Federal monitoring reports, consistent with Sec. 300.169 and section 612(a)(21)(D) of the Act.  However, although we believe that broad stakeholder involvement in the development of the State performance plans and annual performance reports is very important, we decline to regulate that a specific group be involved in their development.  We have, however, provided guidance in OSEP's August 9, 2005 memorandum to States, Submission of Part B State Performance Plans and Annual Performance Reports, (OSEP Memo 05-12), located at http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/bapr/index.html, which directs States to provide information in their State performance plans on how they obtained broad input from stakeholders on the State performance plan.  Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to add any further clarification in Sec. 300.600.  </span></dd>

Section 300.321(e)(1) permits certain members of the IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  The previous regulations required that all IEP Team meetings include the parents of the child, at least one regular education teacher (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), at least one special education teacher, a representative of the public agency, and someone who could interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results (who may be one of the other required IEP Team members).  The extent to which public agencies will realize savings from the final regulations depends on which team members are excused from how much of the meeting.  If the average IEP Team meeting lasts 1.5 hours and requires a half an hour of teacher preparation, then we estimate that the opportunity costs for a teacher of attending a meeting (based on average compensation per hour of $48) would be $96.  If we assume an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings are held for each of the 6.947 million children with disabilities, then 8.34 million IEP Team meetings will be held in 2006-2007.  If one teacher could be excused from five percent of these meetings, the final regulation could result in savings of $40 million.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Requiring that the public agency provide an opportunity for the parent who has filed a complaint and the public agency to voluntarily engage in mediation in an effort to resolve a dispute is an appropriate minimum requirement and consistent with the statutory provision in section 615(e) of the Act that voluntary mediation be made available to parties (i.e., parent and public agency) to disputes involving any matter under Part B of the Act, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint.  However, the statute does not require that mediation be available to other parties, and we believe it would be burdensome to expand, through regulation, new Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(ii) (proposed Sec. 300.152(a)(3)(B)) to require that States offer mediation to non-parents.  Although we do not believe we should regulate to require that mediation be offered to non-parents, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would preclude an SEA from permitting the use of mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, if available in the State, to resolve a State complaint filed by an organization or individual other than a parent, and we will add language to Sec. 300.152(b)(1)(ii) to permit extensions of the timeline if the parties are voluntarily engaged in any of these dispute resolution procedures.  In fact, we encourage SEAs and their public agencies to consider alternative means of resolving disputes between the public agency and organizations or other individuals, at the local level, consistent with State law and administrative procedures.  It is up to each State, however, to determine whether non-parents can use mediation or other alternative means of dispute resolution. </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.152 provides that the complaint must be resolved 60 days after a complaint is filed and that the complainant must be given an opportunity to submit additional information, either orally or in writing, about the allegations in the complaint.  Generally, if the additional information a parent submits is on the same or related incident, it would be part of the amended complaint.  If the information submitted by the complainant is on a different or unrelated incident, generally, the new information would be treated as a separate complaint.  On the other hand, if the information submitted by the complainant were on the same incident, generally, the new information would be treated as an amendment to the original complaint.  It is, ultimately, left to each State to determine whether the new information constitutes a new complaint or whether it is related to a pending complaint.  We believe the decision regarding whether the additional information is a new complaint or an amendment to an existing complaint, is best left to the State.  The State must have the flexibility to make this determination based on the circumstances of a particular complaint and consistent with its State complaint process and, therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to regulate further on this matter.</span></dd>

Section 1111(h)(6) of the ESEA requires LEAs to inform parents about the professional qualifications of their children's classroom teachers.  The ESEA requires that at the beginning of each school year, an LEA that accepts title I, part A funding must notify parents of students in title I schools that they can request information regarding their children's classroom teachers, including, at a minimum:  (1) whether the teacher has met the State requirements for licensure and certification for the grade levels and subject-matters in which the teacher provides instruction; (2) whether the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which State qualification or licensing criteria have been waived; (3) the college major and any other graduate certification or degree held by the teacher, and the field of discipline of the certification or degree; and (4) whether the child is provided services by paraprofessionals, and if so, their qualifications.  In addition, each title I school must provide each parent timely notice that the parent's child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who is not highly qualified.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a 
child in a private school when FAPE is at issue does not constitute a 
revocation of consent under Sec.  300.300(b). However, the provisions 
concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by 
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.  
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when 
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at 
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private 
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c) 
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP 
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the 
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to 
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written 
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a 
disagreement between the parent and public agency about the provision 
of FAPE, do not constitute parental revocation of consent for special 
education and related services.

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  The definition of social work services in schools in the 1977 regulations included "mobilizing school and community resources to enable the child to receive maximum benefit from his or her educational program."  As explained in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations, the phrase "to receive maximum benefit" was intended only to provide that the purpose of activities carried out by personnel qualified to provide social work services in schools is to mobilize resources so that a child can learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program.  The language in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations also clarified that this provision did not set a legal standard for that program or entitle the child to a particular educational benefit.  The preamble further explained that, during the public comment period for the 1992 regulations, commenters raised concerns that the term "maximum benefit" appeared to be inconsistent with the decision by the United States Supreme Court in Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982).  Therefore, the phrase was revised to read "to learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program."  This is the same phrase used in the 1999 regulations and in these regulations in Sec. 300.34(c)(14)(iv).  Because the language in the 1977 final regulations did not entitle a child to any particular benefit, the change made in 1992 did not lessen protections for a child, and, therefore, is not subject to section 607(b) of the Act. </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion: Section 615(h)(1) of the Act is clear that parties to a 
due process hearing may be ``accompanied and advised'' by counsel and 
by individuals, such as non-attorney advocates, who have special 
knowledge or training regarding the problems of children with 
disabilities. Nothing in these regulations or State law can limit this 
right. However, neither the Act nor the current regulations 
implementing Part B of the Act address the issue of whether individuals 
who are not attorneys, but have special knowledge or training regarding 
the problems of children with disabilities, may ``represent'' parties 
in due process hearings under the Act. Congress considered the question 
of non-attorney representation during the 2003-2004 IDEA 
reauthorization process. The version of H.R. 1350 passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2003 included a provision giving a party the 
``right to be represented by counsel and by non-attorney advocates and 
to be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or 
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities'' 
(63 Cong. Rec. H3458 and H3495 (daily ed. Apr. 30, 2003)). The final 
version of the bill enacted in 2004, however, did not adopt this 
language. In other areas, though, the Act, as revised in 2004, now 
specifically addresses duties applicable to ``either party, or the 
attorney representing a party'' (see section 615(b)(7)(A) and (B) of 
the Act). Given that the Act is silent regarding the representational 
role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of 
whether non-attorneys may ``represent'' parties to a due process 
hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to 
decide. As the commenter notes, even if a State law prohibits non-
attorney representation in due process hearings, the Act still affords 
parties to due process hearings the right to be accompanied and advised 
by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
problems of children with disabilities.

</dt>
<dd><span class="contentText">
While we agree with the commenters that some areas of noncompliance 
are more difficult to correct than others, we do not agree that the 
timeline should be extended beyond one year. Our experience has been 
that most States can correct noncompliance, including noncompliance 
that is spread broadly across a system, in less than one year from 
identification of the noncompliance. For example, States have required 
the implementation of short-term correction strategies while they are 
developing and implementing a plan for long-term change to ensure 
sustained compliance. An example of a short-term correction strategy 
coupled with a longer-term change might include contracting with speech 
therapists to provide the speech pathology services needed by current 
students while developing an in-district program to support speech 
pathology assistants to become certified speech language pathologists. 
Therefore, Sec.  300.600(e) provides an appropriate timeline for 
correcting noncompliance, including systemic and long-standing 
noncompliance. In cases where a State is unable to correct 
noncompliance within one year of identification, as provided in Sec.  
300.600(e), a State may enter into a compliance agreement with the 
Department under section 457 of GEPA (Compliance Agreement), if the 
Department deems a Compliance Agreement appropriate. The purpose of a 
Compliance Agreement is to allow a State the time needed to correct 
long-standing systemic noncompliance and come into full compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the Federal program as soon as feasible, 
but not later than three years from the date of the Compliance 
Agreement. A Compliance Agreement allows a State to continue to receive 
its grant award under Part B of the Act while it works toward achieving 
full compliance under the terms of the agreement. Section 300.600(e), 
when read together with the provisions in section 457 of GEPA, 
adequately address the commenters' concerns.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.148(b) that a parental placement does not need to meet State standards in order to be "appropriate" under the Act is retained from current Sec. 300.402(c) to be consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985) (Burlington) and Florence County School District Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (Carter).  Under the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, a court may order reimbursement for a parent who unilaterally withdraws his or her child from a public school that provides an inappropriate education under the Act and enrolls the child in a private school that provides an education that is otherwise proper under the Act, but does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.  The Court noted that these standards apply only to public agencies' own programs for educating children with disabilities and to public agency placements of children with disabilities in private schools for the purpose of providing a program of special education and related services.  The Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Burlington that tuition reimbursement is only available if a Federal court concludes "both that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school placement was proper under the Act."  (510 U.S. at 12).  We believe LEAs can avoid reimbursement awards by offering and providing FAPE consistent with the Act either in public schools or in private schools in which the parent places the child.  However, a decision as to whether an LEA's offer or provision of FAPE was proper under the Act and any decision regarding reimbursement must be made by a court or hearing officer.  Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to include in these regulations a provision relieving a public agency of its obligation to provide tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement in a private school if the child did not first receive special education and related services from the LEA.</span></dd>
