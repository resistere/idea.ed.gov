Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device in Sec. 300.5 incorporates the definition in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.  We do not believe the definition should be changed in the manner suggested by the commenters because the changes are inconsistent with the statutory definition.  The definition in the Act specifically refers to any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of the child and specifically excludes a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device.  Accordingly, we continue to believe it is appropriate to exclude surgically implanted medical devices from this definition.  In response to the second comment, Sec. 300.105(a) requires each public agency to ensure that assistive technology devices (or assistive technology services, or both) are made available to a child with a disability if required as part of the child's special education, related services, or supplementary aids and services.  This provision ties the definition to a child's educational needs, which public agencies must meet in order to ensure that a child with a disability receives a free appropriate public education (FAPE). </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.8(b) states that the use of the developmental delay category for a child with a disability aged three through nine, or any subset of that age range, must be made in accordance with Sec. 300.111(b).  Section 300.111(b) gives States the option of adopting a definition of developmental delay, but does not require an LEA to adopt and use the term.  However, if an LEA uses the category of developmental delay, the LEA must conform to both the State's definition of the term and the age range that has been adopted by the State.  If a State does not adopt the category of developmental delay, an LEA may not use that category as the basis for establishing a child's eligibility for special education and related services.  	Based on the comments, it appears that Sec. 300.8(b) has been misinterpreted as stating that LEAs are allowed to establish the age range for defining developmental delay independent of the State.  We believe it is important to avoid such confusion and, therefore, will modify Sec. 300.8(b) to clarify the provision.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of assistive technology device does not list specific devices, nor would it be practical or possible to include an exhaustive list of assistive technology devices.  Whether an augmentative communication device, playback devices, or other devices could be considered an assistive technology device for a child depends on whether the device is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability, and whether the child's individualized education program (IEP) Team determines that the child needs the device in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).  However, medical devices that are surgically implanted, including those used for breathing, nutrition, and other bodily functions, are excluded from the definition of an assistive technology device in section 602(1)(B) of the Act.  The exclusion applicable to a medical device that is surgically implanted includes both the implanted component of the device, as well as its external components.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The overriding rule in Sec. 300.116 is that placement decisions for all children with disabilities must be made on an individual basis and ensure that each child with a disability is educated in the school the child would attend if not disabled unless the child's IEP requires some other arrangement.  However, the Act does not require that every child with a disability be placed in the regular classroom regardless of individual abilities and needs.  This recognition that regular class placement may not be appropriate for every child with a disability is reflected in the requirement that LEAs make available a range of placement options, known as a continuum of alternative placements, to meet the unique educational needs of children with disabilities.  This requirement for the continuum reinforces the importance of the individualized inquiry, not a "one size fits all" approach, in determining what placement is the LRE for each child with a disability.  The options on this continuum must include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions).  These options must be available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP of each child with a disability.  The group determining the placement must select the placement option on the continuum in which it determines that the child's IEP can be implemented in the LRE.  Any alternative placement selected for the child outside of the regular educational environment must include appropriate opportunities for the child to interact with nondisabled peers, to the extent appropriate to the needs of the children, consistent with Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(i).</span></dd>

If a child who is a ward of the State already has a person who meets the definition of parent in Sec. 300.30, and that person is willing and able to assume the responsibilities of a parent under the Act, a surrogate parent might not be needed.

Several commenters noted that many children with hearing, visual, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; or emotional disturbances (ED) also have concomitant learning disabilities that go unidentified, and that these children end up with lower academic and functional achievement levels than they should because an important contributing factor to their learning problems has not been addressed.

However, there is nothing in the Act or these regulations that would prohibit a State from consulting with these or other groups, if the State chooses to do so.

Section 615(k)(7)(D) of the Act is clear that the term serious bodily injury has the meaning given the term in section 1365(3)(h) of title 18, United States Code.  That provision defines serious bodily injury as bodily injury, which involves substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Nothing in the Act permits the Department to expand the definition of serious bodily injury, as used in Sec. 300.530(g), to include a bodily injury beyond that included in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h).

Discussion:  The term "mapping" refers to the optimization of a cochlear implant and is not included in the definition of related services.  Specifically, "mapping" and "optimization" refer to adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant that is necessary for long-term post-surgical follow-up of a cochlear implant.  Although the cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school, the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective.  The exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in Senate Report (S. Rpt.) No. 108-185, p. 8, which states that the Senate committee did not intend that mapping a cochlear implant, or even the costs associated with mapping, such as transportation costs and insurance co-payments, be the responsibility of a school district.  These services and costs are incidental to a particular course of treatment chosen by the child's parents to maximize the child's functioning, and are not necessary to ensure that the child is provided access to education, regardless of the child's disability, including maintaining health and safety while in school.

Discussion: Certain provisions in the Part 300 regulations, such as
the definition of parent in Sec.  300.30 and the requirements regarding
surrogate parents in Sec.  300.519, ensure that a child with a
disability has an individual who can act as a parent to make
educational decisions on behalf of the child. Parent, as defined in
Sec.  300.30, means a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a
foster parent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual
obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from
acting as a parent; a guardian generally authorized to act as the
child's parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the
child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); an
individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent
(including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the
child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child's welfare. The definition of parent also
includes a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with
Sec.  300.519 and section 639(a)(5) of the Act. The duty to appoint a
surrogate parent under Sec.  300.519 arises when no parent can be
identified, the public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate
a parent, the child is a ward of the State, or the child is an
unaccompanied homeless youth, as defined in section 725(6) of the
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434(a)(6)).

Discussion:  Section 300.704(c)(3)(i), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, requires an SEA to develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a State plan for a high cost fund.  Under Sec. 300.704(c)(3)(i)(A), the State plan must, among other components, establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives from LEAs, a definition of a high need child with a disability that meets certain criteria.  This plan must be developed no later than 90 days after the State reserves funds for a high cost fund.  Section 300.704(c)(3)(ii), consistent with section 611(e)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, requires a State to make its final State plan for the high cost fund available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year, including dissemination of such information on the State's Web site.  Although there is nothing in the Act that requires that the public be given the opportunity to comment on the State's plan, there also is nothing in the Act that would prohibit a State from providing an opportunity for public comment prior to finalizing the State's plan for the high cost fund.

Discussion:  Historically, it has been very difficult for the field to come to consensus on the definition of emotional disturbance, which has remained unchanged since 1977.  On February 10, 1993, the Department published a "Notice of Inquiry" in the Federal Register (58 FR 7938) soliciting comments on the existing definition of serious emotional disturbance.  The comments received in response to the notice of inquiry expressed a wide range of opinions and no consensus on the definition was reached.  Given the lack of consensus and the fact that Congress did not make any changes that required changing the definition, the Department recommended that the definition of emotional disturbance remain unchanged.  We reviewed the Act and the comments received in response to the NPRM and have come to the same conclusion.  Therefore, we decline to make any changes to the definition of emotional disturbance.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The list of acute or chronic health conditions in the definition of other health impairment is not exhaustive, but rather provides examples of problems that children have that could make them eligible for special education and related services under the category of other health impairment.

However, we do believe that Tourette syndrome is commonly misunderstood to be a behavioral or emotional condition, rather than a neurological condition.

Comment:  Several commenters supported including travel training in the definition of orientation and mobility services and recommended adding a reference to the definition of travel training in new Sec. 300.39(b)(4) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(4)).  However, other commenters stated that travel training should appear as a distinct related service and should not be included in the definition of orientation and mobility services because children who are blind and visually impaired receive this type of instruction from certified orientation and mobility specialists.  One commenter stated that the regulations should specify that travel training is for children with cognitive or other disabilities.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Through its review of charter schools' access to Federal funding, it has come to the Department's attention that additional guidance is needed regarding whether charter schools that are established as their own LEAs must be nonprofit entities in order to meet the definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28.  The definition of LEA in Sec. 300.28(b)(2) specifically includes a public charter school that is established as an LEA under State law and that exercises administrative control or direction of, or performs a service function for, itself.  For purposes of the Act, the definitions of charter school, elementary school, and secondary school in Sec. Sec. 300.7, 300.13, and 300.36, respectively, require that a public elementary or secondary charter school be a nonprofit entity.  Therefore, a public elementary or secondary charter school established as its own LEA under State law, also must be a nonprofit entity.  Although these regulations do not specifically define nonprofit, the definition in 34 CFR Sec. 77.1 applies to these regulations.  In order to eliminate any confusion on this issue, we will revise the definition of LEA to reflect that a public elementary or secondary charter school that is established as its own LEA under State law must be a nonprofit entity.  </span></dd>

Therefore, we see no need to make the change suggested by the commenter.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We believe that it is not necessary to modify the regulations to include a requirement that a manifestation determination include a case-by-case analysis of the disability of the child because section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act and Sec. 300.530(e) are sufficiently clear that decisions regarding the manifestation determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.  We believe the Act recognizes that a child with a disability may display disruptive behaviors characteristic of the child's disability and the child should not be punished for behaviors that are a result of the child's disability.  The intent of Congress in developing section 615(k)(1)(E) was that, in determining that a child's conduct was a manifestation of his or her disability, it must be determined that "the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, and was not an attenuated association, such as low self-esteem, to the child's disability."  (Note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., p. 225).  The regulation, which follows the statutory language, thus accurately reflects the manner in which the Act describes the behavior of the child is to be considered in the manifestation determination.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The reporting requirements in Sec. 300.641(c) are not new.  Section 300.641(c) is the same as current Sec. 300.751(e); State reporting policies therefore should already be consistent with these regulations.  Section 300.641(d) addresses how States must report a child with a disability who has more than one disability for purposes of the annual report of children served under the Act.  Paragraph (d)(1) states that if a child has only two disabilities and those disabilities are deafness and blindness, and the child is not reported as having a developmental delay, that child must be reported under the category of deaf-blindness.  Paragraph (d)(2) states that if a child has more than one disability and is not reported as having deaf-blindness or as having a developmental delay, the child must be reported under the category of multiple disabilities.  We believe that Sec. 300.641(d) is clear that children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability must be included in the category of multiple disabilities.  To designate deaf-blindness as the primary disability and include children with deaf-blindness who have an additional disability in the category of deaf-blindness would be inconsistent with the requirements in Sec. 300.641(d).  </span></dd>

Sec. 300.114 through 300.118.  Additionally, Sec. 300.17(d) provides that FAPE means that special education and related services are provided in conformity with an IEP that meets the requirements in section 614(d) of the Act.

For purposes of this analysis as it relates to small entities, the Secretary has focused on LEAs because these regulations most directly affect local public agencies.  The analysis uses a definition of small school district developed by the NCES for purposes of its recent publication, Characteristics of Small and Rural School Districts.  In that publication, NCES defines a small school district as "one having fewer students in membership than the sum of (a) 25 students per grade in the elementary grades it offers (usually K-8) and (b) 100 students per grade in the secondary grades it offers (usually 9-12)".  Using this definition, approximately 38 percent of the Nation's public agencies in the 2002-2003 Common Core of Data were considered small and served three percent of the Nation's students.  Approximately 17 percent of children in small districts had IEPs.</span></dd>

We do not believe it is necessary to change the definition to include providing aids, services, and supports to other individuals because Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires each child's IEP to include a statement of the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum, and to participate in extracurricular and other nonacademic activities.  </span></dd>

The use of the term scientifically based in Sec. 300.226(b) is intended to be consistent with the definition of the term scientifically based research in section 9101(37) of the ESEA.  Because this definition of scientifically based research is important to the implementation of Part B of the Act, a reference to section 9101(37) of the ESEA has been added in new Sec. 300.35, and the full definition of the term has been included in the discussion of new Sec. 300.35.

However, we will include the definition of this term from section 3 of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 3002, here for reference.</span></dd>

Moreover, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested that
allowing a parent to revoke consent will affect a public agency's
ability to determine that a child is no longer a child with a
disability. If a public agency believes a child is no longer a child
with a disability then, as required in Sec.  300.305(e), a public
agency must evaluate the child before making that determination. If the
parent disagrees with the eligibility determination, then the parent
may challenge the decision using the due process procedures in section
615 of the Act.

Comment:  Many commenters recommended adding the concept of psychological processing disorders to the eligibility criteria in Sec. 300.309.  Several commenters noted that the criteria in Sec. 300.309 do not fully address the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), which includes a processing disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes.  Several commenters stated that, without requiring documentation of a basic psychological processing disorder, the number of children identified with SLD will significantly increase and the use of assessment tools that have the potential to significantly guide instruction will decrease.  Several commenters stated that failure to consider individual differences in cognitive processing skills reverses more than 20 years of progress in cognitive psychology and developmental neuroscience.  One commenter stated that identifying a basic psychological processing disorder would help ensure that children identified with an SLD are not simply victims of poor instruction.  One commenter stated that the shift away from requiring diagnostic assessments in the area of cognition would make it conceptually impossible to document that a child has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes, as required in the definition of SLD in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe the requirement imposes unduly restrictive administrative requirements.  The Department has consistently maintained that a child with a disability should be educated in a school as close to the child's home as possible, unless the services identified in the child's IEP require a different location.  Even though the Act does not mandate that a child with a disability be educated in the school he or she would normally attend if not disabled, section 612(a)(5)(A) of the Act presumes that the first placement option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom in the school that the child would attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services to facilitate such placement.  Thus, before a child with a disability can be placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to facilitate the child's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered.  Following that consideration, if a determination is made that a particular child with a disability cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, that child could be placed in a setting other than the regular classroom.  </span></dd>

It is up to each State to develop criteria to determine whether a child has a disability, including whether a particular child has an SLD.  In developing their criteria, States may wish to consider how the criteria will be implemented with a child for whom systematic data on the child's response to appropriate instruction is not available.  However, many private schools collect assessment data that would permit a determination of how well a child responds to appropriate instruction.  The group making the eligibility determination for a private school child for whom data on the child's response to appropriate instruction are not available may need to rely on other information to make their determination, or identify what additional data are needed to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.  However, under Sec. 300.306(b), a public agency may not identify any public or private school child as a child with a disability if the determinant factor is lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math. </span></dd>

Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act now requires the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA), to determine whether a child's behavior was a manifestation of the child's disability based on two inquiries:  (1) was the conduct caused by, or did it have a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability; or (2) was the conduct the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the child's IEP?  </span></dd>

When the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of a child's disability but has not previously been addressed in the child's IEP, the IEP Team must review and revise the child's IEP so that the child will receive services appropriate to his or her needs.  Implementation of the behavioral strategies identified in a child's IEP, including strategies designed to correct behavior by imposing disciplinary consequences, is appropriate under the Act and section 504, even if the behavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.  A change in placement that is appropriate and consistent with the child's needs may be implemented subject to the parent's procedural safeguards regarding prior notice (Sec. 300.503), mediation (Sec. 300.506), due process (Sec.

The Act does not require children to be identified with a particular disability category for purposes of the delivery of special education and related services.

Although the Act does not require that each school building in an LEA be able to provide all the special education and related services for all types and severities of disabilities, the LEA has an obligation to make available a full continuum of alternative placement options that maximize opportunities for its children with disabilities to be educated with nondisabled peers to the extent appropriate.  In all cases, placement decisions must be individually determined on the basis of each child's abilities and needs and each child's IEP, and not solely on factors such as category of disability, severity of disability, availability of special education and related services, configuration of the service delivery system, availability of space, or administrative convenience.  </span></dd>

Therefore, we will remove the phrase.  To clarify that the provisions in Sec. 300.300(a)(2) apply only to initial evaluations, and not reevaluations, we will modify both Sec.

However this does not relieve States or the BIA of their responsibility to ensure that the rights of a child who is a ward of a tribe are protected through the appointment of a surrogate parent under Sec. 300.519 when no parent can be identified; when the agency cannot, after reasonable efforts, locate a parent; or when the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenters that Sec. 300.530(d)(5) is inconsistent with section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act because paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes who is responsible for determining the appropriate services for a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, while section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act describes who is responsible for making a manifestation determination.  These are very different and distinct provisions.  Further, section 615(k) of the Act does not specifically address who is responsible for determining the educational services to be provided a child with a disability whose disciplinary removal is a change in placement.  Section 615(k)(1)(E) of the Act, consistent with Sec. 300.530(e), provides that, within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall determine whether the child's conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability.  We believe that in instances where a child's disciplinary removal constitutes a change in placement, and given the length of time of such removals, the IEP Team is the appropriate entity to determine the educational services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  Section 300.530(d)(5) is clear that whenever a removal constitutes a change in placement under Sec. 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines the services the child will be provided. </span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe that the regulations do not need to be amended to clarify "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis" because what constitutes "unique circumstances" is best determined at the local level by school personnel who know the individual child and all the facts and circumstances regarding a child's behavior.  We believe it would impede efforts of school personnel responsible for making a determination as to whether a change in placement for disciplinary purposes is appropriate for a child if the Department attempted to restrict or limit the interpretation of "consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case-basis."  Factors such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to a child with a disability prior to the violation of a school code could be unique circumstances considered by school personnel when determining whether a disciplinary change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability.  We believe providing school personnel the flexibility to consider whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability on a case-by-case basis and to determine what unique circumstances should be considered regarding a child who violates a code of conduct, as provided for under section 615(k)(1)(A) of the Act, will limit the inappropriate removal of a child with a disability from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  We also decline the commenters' suggestion to regulate further about the case-by-case determination in light of the discretion granted under the Act to school personnel in making this determination.</span></dd>

Section 300.530(e) and (f) incorporate the change in the statutory standard for conducting manifestation determination reviews.  Under the prior law, the IEP Team could conclude that the behavior of a child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability only after considering a list of factors, determining that the child's IEP and placement were appropriate, and that FAPE, supplemental services, and behavioral intervention strategies were being provided in a manner consistent with the child's IEP.  Previous law also required the IEP Team to consider whether a child's disability impaired the child's ability to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior in question, and to control such behavior.  The Act eliminated or substantially revised these requirements.  The final regulations simply require an IEP Team to review all relevant information in the child's file to determine if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  The purpose of the change in the law is to simplify the discipline process and make it easier for school officials to discipline children with disabilities when discipline is appropriate and justified.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Although the Act places a strong preference in favor of educating children with disabilities in the regular classroom with appropriate aids and supports, a regular classroom placement is not appropriate for every child with a disability.  Placement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and must be appropriate for the needs of the child.  The courts have generally concluded that, if a child with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other children is significantly impaired, the needs of the child with a disability generally cannot be met in that environment.  However, before making such a determination, LEAs must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the child in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the child with a disability.  If the group making the placement decision determines, that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, the child's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that child at that particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.

Discussion:  Section 602(10) of the Act states that "highly qualified" has the meaning given the term in section 9101 of the ESEA, which clarifies that the requirements regarding highly qualified teachers apply to public school teachers and not teachers teaching as employees of private elementary schools and secondary schools.  As we stated in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section regarding Sec. 300.138 in this subpart and Sec. 300.18 in subpart A, it is the Department's position that the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools.  This includes teachers hired by private elementary schools and secondary schools who teach children with disabilities.  We agree with the commenters that, in many instances, a public agency may choose to place a child with a severe disability and with more intensive educational needs in a private school or facility as a means of providing FAPE.  When the public agency chooses to place a child with a significant disability, or any child with a disability, in a private school as a means of providing FAPE, the public agency has an obligation to ensure that the child receives FAPE to the same extent the child would if placed in a public school, irrespective of whether the private school teachers meet the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c).  FAPE includes not just the special education and related services that a child with a disability receives, but also includes an appropriate preschool, elementary and secondary school education in the State involved.  The required special education and related services must be provided at public expense, at no cost to the parent, in accordance with an IEP, and the education provided to the child must meet the standards that apply to educational services provided by the SEA and LEA (except for the highly qualified teacher requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.18 and 300.156(c)).  In addition, the SEA must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of social work services in schools includes examples of the types of social work services that may be provided.  It is not a prescriptive or exhaustive list.  The child's IEP Team is responsible for determining whether a child needs social work services, and what specific social work services are needed in order for the child to receive FAPE.  Therefore, while conducting a functional behavioral assessment typically precedes developing positive behavioral intervention strategies, we do not believe it is necessary to include functional behavioral assessments in the definition of social work services in schools because providing positive behavioral intervention strategies is just an example of a social work service that might be provided to a child if the child's IEP Team determines that such services are needed for the child to receive FAPE.  Similarly, if a child's IEP Team determines that mobilizing community resources would not be an effective means of enabling the child to learn as effectively as possible because there are no community resources to address the needs of the child, the IEP Team would need to consider other ways to meet the child's needs.  While there is the possibility that a due process hearing might be filed based on a failure to mobilize community resources that do not exist, we do not believe that such a claim could ever be successful, as the regulation does not require the creation of community resources that do not exist.</span></dd>

Discussion: Section 300.300(b)(4) clarifies that parents have the

This is because, consistent with Sec.  300.101, the public agency has

The other Federal statutory provisions that apply in this regard are Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 104 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance), title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations in 28 CFR part 35 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, regardless of receipt of Federal funds), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 100 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of Federal financial assistance).</span></dd>

Discussion:  New Sec. 300.323(f) (proposed Sec. 300.323(e)(1)(ii)), consistent with section 614(d)(2)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, states that, in the case of a child with a disability who enrolls in a new school in another State, the public agency, in consultation with the parents, must provide FAPE to the child, until such time as the public agency conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.306, if determined necessary by the public agency, and develops a new IEP, if appropriate, that is consistent with Federal and State law.  The evaluation conducted by the new public agency would be to determine if the child is a child with a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Therefore, the evaluation would not be a reevaluation, but would be an initial evaluation by the new public agency, which would require parental consent.  If there is a dispute between the parent and the public agency regarding what constitutes comparable services, the dispute could be resolved through the mediation procedures in Sec. 300.506 or, as appropriate, the due process hearing procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.517.  We believe these options adequately address circumstances in which comparable services are considered unreasonable. </span></dd>

Discussion:  These two provisions are not redundant.  Section 300.321(a)(7) requires the public agency to include the child with a disability, when appropriate (not "whenever possible," as stated by the commenter), in the child's IEP Team meeting, and, thus, provides discretion for the parent and the public agency to determine when it is appropriate to include the child in the IEP Team meeting.  Section 300.321(b), on the other hand, requires a public agency to invite a child to attend an IEP Team meeting when the purpose of the meeting will be to consider the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child to reach those goals.  The Department believes it is important for a child with a disability to participate in determining the child's postsecondary goals and for the IEP Team to consider the child's preferences and interests in determining those goals.</span></dd>

Discussion:  If the child's current placement is a special education setting, the child could be removed from the special education setting to another setting for disciplinary reasons.

Section 300.530(b), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(B) of the Act, provides that school personnel may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his or her current placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension.  However, Sec. 300.530(d) is clear that the child who is removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year must continue to receive educational services, to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in his or her IEP.</span></dd>

We continue to believe the child find and special education referral system is an important function of schools, LEAs, and States.  School personnel should refer children for evaluation through the agency's child or special education referral system when the child's behavior or performance indicates that they may have a disability covered under the Act.  Having the teacher of a child (or other personnel) express his or her concerns regarding a child in accordance with the agency's established child find or referral system helps ensure that the concerns expressed are specific, rather than casual comments, regarding the behaviors demonstrated by the child and indicate that the child may be a child with a disability under the Act.  For these reasons, we would encourage those States and LEAs whose child find or referral processes do not permit teachers to express specific concerns directly to the director of special education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the agency, to change these processes to meet this requirement.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the criteria in Sec. 300.530(e)(1) that the LEA, parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team must determine whether a child's conduct is a manifestation of the child's disability is broad and flexible, and would include such factors as the inter-related and individual challenges associated with many disabilities.  The revised manifestation provisions in section 615 of the Act provide a simplified, common sense manifestation determination process that could be used by school personnel.  The basis for this change is provided in note 237-245 of the Conf. Rpt., pp. 224-225, which states, "the Conferees intend to assure that the manifestation determination is done carefully and thoroughly with consideration of any rare or extraordinary circumstances presented."  The Conferees further intended that "if a change in placement is proposed, the manifestation determination will analyze the child's behavior as demonstrated across settings and across time when determining whether the conduct in question is a direct result of the disability."

Discussion:  The Act no longer requires that the appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement be considered when making a manifestation determination.  The Act now requires that the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team must, when making a manifestation determination, determine whether (1) the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability; or (2) the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.  However, Sec. 300.532, consistent with section 615(k)(3) of the Act, does provide that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), may request an expedited due process hearing, which must occur within 20 school days of the date the hearing is requested and must result in a determination within 10 school days after the hearing.  </span></dd>

We believe that using an IEP in lieu of a services plan for these children may not be appropriate in light of the fact that an IEP developed pursuant to section 614(d) of the Act will generally include much more than just those services that a parentally-placed private school child with a disability may receive, if designated to receive services.  There is nothing, however, in these regulations that would prevent a State that provides more services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities than they are required to do under the Act to use an IEP in place of a services plan, consistent with State law.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The changes requested by the commenter cannot be made because they are inconsistent with the Act.  Section 300.111(a)(1)(i), consistent with section 612(a)(3)(A) of the Act, explicitly requires that all children with disabilities residing in the State are identified, located, and evaluated.  This includes children suspected of having developmental delays, as defined in section 602(3)(B) of the Act.  We recognize that it is difficult to locate, identify, and evaluate highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities.  However, we strongly believe it is important to stress in these regulations that the States' child find responsibilities in Sec. 300.111 apply equally to such children.  We also believe it is important to clarify that a child suspected of having a disability but who has not failed, is making academic progress, and is passing from grade to grade must be considered in the child find process as any other child suspected of having a disability.  As noted earlier in the discussion regarding Sec. 300.101, paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 300.111 has been revised to clarify that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.</span></dd>

A new Sec. 300.310(b) has been added to require the eligibility group to use the information obtained from the routine classroom observation or conduct a new observation and to require parental consent for observations conducted after the child is suspected of having a disability and is referred for an evaluation.

Discussion:  Historically, we have referred to "placement" as points along the continuum of placement options available for a child with a disability, and "location" as the physical surrounding, such as the classroom, in which a child with a disability receives special education and related services.  Public agencies are strongly encouraged to place a child with a disability in the school and classroom the child would attend if the child did not have a disability.  However, a public agency may have two or more equally appropriate locations that meet the child's special education and related services needs and school administrators should have the flexibility to assign the child to a particular school or classroom, provided that determination is consistent with the decision of the group determining placement.  It also should be noted that, under section 615(b)(3) of the Act, a parent must be given written prior notice that meets the requirements of Sec. 300.503 a reasonable time before a public agency implements a proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of FAPE to the child.  Consistent with this notice requirement, parents of children with disabilities must be informed that the public agency is required to have a full continuum of placement options, as well as about the placement options that were actually considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.  While public agencies have an obligation under the Act to notify parents regarding placement decisions, there is nothing in the Act that requires a detailed explanation in children's IEPs of why their educational needs or educational placements cannot be met in the location the parents' request.  We believe including such a provision would be overly burdensome for school administrators and diminish their flexibility to appropriately assign a child to a particular school or classroom, provided that the assignment is made consistent with the child's IEP and the decision of the group determining placement.</span></dd>

under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended
(Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, as amended (ADA), and their relationship to children with
disabilities whose parents revoke consent for special education and
related services under the Act. Some commenters questioned whether the
Section 504 and ADA protections would continue to apply, and the
relationship between a Section 504 or ADA plan and an IEP, whenever a
parent withdraws consent for continued services under the IDEA. One
commenter asked whether students would remain eligible for discipline
protections under Section 504 even after a parent revokes consent for
special education and related services. Another commenter maintained
that, under Section 504 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, a child with a disability has a right not to be
discriminated against by imposing disciplinary sanctions for behavior
that is a manifestation of his disability. Several commenters cited the
statement in the Department's March 12, 1999 Analysis of Comments and
Changes to the Final Part B regulations that ``[u]nder Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, children with disabilities may not be
disciplined for behavior that is a manifestation of their disability if
that disciplinary action constitutes a change of placement'' (see 64 FR
12626), and asked how this interpretation affects the use of
disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, protected under
Section 504 and the ADA, but whose parent has revoked consent for
services under Part B of the Act.

Discussion: We disagree with the commenter that allowing a parent
to revoke consent for special education and related services is
inconsistent with the requirements in section 614(c)(5) of the Act.
Section 614(c)(5) of the Act requires that an LEA evaluate a child
before determining that the child is no longer a child with a
disability. This provision applies when eligibility is in question and
the LEA believes the child may no longer be eligible for special
education services. Section 300.300(b)(4) allows a parent to revoke
consent for the continued provision of special education and related
services and does not trigger an LEA's obligation to conduct an
evaluation for a child that is receiving services before determining
that a child is no longer a child with a disability. If a parent
revokes consent for the continued provision of special education and
related services for his or her child, the public agency is not
determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability as
contemplated by section 614(c)(5) of the Act and Sec.  300.305(e).
Instead, the public agency is discontinuing the provision of special
education and related services pursuant to the decision of the parent
and there is no obligation for the LEA to evaluate the child.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  An RTI process does not replace the need for a comprehensive evaluation, and a child's eligibility for special education services cannot be changed solely on the basis of data from an RTI process.  Consistent with Sec. 300.303 and section 614(a)(2) of the Act, a child with a disability must be reevaluated if the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs of the child warrant a reevaluation or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.  A reevaluation must occur no more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise, and at least once every three years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary, to determine whether the child continues to have a disability and to determine the educational needs of the child.  Reevaluations must be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311.  In addition, as noted in Sec. 300.305(e)(1), except for children at the end of their secondary school career, a reevaluation must be done before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability.  In conducting a reevaluation, as noted in Sec. 300.305, consistent with section 614(c) of the Act, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals must review existing evaluation data on the child including evaluations provided by the parents of the child; current classroom-based, local, or State assessments and classroom-based observations; and observations by teachers and related services providers. </span></dd>

Discussion:  As noted in the response to the prior comment, public agencies have a responsibility to ensure that a surrogate parent is carrying out their responsibilities, so there are some circumstances when removal may be appropriate.  A mere disagreement with the decisions of a surrogate parent about appropriate services or placements for the child, however, generally would not be sufficient to give rise to a removal, as the role of the surrogate parent is to represent the interests of the child, which may not be the same as the interests of the public agency.  We do not think a regulation is necessary, however, as we believe that the rights of the child with a disability are adequately protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II), which prohibit retaliation or coercion against any individual who exercises their rights under Federal law for the purpose of assisting children with disabilities by protecting rights protected under those statutes.  See, 34 CFR 104.61, referencing 34 CFR 100.7(e); 28 CFR 35.134.  These statutes generally prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by recipients of Federal financial assistance (Section 504) and prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability by State and local governments (Title II).  </span></dd>

Discussion: We appreciate the commenters' support for this
provision. Concerning the recommendation that the substance of proposed
Sec.300.9(c)(3) be placed in either Sec.Sec.300.618 or 300.624, we
have included the provision in Sec.300.9 because the provision
specifically relates to the definition of consent. Section 300.9(c)
addresses revocation of consent, explaining that consent is voluntary
and may be revoked at any time. Further, Sec.300.9(c) states that the
parent's revocation of consent is not retroactive in that revocation
does not negate an action that has occurred after the consent was given
and before the consent was revoked. Proposed Sec.  300.9(c)(3) further
defines the effect of a parent's revocation of consent on the content
of his or her child's education records. A parent's revocation of
consent is not retroactive; consequently, the public agency would not
be required to amend the child's education records to remove any
references to the child's receipt of special education and related
services in the event the child's parent revokes consent. Therefore, we
decline to follow the commenters' recommendation to remove Sec.
300.9(c)(3) and include the content of this provision in either

However, the commenter's request regarding BIA schools is inconsistent with the Act.  The definition of local educational agency in Sec. 300.28 and section 602(19) of the Act, including the provision on BIA funded schools in section 602(19)(C) of the Act and in Sec. 300.28(c), states that the term "LEA" includes an elementary school or secondary school funded by the BIA, "but only to the extent that the inclusion makes the school eligible for programs for which specific eligibility is not provided to the school in another provision of law and the school does not have a student population that is smaller than the student population of the LEA receiving assistance under the Act with the smallest student population."

Discussion:  As noted in the discussion responding to the previous comment, the list of Indian entities recognized as eligible to receive services from the United States is published in the Federal Register, pursuant to Section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a-1.  The Federal government does not maintain a list of other State Indian tribes.

Discussion:  The statutory language concerning the definition of parent was changed to permit foster parents to be considered a child's parent, unless State law prohibits a foster parent from serving as a parent.  The language in the regulations also recognizes that similar restrictions may exist in State regulations or in contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent, and should be accorded similar deference.  We believe it is essential for LEAs to have knowledge of State laws, regulations, and any contractual agreements between a State or local entity and a foster parent to ensure that the requirements in Sec. 300.30(a)(2) are properly implemented.  States and LEAs should develop procedures to make this information more readily and easily available so that LEAs do not have to engage in extensive fact finding each time a child with a foster parent enrolls in a school.</span></dd>

One commenter asked if the intent of the regulations is to allow a determination that a child has an SLD to take place outside the timeline for an initial evaluation, and stated that without clarification of the intersection between an RTI process (that may, by definition, require additional time beyond that which is permitted for an evaluation) and the required period of time for an initial assessment, the regulations would cause confusion and result in improper evaluations and eligibility determinations.</span></dd>

We do not believe it is necessary to include examples of functional skills in the regulations because the range of functional skills is as varied as the individual needs of children with disabilities.  We also decline to include examples of how functional skills are measured because this is a decision that is best left to public agencies, based on the needs of their children.

	With respect to the definition of significant disproportionality, each State has the discretion to define the term for the LEAs and for the State in general.  Therefore, in identifying significant disproportionality, a State may determine statistically significant levels.  The State's review of its constituent LEAs' policies, practices, and procedures for identifying and placing children with disabilities would occur in LEAs with significant disproportionality in identification, placement, or discipline, based on the examination of the data.  The purpose of this review is to determine if the policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with the Act.  Establishing a national standard for significant disproportionality is not appropriate because there are multiple factors at the State level to consider in making such determinations.  For example, States need to consider the population size, the size of individual LEAs, and composition of State population.  States are in the best position to evaluate those factors.

Discussion:  The Department agrees that proposed Sec. 300.307(a)(1) should be removed.  We believe this will improve the clarity of the regulations and make it easier for parents and professionals to understand.  With respect to permitting LEAs to use discrepancy models, even with the removal of Sec. 300.307(a)(1), States are responsible for developing criteria to determine whether a child is a child with a disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8 and section 602(3) of the Act, including whether a particular child meets the criteria for having an SLD.  Under section 614(b)(6) of the Act, States are free to prohibit the use of a discrepancy model.  States, including States that did not use a discrepancy model prior to the Act, are not required to develop criteria that permit the use of a discrepancy model.  </span></dd>

procedures is needed in Sec.  300.300 or with the comment that
revocation of consent for special education and related services should
not affect discipline protections because the school has prior

provisions in Sec.  300.534(c), which mirror the language in section

the public agency will not be deemed to have knowledge that the child

However, many commenters recommended retaining current Sec. 300.347(a)(7), which requires parents of a child with a disability to be informed about their child's progress at least as often as parents of nondisabled children and for the report to include information on the extent to which the child's progress is sufficient to enable the child to achieve the goals by the end of the year.</span></dd>

Comment:  Many commenters disagreed with changing the age at which transition services must be provided to a child with a disability from 14 years to 16 years.  One commenter recommended that transition services begin at age 13.  Another commenter recommended that transition services begin before high school, because if there is a choice of high schools, transition goals may be a determining factor in the selection process.  A few commenters requested that the regulations clarify that States may continue to begin transition services with the first IEP after the child turns age 14.  Some commenters recommended that transition begin two to four full school years before the child is expected to graduate because some children may exit school at age 17.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The Act and the regulations recognize that school officials need some reasonable degree of flexibility when disciplining children with disabilities who violate a code of student conduct.  Interrupting a child's participation in education for up to 10 school days over the course of a school year, when necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, does not impose an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  Section 300.530(d)(3) is consistent with section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act and current Sec. 300.121(d) and reflects the Department's longstanding position that public agencies need not provide services to a child with a disability removed for 10 school days or less in a school year, as long as the public agency does not provide educational services to nondisabled children removed for the same amount of time.  This position was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988).  We are amending Sec. 300.530(d)(3) to replace "need not" with "is only required to" for greater clarity.

Discussion:  We believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) ensures that children with disabilities removed for brief periods of time receive appropriate services, while preserving the flexibility of school personnel to move quickly to remove a child when needed and determine how best to address the child's needs.  Paragraph (d)(4) of this section is not intended to imply that a public agency may deny educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled for more than 10 school days in a school year, nor is Sec. 300.530(d)(4) intended to always require the provision of services when a child is removed from school for just a few days in a school year.  We believe the extent to which educational services need to be provided and the type of instruction to be provided would depend on the length of the removal, the extent to which the child has been removed previously, and the child's needs and educational goals.  For example, a child with a disability who is removed for only a few days and is performing near grade level would not likely need the same level of educational services as a child with a disability who has significant learning difficulties and is performing well below grade level.

Discussion:  The provisions in Sec. 300.530(d)(4) only address the provision of services in those situations where a removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement is for a short period of time and the removal does not constitute a change in placement.  In many instances, these short-term removals are for one or two days.  We believe that, in these instances, it is reasonable for appropriate school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the teachers of a child, to determine how best to address the child's needs during these relatively brief periods of removal.  We believe it would place an unreasonable burden on school personnel to require that the parent be involved in making the determination of the extent to which services are needed for a child removed for such a short period of time.  We do not believe requiring school personnel to make these decisions under these circumstances imposes an unreasonable limitation on a child with a disability's right to FAPE.  For these reasons, we do not believe Sec. 300.530(d)(4) should be revised to require that the parent be included in the consultation.

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that requiring that a child's behavior must be a manifestation of the child's disability before determining that a series of removals constitutes a change in placement under proposed paragraph (b) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) should be removed.  We believe it is sufficient for the public agency to conclude that a change in placement has occurred if a child has been subjected to a series of removals that total more than 10 school days in a school year, the behaviors are substantially similar in nature, and such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another support the premise that the series of removals constitute a pattern.  However, our removal of the manifestation determination under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2) of this section) does not eliminate the obligation to conduct a manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e) if the public agency's determination is that the series of removals constitutes a change in placement.

Discussion:  The change requested by the commenter is not needed because the public agency, not the private agency, is responsible for providing FAPE to a child who is placed by the public agency in a private school.  Consistent with Sec. 300.146 and section 612(a)(10)(B) of the Act, a public agency that places a child with a disability in a private school or facility as a means of carrying out the requirements of Part B of the Act, must ensure that the child has all the rights of a child with a disability who is served by a public agency, which includes ensuring that the consent requirements in Sec. 300.300 and sections 614(a)(1)(D) and 614(c) of the Act are followed.  A public agency must, therefore, secure the needed consent from the person or persons who have the legal authority to make such decisions, unless the public agency has made other arrangements with the private school or facility to secure that consent.  We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to require the public agency to inform the private school or facility of the persons or persons who have the legal authority to make educational decisions for the child because this will depend on the specific arrangements made by the public agency with a private school or facility and, should, therefore, be determined by the public agency on a case by case basis.  </span></dd>

We also disagree that allowing a parent to revoke consent for the
provision of special education and related services under Sec.
300.300(b)(4) procedurally or substantively lessens protections
provided to children with disabilities as embodied in regulations in
effect on July 20, 1983. As previously stated in response to other
comments, a parent is recognized under the Act as the party responsible
for protecting the child's interest in obtaining appropriate
educational services. It is the Department's position that the
protections provided to children with disabilities are enlarged rather
than lessened by amending the regulations to provide that a parent's
decision to revoke consent for the continued provision of special
education and related services cannot be challenged by the public
agency. Furthermore, the change reflected in Sec.  300.300(b)(4) is
consistent with the legislative changes made to the Act in 2004, which
included adding to section 614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act the
requirement that parental consent be obtained before the public agency
begins to provide special education and related services to their
child. In our view, the better reading of the Act, especially in light
of the Department's long-standing regulatory definition of ``consent,''
which has included the concept that consent can be revoked at any time,
is that a parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of
services cannot be challenged by a public agency any more than a
parent's refusal to provide consent for the initial provision of
special education and related services can be.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Because of the high cost of due process hearings and the low expected cost of conducting a resolution meeting, there would likely be some savings for all parties involved if resolution meetings were relatively successful in resolving disagreements.  For example, California reports an average cost of $18,600 for a due process hearing, while Texas reports having spent an average of $9,000 for a hearing officer's services.  Anticipating that attorneys will participate in approximately 40 percent of the predicted 3,985 resolution meetings (including drafting legally binding agreements when parties reach agreement), we expect resolution meetings to cost just over twice the average cost of IEP Team meetings, or approximately $700 per meeting.  Even with a very low success rate (eight percent), given the expected costs of these meetings compared to the high cost of conducting a hearing, all parties involved would likely realize some modest savings.  However, because disputes that result in formal hearings tend to be the most difficult to resolve, we do not expect that mandatory resolution meetings will be highly successful in resolving such cases.  By definition, these are cases in which the parties are not amenable to using existing alternatives to formal hearings such as mediation.  Moreover, assuming an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000 per due process hearing, even if as many as 20 percent of the 3,985 complaints were successfully resolved through resolution meetings, net savings still would not exceed $10 million.  (Note that it is unclear to what extent data on average mediation and due process hearing costs account for LEA opportunity costs (e.g., cost per teacher and/or administrator participating).  To the extent that these data do not reflect the opportunity costs of participating LEA officials and staff, we have overestimated the potential savings from resolution meetings). </span></dd>

Discussion:  We disagree with the commenter.  The definition of social work services in schools in the 1977 regulations included "mobilizing school and community resources to enable the child to receive maximum benefit from his or her educational program."  As explained in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations, the phrase "to receive maximum benefit" was intended only to provide that the purpose of activities carried out by personnel qualified to provide social work services in schools is to mobilize resources so that a child can learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program.  The language in the preamble to the final 1992 regulations also clarified that this provision did not set a legal standard for that program or entitle the child to a particular educational benefit.  The preamble further explained that, during the public comment period for the 1992 regulations, commenters raised concerns that the term "maximum benefit" appeared to be inconsistent with the decision by the United States Supreme Court in Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982).  Therefore, the phrase was revised to read "to learn as effectively as possible in his or her educational program."  This is the same phrase used in the 1999 regulations and in these regulations in Sec. 300.34(c)(14)(iv).  Because the language in the 1977 final regulations did not entitle a child to any particular benefit, the change made in 1992 did not lessen protections for a child, and, therefore, is not subject to section 607(b) of the Act. </span></dd>

Discussion:  The definition of interpreting services clearly states that interpreting services are used with children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The nature and type of interpreting services required for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and also limited in English proficiency are to be determined by reference to the Department's regulations and policies regarding students with limited English proficiency.  For example, the Department's regulations in 34 CFR part 100, implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, require that recipients of Federal financial assistance ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by students who are limited English proficient, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The requirement to provide services to students who are limited English proficient and others is also governed by various Department policy memoranda including the September 27, 1991 memorandum, "Department of Education Policy Update on Schools' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students With Limited English Proficiency;" the December 3, 1985 guidance document, "The Office for Civil Rights' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures;" and the May 1970 memorandum to school districts, "Identification of discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin," 35 FR 11595.

Discussion: If a parent who revoked consent for special education

evaluation data that includes classroom based, local, or State

Discussion:  Section 614 (a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an SEA, other State agency, or LEA shall conduct a full and individual evaluation of a child before the provision of special education and related services.  In Sec. 300.301(a), we interpret this language as requiring public agencies, as that term is defined in Sec. 300.33, to conduct evaluations, because those are the only agencies in the State responsible for providing FAPE to eligible children.  The same language is used in section 614(a)(1)(B) of the Act to describe the agencies that may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if a child is a child with a disability.

However, failing a State assessment may be one factor in an evaluation considered by the eligibility group.  As required in Sec. 300.304(b)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the evaluation must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant information about the child.  Further, Sec. 300.304(b)(2), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(B) of the Act, is clear that determining eligibility for special education and related services cannot be based on any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability. </span></dd>

The eligibility group also may need to use information from current classroom-based assessments or classroom observations.  On the basis of the available information, the eligibility group may identify other information that is needed to determine whether the child's low achievement is due to a disability, and not primarily the result of lack of appropriate instruction.

	There are compelling policy reasons why the Act's consent override procedures should be limited to children who are enrolled, or who are seeking to enroll, in public school.  Because the school district has an ongoing obligation to educate a public school child it suspects has a disability, it is reasonable for a school district to provide the parents with as much information as possible about their child's educational needs in order to encourage them to agree to the provision of special education services to meet those needs, even though the parent is free, ultimately, to reject those services.  The school district is accountable for the educational achievement of all of its children, regardless of whether parents refuse the provision of educationally appropriate services.

Instead, we believe that parents have the right to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services.

parents of a child with a disability written notice of the proposal to

Section 300.300(a)(3) allows a public agency to override parental refusal to consent to an initial evaluation by utilizing the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process procedures under Sec.

Discussion: We agree with the commenters that the IEP Team (defined
in Sec.  300.23, which includes the child's parents) plays an important
role in the special education decision-making process. For example,
through the development, review and revision of the child's IEP, the
IEP Team determines how to make FAPE available to a child with a
disability. However, the IEP Team does not have the authority to
consent to the provision of special education and related services to a
child. That authority is given exclusively to the parent under section
614(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) of the Act. The Secretary strongly believes that a
parent also has the authority to revoke that consent, thereby ending
the provision of special education and related services to their child.
Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of
special education and related services at any time is consistent with
the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's
rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and
choice in their child's education.

If a parent decides to use an IFSP in lieu of an IEP, the parent must understand that the child will not necessarily receive the same services and supports that are afforded under an IEP.

In Schaffer, only the burden of persuasion was at issue.  The Court held that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is placed on the party on which this burden usually falls--on the party seeking relief--whether that is the parent of the child with a disability or the school district.  Since Supreme Court precedent is binding legal authority, further regulation in this area is unnecessary.  In addition, we are not aware of significant questions regarding the burden of production that would require regulation.</span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(16)(C)(ii) of the Act requires alternate assessments to be aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and academic achievement standards, and if the State has adopted alternate academic achievement standards permitted under 34 CFR Sec. 200.1(d), to measure the achievement of children with disabilities against those standards.  Section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act requires the IEP to include a statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals, designed to meet the child's needs that result from the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.  However, there is nothing in the Act that requires a child's IEP goals to be aligned with the State's alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards.  Additionally, for some children, goals may be needed for activities that are not closely related to a State's academic content and academic achievement standards.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The requirement in current Sec. 300.350(a)(1), regarding a public agency's responsibility to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability in accordance with the child's IEP, is unnecessary, because entitlement to FAPE under the Act includes the provision of special education and related services in accordance with an IEP.  Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) in current Sec. 300.350, regarding accountability for a child achieving his or her goals, are unnecessary because other Federal laws, such as title I of the ESEA, already provide sufficient motivation for agency effort to assist children with disabilities in making academic progress.  Current Sec. 300.350(c), regarding the rights of parents to invoke due process procedures if a parent feels that efforts are not being made to achieve the IEP goals, is unnecessary because it merely provides explanatory information regarding the due process procedures for parents and children that are available in Sec.

The requirements in Sec. 300.530(b) do not permit using repeated disciplinary removals of 10 school days or less as a means of avoiding the change in placement options in Sec. 300.536.

Discussion:  Section 300.520(b) recognizes that some States have mechanisms to determine that a child with a disability who has reached the age of majority under State law does not have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program, even though the child has not been determined incompetent under State law.  In such States, the State must establish procedures for appointing the parent (or, if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual) to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the remainder of the child's eligibility under Part B of the Act.  Whether parents may retain the ability to make educational decisions for a child who has reached the age of majority and who can provide informed consent is a matter of State laws regarding competency.  That is, the child may be able to grant the parent a power of attorney or similar grant of authority to act on the child's behalf under applicable State law.

Discussion:  The exceptions included in Sec. 300.534(c) track the statutory requirements in section 615(k)(5)(C) of the Act.  The intent of Congress in revising section 615(k)(5) of the Act was to "ensure that schools can appropriately discipline students, while maintaining protections for students whom the school had valid reason to know had a disability" and that the provisions in the Act should not have the "unintended consequence of providing a shield against the ability of a school district to be able to appropriately discipline a student."

We are not including time restrictions, as suggested by the commenters, to the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section because we believe such restrictions are unnecessary and could have the unintended consequence of hindering the school's ability to appropriately discipline a child.

Comment:  Numerous commenters recommended removing the reference to manifestation determination in proposed Sec. 300.536(b)(2) (new Sec. 300.536(a)(2)(ii)).  Several of these commenters stated that it is unnecessary since the manifestation determination is reserved for removals longer than 10 school days.  Some commenters stated if the language in proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that a series of removals constitutes a pattern because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year is going to be retained, proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) should be eliminated because it is excessive and has no basis in the Act.  Other commenters found the manifestation determination requirement in proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section "circular" because requiring a child's behavior to be a manifestation of his or her disability before determining that a change in placement has occurred under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this section (new paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) and then requiring that a manifestation determination be conducted under Sec. 300.530(e), whenever a child's removal constitutes a change in placement, is redundant and confusing. </span></dd>

However, Sec. 300.534(d)(2)(i), consistent with section 615(k)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, specifies that the evaluation in these instances be "expedited", which means that an evaluation should be conducted in a shorter period of time than a typical evaluation conducted pursuant to section 614 of the Act, which must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation.  (See section 614(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of the Act).  Further, we believe it would be inappropriate to specify the timeframe from the completion of an evaluation to the determination of eligibility when there is no specific statutory basis to do so.

Discussion:  Section 615(k)(2) of the Act provides that the IEP Team is responsible for determining the interim alternative educational setting for a child with a disability for certain removals that are a change of placement.  In Sec. 300.531, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, we interpret this obligation to apply to all removals that constitute a change of placement for disciplinary reasons, as defined in Sec. 300.536.  We interpret "setting" in this context to be the environment in which the child will receive services, such as an alternative school, alternative classroom, or home setting.  In many instances, the location and the setting or environment in which the child will receive services are the same.  It is possible, however, that a school may have available more than one location that meets the criteria of the setting chosen by the IEP Team.  For example, an LEA may have available two alternative schools that meet the criteria of the interim alternative educational setting chosen by the IEP Team.  In those cases school personnel would be able to assign the child to either of these locations, if the IEP Team has not specified a particular one.  </span></dd>

In other words, manifestation determinations are limited to removals that constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536.  Upon further consideration, we believe the phrase "except for removals that will be for not more than 10 consecutive school days and will not constitute a change in placement under Sec. 300.536" is unnecessary and confusing.

Discussion:  We agree with the commenters that the meaning of the term "disciplinary action" in section 615(k)(1)(H) of the Act, regarding parental notification, is unclear.

On the other hand, we think the suggestion that the term be applied only to removals under Sec. 300.530(g) would inappropriately narrow the application of the notification provision and result in parents not being notified for removals that could reasonably have a significant impact on a child's education, such as a removal for 10 school days or more.

We believe, however, that implicit in the Act is a much higher standard for "notify" than "remind" parents as suggested by the commenter.

States and districts are unlikely to be able to meet these requirements entirely through reciprocity agreements and college and university programs.

Other options States and districts might use to certify the more than 23,000 remaining teachers include assessments of academic skill and subject matter knowledge and professional development.  Assessment requirements for special education teachers vary across States and teaching assignment fields, but most States require at least two subject matter tests, a general test on core content knowledge, and a disability-specific test, for special education teacher certification.  The average cost of each test is $75.  The SPENSE study found that one-fourth of beginning special education teachers who took a certification test reported having to take it more than once before passing.  If States and districts certified the remaining 23,000 teachers through existing assessments and 25 percent of the teachers took the tests twice, the cost would be approximately $4.3 million.  </span></dd>

When changes to a child's IEP are needed after the annual IEP Team meeting for the school year has been held, Sec. 300.324(a)(4) allows the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency to agree to forego a meeting and develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.  Under the previous regulations, the IEP Team was required to reconvene in order to make amendments to an IEP.  Based on our estimate of an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings per child per year, approximately 1.4 million IEP Team meetings beyond the required annual IEP Team meeting would be held during the 2006-2007 school year.  If half of these meetings concerned amendments or modifications to an IEP and parents and agency representatives agreed to forego a meeting and develop a written document in half of these cases, then 350,000 IEP Team meetings would not be needed.  The combined opportunity costs for personnel participating in a typical IEP Team meeting are estimated at $307.

The Act does not give the Department the authority to impose the standards of the Act on public benefits or insurance agencies, when paying for special education.  If, however, a third party provider, such as a public benefits or insurance company, is unable to provide funding for services outside a clinical setting or other specific setting, the public agency cannot use the third party provider's inability to provide such funding as an appropriate justification for not providing a child with a disability FAPE in the LRE.

Discussion:  Section 300.131, consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act, requires that the LEA where private elementary schools and secondary schools in which the child is enrolled are located, not the LEA where the child resides, is responsible for conducting child find, including an individual evaluation for a child with a disability enrolled by the child's parent in a private elementary school or secondary school located in the LEA.  The Act specifies that the LEA where the private schools are located is responsible for conducting both the child find process and the initial evaluation.  Therefore, the LEA where private schools are located may not seek reimbursement from the LEA of residence for the cost of conducting the evaluation or to request that the LEA of residence conduct the evaluation.  However, the LEA where the private elementary school or secondary school is located has options as to how it meets its responsibilities.

Discussion:  The LRE requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.114 through 300.118 apply to all children with disabilities, including preschool children who are entitled to FAPE.  Public agencies that do not operate programs for preschool children without disabilities are not required to initiate those programs solely to satisfy the LRE requirements of the Act.  Public agencies that do not have an inclusive public preschool that can provide all the appropriate services and supports must explore alternative methods to ensure that the LRE requirements are met.  Examples of such alternative methods might include placement options in private preschool programs or other community-based settings.  Paying for the placement of qualified preschool children with disabilities in a private preschool with children without disabilities is one, but not the only, option available to public agencies to meet the LRE requirements.  We believe the regulations should allow public agencies to choose an appropriate option to meet the LRE requirements.  However, if a public agency determines that placement in a private preschool program is necessary as a means of providing special education and related services to a child with a disability, the program must be at no cost to the parent of the child.</span></dd>

The Act places great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities are educated, to the maximum extent appropriate, with children who are nondisabled and are included in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities as appropriate to the needs of the child.  We believe the public agency has an obligation to provide a child with a disability with appropriate aids, services, and other supports, as determined by the IEP Team, if necessary to ensure the child's participation in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities.  Therefore, we will clarify in Sec. 300.117 that each public agency must ensure that children with disabilities have the supplementary aids and services determined necessary by the child's IEP Team for the child to participate in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that child.</span></dd>

	With regard to the comment requesting that the child find and equitable participation requirements for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities not apply in States with dual enrollment, there is no exception in the Act to the child find and equitable participation requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) for States that permit dual enrollment of a child at a parent's discretion.  Therefore, there is no basis to regulate to provide such an exception.  It would be a matter of State or local discretion to decide whether to have a dual enrollment policy and, if established, how it would be implemented.  Whether dual enrollment alters the rights of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under State law is a State matter.  There is nothing, however, in Part B of the Act that would prohibit a State from requiring dual enrollment as a condition for a parentally-placed private school child with a disability to be eligible for services from a public agency.  As long as States and LEAs meet the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.130 through 300.144, the local policy covering enrollment is a matter of State and local discretion. </span></dd>

Comment:  A number of comments were received regarding Sec. 300.114(a)(2)(ii), which requires each public agency to ensure that the removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that the education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  Many commenters recommended replacing "regular educational environment" with "regular classroom" because "regular classroom" is less likely to be misinterpreted to mean any kind of contact with children without disabilities.  A few commenters expressed concern that using the phrase "regular educational environment" weakens the LRE protections.

Discussion:  Section 300.108 describes two considerations that a public agency must take into account to meet the physical education requirements in this section.  First, physical education must be made available equally to children with disabilities and children without disabilities.  If physical education is not available to all children (i.e., children with and without disabilities), the public agency is not required to make physical education available for children with disabilities (e.g., a district may provide physical education to all children through grade 10, but not to any children in their junior and senior years).  Second, if physical education is specially designed to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability and is set out in that child's IEP, those services must be provided whether or not they are provided to other children in the agency.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  We do not believe the commenter's suggested change should be made.  The concepts of "recoupment" and "likelihood of regression or retention" have formed the basis for many standards that States use in making ESY eligibility determinations and are derived from well-established judicial precedents.  (See, for example, Johnson v. Bixby Independent School District 4, 921 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir. 1990); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983); GARC v. McDaniel, 716 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir. 1983)).  States may use recoupment and retention as their sole criteria but they are not limited to these standards and have considerable flexibility in determining eligibility for ESY services and establishing State standards for making ESY determinations.  However, whatever standard a State uses must be consistent with the individually-oriented requirements of the Act and may not limit eligibility for ESY services to children with a particular disability category or be applied in a manner that denies children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE access to necessary ESY services.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The requirement to provide ESY services to children with disabilities who require such services in order to receive FAPE reflects a longstanding interpretation of the Act by the courts and the Department.  The right of an individual child with a disability to receive ESY services is based on that child's entitlement to FAPE under section 612(a)(1) of the Act.  Some children with disabilities may not receive FAPE unless they receive necessary services during times when other children, both disabled and nondisabled, normally would not be served.  We believe it is important to retain the provisions in Sec. 300.106 because it is necessary that public agencies understand their obligation to ensure that children with disabilities who require ESY services in order to receive FAPE have the necessary services available to them, and that individualized determinations about each disabled child's need for ESY services are made through the IEP process.  </span></dd>

However, even if the IEP Team determines that a hearing aid is an assistive technology device, within the meaning of Sec. 300.5, for a particular child, the public agency is responsible for the provision of the assistive technology device as part of FAPE, only if, as specified in Sec. 300.105, the device is required as part of the child's special education defined in Sec. 300.39, related services defined in Sec. 300.34, or supplementary aids and services defined in Sec. 300.42.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.172(a), consistent with section 612(a)(23)(A) of the Act, requires States to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner after the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  As noted in the discussion to the previous comment, the NIMAS is included as Appendix C to Part 300--National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard and was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2006 (71 FR 41084).  The Department believes that States should make every effort to adopt the NIMAS in a timely manner following the publication of the NIMAS in the Federal Register, recognizing that the timelines and requirements for adopting new rules, policies, or procedures vary from State to State.  States choosing to coordinate with the NIMAC must, consistent with section 612(a)(23)(C) of the Act and Sec. 300.172(c) of these regulations, not later than December 3, 2006, as part of any print instructional materials adoption process, procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the publisher of the print instructional materials to:  (1) require the publisher to prepare and, on or before delivery of the print instructional materials, provide the NIMAC with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the NIMAS; or (2) purchase instructional materials from the publisher that are produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.  Clearly, we would expect that these States would have adopted the NIMAS by December 3, 2006.  We decline to require a specific adoption date for all States, however, given the lack of specificity in the Act.  We also decline to include a definition of "adopt" in these regulations because requirements for adopting new rules and policies may vary from State to State.  The Department's view is that it is inherent in the adoption requirement that, at a minimum, upon "adoption" of the NIMAS, a State must accept and use electronic copies of instructional materials in the NIMAS format for the purpose of providing instructional materials to blind or other persons with print disabilities.  Under Sec. 300.172(a), adopting the NIMAS is a State responsibility and does not impose any legal obligations on publishers of instructional materials.  </span></dd>

Discussion: We agree with the commenter that the placement of a
child in a private school when FAPE is at issue does not constitute a
revocation of consent under Sec.  300.300(b). However, the provisions
concerning the placement of a child in a private school when FAPE is at
issue do not need to be referenced in Sec.  300.300, as suggested by
the commenter, because those provisions are clearly outlined in Sec.
300.148. Section 300.148 addresses the steps a parent must take when
enrolling a child with a disability in a private school when FAPE is at
issue. If the parent seeks reimbursement for the cost of the private
school, then the parent must follow the procedures in Sec.  300.148(c)
through (e). The parent must inform the IEP Team at the most recent IEP
Team meeting that he or she is rejecting the placement proposed by the
public agency and must inform the IEP Team of his or her intent to
enroll the child in a private school at public expense or give written
notice 10 business days prior to the removal of the child from the
public school. These actions, which are required in response to a
disagreement between the parent and public agency about the provision
of FAPE, do not constitute parental revocation of consent for special
education and related services.

Discussion: While the dispute resolution mechanisms in section 615
of the Act generally are appropriate to resolve disputes between a
parent and the public agency, it is the Department's position that they
are not appropriate when a parent revokes consent for all special
education and related services. Section 615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and
Sec.  300.507 allow a parent or public agency to file a due process
complaint on any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, and
educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of FAPE to the child. However, section
614(a)(1)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act does not allow an LEA to use the due
process procedures under section 615 of the Act, including mediation,
if a parent refuses to provide consent for the initial provision of
services. If an LEA cannot use the due process procedures in section
615(b)(6)(A) of the Act and Sec.  303.507 to override a parent's
refusal to provide initial consent for services, then an LEA also
should not be allowed to use these due process procedures to override a
parent's revocation of consent for the continued provision of services.
As discussed throughout this preamble, the Secretary believes that
protecting the interest of parents to make the decision as to whether
or not their child receives special education and related services is
consistent with the intent of the Act.

Discussion:  The Department does not believe that an assessment of psychological or cognitive processing should be required in determining whether a child has an SLD.  There is no current evidence that such assessments are necessary or sufficient for identifying SLD.  Further, in many cases, these assessments have not been used to make appropriate intervention decisions.  However, Sec. 300.309(a)(2)(ii) permits, but does not require, consideration of a pattern of strengths or weaknesses, or both, relative to intellectual development, if the evaluation group considers that information relevant to an identification of SLD.  In many cases, though, assessments of cognitive processes simply add to the testing burden and do not contribute to interventions.  As summarized in the research consensus from the OSEP Learning Disability Summit (Bradley, Danielson, and Hallahan, 2002), "Although processing deficits have been linked to some SLD (e.g., phonological processing and reading), direct links with other processes have not been established.  Currently, available methods for measuring many processing difficulties are inadequate.  Therefore, systematically measuring processing difficulties and their link to treatment is not yet feasible....Processing deficits should be eliminated from the criteria for classification...." (p. 797).3  Concerns about the absence of evidence for relations of cognitive discrepancy and SLD for identification go back to Bijou (1942;4 see Kavale, 2002)5.  Cronbach (1957)6 characterized the search for aptitude by treatment interactions as a "hall of mirrors," a situation that has not improved over the past few years as different approaches to assessment of cognitive processes have emerged (Fletcher et al., 2005; Reschly and Tilly, 1999)7.  </span></dd>

Discussion: Once a parent revokes consent for a child to receive
special education and related services, the child is considered a
general education student and will be considered a general education
student under the ESEA. Therefore, if a parent revokes consent after
the school year begins but before administration of the annual State
assessment required under the ESEA, the child is considered a general
education student who has exited special education for accountability
purposes. Section 200.20(f) of the Title I regulations allows States to
include, for a period of up to two AYP determination cycles, the scores
of students who were previously identified with a disability under the
Act, but who no longer receive special education services, in the
special education subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP (but not for
reporting purposes). Therefore, the State may continue to include a
child whose parent revokes consent for special education and related
services in the special education subgroup for purposes of calculating
AYP for two years following parental revocation of consent. While the
State may continue to include the child in the students with
disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating AYP for up to two
years, the child will not have an IEP; therefore, the State will no
longer be required under the IDEA to provide accommodations that were

majority under State law (except for a child with a disability who has

Discussion:  The Act and these regulations encourage parental input and involvement in all aspects of a child's educational program, and provide many opportunities for parents to provide information that becomes part of the child's education record.  For example, Sec. 300.304(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(2)(A) of the Act, requires any evaluation to include information provided by the parent; Sec. 300.305(a)(2), consistent with section 614(c)(1)(B) of the Act, requires the review of existing data for evaluations and reevaluations to include input from the child's parents; Sec. 300.306(a)(1), consistent with section 614(b)(4) of the Act, requires the parent to be part of the group that determines whether the child is a child with a disability and the educational needs of the child; and Sec. 300.321(a)(1), consistent with section 614(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, requires the IEP Team that is responsible for developing, reviewing and revising the child's IEP to include the parent.  In addition, Sec. 300.322(a) specifies the steps a public agency must take to ensure that one or both parents are present at the IEP Team meeting and afforded the opportunity to participate in the meeting.  Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to regulate on this issue.  However, if a parent provides a report for the child's education record and the public agency chooses to maintain a copy of the written report, that report becomes part of the child's education record and is subject to the confidentiality of information requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.610 through 300.627, and FERPA and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99.  </span></dd>

It is not necessary to include regulations to require a public agency to explain the procedural safeguards to parents any time that a change in services is contemplated.

As required in Sec. 300.503(b)(4), the prior written notice must include a statement that the parents have protections under the procedural safeguards of this part.  Consistent with Sec.

Discussion:  Section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that FAPE must be made available to all children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.  Further, section 615(k)(1)(D)(i) of the Act provides that if school personnel seek to order a change in placement of a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, the child must continue to receive education services (as provided in section 612(a)(1) of the Act) so as to enable him or her to continue to participate in the general curriculum, although in another setting (which includes an interim alternative education setting), and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  In other words, while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.  However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  The provision in Sec. 300.530(g)(3), consistent with section 615(k)(1)(G)(iii) of the Act, indicates that school personnel have the discretion to remove a child with a disability who inflicts "serious bodily injury upon another person" from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days (defined in 18 U.S.C. 1365(3)(h) as bodily injury), which involve substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.  Section 300.530(g)(3) applies to school personnel's unilateral removal of a child from the current educational placement.  School officials must seek permission from the hearing officer under Sec. 300.532 to order a change of placement of the child to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting.  Hearing officers have the authority under Sec. 300.532 to exercise their judgments after considering all factors and the body of evidence presented in an individual case when determining whether a child's behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.  Given that the phrase "serious bodily injury," as used in Sec. 300.530(g), has a definitive meaning and the meaning of "substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others" is left to the judgment of the hearing officer, we do not believe further clarification is needed.</span></dd>

Discussion:  The hearing referenced in Sec. 300.532(a) and (c) is the same hearing and not separate hearings.  Paragraph (a) in this section states that a parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding a placement, or the manifestation determination, or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request a hearing.  Paragraph (c) of this section clarifies that a hearing requested under paragraph (a) of this section is an impartial due process hearing consistent with the due process hearing requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 (including hearing rights, such as a right to counsel, presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses, and obtaining a written decision), except that the timelines for the hearing are expedited and a State may establish different procedural rules for expedited due process hearings as long as the rules ensure the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are met.  We believe these regulations will ensure that the basic protections regarding hearings under the Act are met, while enabling States to adjust other procedural rules they may have superimposed on due process hearings in light of the expedited nature of these hearings.  Further, we believe it is important that all the due process protections in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 are maintained because of the importance of the rights at issue in these hearings.</span></dd>

Because fewer factors need to be considered during each manifestation determination review, the time required to conduct such reviews will likely be reduced, and some minimal savings may be realized.  However, the more significant impact relates to secondary effects.  Because it will be less burdensome for school personnel to conduct manifestation determinations, it is reasonable to expect an overall increase in the number of these reviews as school personnel take advantage of the streamlined process to pursue disciplinary actions against those children with disabilities who commit serious violations of student codes of conduct.  This prediction is consistent with a recent GAO report ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), which found that a "sizable minority of principals" voiced concern that discipline policies under previous law impeded proper disciplinary action for students with disabilities, and that some of these comments "may have stemmed from the additional time and resources that principals reportedly use to discipline special education students compared with regular education students."  Even more importantly, the changes in the law will make it easier for review team members to conclude that the behavior in question is not a manifestation of a child's disability, enabling school personnel to apply disciplinary sanctions in more cases involving children with disabilities.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
We have minimal data on the number of manifestation determination reviews being conducted.  However, State-reported data for the 2002-2003 school year suggest that schools are conducting a relatively small number of manifestation reviews.  According to these data, for every 1,000 children with disabilities, approximately 11 will be suspended or expelled for longer than 10 days during the school year (either through a single suspension or as a result of multiple short-term suspensions)--the disciplinary action triggering a manifestation review.  (Please note that we have no way of accurately estimating what portion of short-term suspensions that add up to 10 days would be determined by school personnel to constitute a change in placement.  Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this analysis, that 100 percent of these instances would require a manifestation review because they would be deemed a change in placement).  Based on a recent GAO study ("Student Discipline: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (GAO-01-210)), we assume that under previous law at least 85 percent of manifestation reviews resulted in disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspensions or expulsion).  In other words, approximately 15 percent of all manifestation reviews did not result in disciplinary action because the behavior in question was determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability.  </span></dd>

Section 300.321(e)(1) permits certain members of the IEP Team to be excused from attending an IEP Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of the child with a disability and the public agency agree in writing that the member's attendance is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed.  The previous regulations required that all IEP Team meetings include the parents of the child, at least one regular education teacher (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), at least one special education teacher, a representative of the public agency, and someone who could interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results (who may be one of the other required IEP Team members).  The extent to which public agencies will realize savings from the final regulations depends on which team members are excused from how much of the meeting.  If the average IEP Team meeting lasts 1.5 hours and requires a half an hour of teacher preparation, then we estimate that the opportunity costs for a teacher of attending a meeting (based on average compensation per hour of $48) would be $96.  If we assume an average of 1.2 IEP Team meetings are held for each of the 6.947 million children with disabilities, then 8.34 million IEP Team meetings will be held in 2006-2007.  If one teacher could be excused from five percent of these meetings, the final regulation could result in savings of $40 million.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Act does not give States and other public agencies regulatory authority over private schools and does not place requirements on private schools.  The Act imposes requirements on States and public agencies that refer to or place children with disabilities in private schools for the purposes of providing FAPE to those children because the public agency is unable to provide FAPE in a public school or program.  The licensing and regulation of private schools are matters of State law.  The Act requires States and public agencies, including LEAs, to ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in mandatory age ranges, and that the rights and protections of the Act are extended to eligible children and their parents.  If the State or public agency has placed children with disabilities in private schools for purposes of providing FAPE to those children, the State and the public agency must ensure that these children receive the required special education and related services at public expense, at no cost to the parents, in accordance with each child's IEP.  It is the responsibility of the public agency to determine whether a particular private school in which the child with a disability will be placed for purposes of providing FAPE meets the standards that apply to the SEA and LEA and that a child placed by a public agency be afforded all the rights, including FAPE, that the child would otherwise have if served by the public agency directly.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  We do not believe further clarification is needed in Sec. 300.101, as the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in the regulations.  Section 300.101 clarifies that, in order to be eligible to receive funds under Part B of the Act, States must, among other conditions, ensure that FAPE is made available to all children with specified disabilities in mandated age ranges.  The term FAPE is defined in Sec. 300.17 and section 602(9)(D) of the Act as including, among other elements, special education and related services, provided at no cost to parents, in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP).  Sections 300.114 through 300.118, consistent with section 612(a)(5) of the Act, implement the Act's strong preference for educating children with disabilities in regular classes with appropriate aids and supports.  Specifically, Sec. 300.114 provides that States must have in effect policies and procedures ensuring that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.  </span></dd>

Discussion:  Section 300.101(c) provides that a child is eligible to receive special education and related services even though the child is advancing from grade to grade.  Further, it is implicit from paragraph (c) of this section that a child should not have to fail a course or be retained in a grade in order to be considered for special education and related services.  A public agency must provide a child with a disability special education and related services to enable him or her to progress in the general curriculum, thus making clear that a child is not ineligible to receive special education and related services just because the child is, with the support of those individually designed services, progressing in the general curriculum from grade-to-grade or failing a course or grade.  The group determining the eligibility of a child for special education and related services must make an individual determination as to whether, notwithstanding the child's progress in a course or grade, he or she needs or continues to need special education and related services.  However, to provide additional clarity we will revise paragraph (c)(1) of this section to explicitly state that children do not have to fail or be retained in a course or grade in order to be considered eligible for special education and related services.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We believe the regulations place great emphasis on ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum.  New Sec. 300.39(b)(3) (proposed Sec. 300.38(b)(3)) defines specially designed instruction as adapting the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of the child and to ensure access to the general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.  In addition, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the general curriculum is a major focus of the requirements for developing a child's IEP.  For example, Sec. 300.320(a)(1) requires a child's IEP to include a statement of how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; Sec. 300.320(a)(2)(i) requires annual IEP goals to be designed to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and Sec. 300.320(a)(4) requires the IEP to include a statement of the special education and related services the child will receive, as well as the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided, to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  Optimization generally refers to the mapping necessary to make the cochlear implant work properly and involves adjusting the electrical stimulation levels provided by the cochlear implant.  The exclusion of mapping as a related service is not intended to deny a child with a disability assistive technology (e.g., FM system); proper classroom acoustical modifications; educational support services (e.g., educational interpreters); or routine checking to determine if the external component of a surgically implanted device is turned on and working.  Neither does the exclusion of mapping as a related service preclude a child with a cochlear implant from receiving the related services (e.g., speech and language services) that are necessary for the child to benefit from special education services.  As the commenters point out, a child with a cochlear implant may still require related services, such as speech and language therapy, to process spoken language just as other children with hearing loss who use hearing aids may need those services and are entitled to them under the Act if they are required for the child to benefit from special education.  Each child's IEP Team, which includes the child's parent along with school officials, determines the related services, and the amount of services, that are required for the child to benefit from special education.  It is important that the regulations clearly state that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to related services that are determined by the child's IEP Team to be necessary for the child to benefit from special education.  Therefore, we will add language in Sec. 300.34(b) to clarify that a child with a cochlear implant or other surgically implanted medical device is entitled to those related services that are required for the child to benefit from special education, as determined by the child's IEP Team.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
Discussion:  The Department has considered the diversity of comments received and, given the lack of consensus about which individuals should be included in the group that makes eligibility determinations for children suspected of having an SLD, believes that the requirements in current Sec. 300.540 should be retained.  Current Sec. 300.540 states that the eligibility group for children suspected of having SLD must include the child's parents and a team of qualified professionals, which must include the child's regular teacher (or if the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age) or for a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language pathologist or remedial reading teacher.  We believe this allows decisions about the specific qualifications of the members to be made at the local level, so that the composition of the group may vary depending on the nature of the child's suspected disability, the expertise of local staff, and other relevant factors.  For example, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of reading, it might be important to include a reading specialist as part of the eligibility group.  However, for a child suspected of having an SLD in the area of listening comprehension, it might be appropriate for the group to include a speech-language pathologist with expertise in auditory processing disorders.  Current Sec. 300.540 provides flexibility for schools and districts, and ensures that the group includes individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to interpret the evaluation data and make an informed determination as to whether the child is a child with an SLD, and the educational needs of the child.  </span></dd>

<dd><span class="contentText">
However, the Department recognizes that this may not be possible in all circumstances, for example, when a child with a disability transfers to a new school in the middle of a school year.  Additionally, there could be circumstances beyond the control of the public agency that could prevent children with disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats from receiving them at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children, such as if the public agency's contractor is unable to produce the instructional materials in an accessible format because of some unforeseen circumstance.  In situations such as these, it is understandable that the accessible format materials may not be immediately available.  Therefore, we will add a provision to the regulations to specify that in order to meet their obligation to provide accessible format instructional materials in a timely way, public agencies must take all reasonable steps to make those instructional materials available at the same time as instructional materials are provided to other children.  Reasonable steps, for example, would include requiring publishers or other contractors to provide instructional materials in accessible formats by the beginning of the school year for children whom the public agency has reason to believe will be attending its schools.  Reasonable steps also might include having a means of acquiring instructional materials in accessible formats as quickly as possible for children who might transfer into the public agency in the middle of the year.  Reasonable steps would not include withholding instructional materials from other children until instructional materials in accessible formats are available.  To clarify that the obligation to make instructional materials available in a timely manner applies even to States that coordinate with the NIMAC, we are adding a new provision to that effect.  We also are clarifying that the definitions in Sec. 300.172(e) apply to each State and LEA, whether or not the State or LEA chooses to coordinate with the NIMAC.</span></dd>

Discussion:  We recognize that there could be times when parents request that their parentally-placed child be evaluated by different LEAs if the child is attending a private school that is not in the LEA in which they reside.  For example, because most States generally allocate the responsibility for making FAPE available to the LEA in which the child's parents reside, and that could be a different LEA from the LEA in which the child's private school is located, parents could ask two different LEAs to evaluate their child for different purposes at the same time.  Although there is nothing in this part that would prohibit parents from requesting that their child be evaluated by the LEA responsible for FAPE for purposes of having a program of FAPE made available to the child at the same time that the parents have requested that the LEA where the private school is located evaluate their child for purposes of considering the child for equitable services, we do not encourage this practice.  We note that new Sec. 300.622(b)(4) requires parental consent for the release of information about parentally-placed private school children between LEAs; therefore, as a practical matter, one LEA may not know that a parent also requested an evaluation from another LEA.  However, we do not believe that the child's best interests would be well-served if the parents requested evaluations of their child by the resident school district and the LEA where the private school is located, even though these evaluations are conducted for different purposes.  A practice of subjecting a child to repeated testing by separate LEAs in close proximity of time may not be the most effective or desirable way of ensuring that the evaluation is a meaningful measure of whether a child has a disability or of providing an appropriate assessment of the child's educational needs.</span></dd>

Concerning the comments about written notice of the receipt of a
parent's revocation and the public agency's intent to discontinue
services and the comment concerning an opportunity to meet with the
State's PTI center to receive additional information about the
potential effect of the parent's decision, we have not adopted
additional procedures for parental revocation of consent for special
education and related services because the regulations already provide
sufficient notice protections to enable parents to understand the
implications of the decision they are making. To clarify this point, we
have revised Sec.  300.300(b)(4)(i) to specify that prior written
notice consistent with Sec.  300.503 be provided to parents before a
public agency discontinues special education and related services to
their child. Public agencies, under Sec.  300.503, are required to give
the parents of a child with a disability written notice that meets the
requirements in Sec.  300.503(b) within a reasonable time before the
public agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the
identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or
the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the
child. Once a public agency receives a parent's written revocation of
consent for a child's receipt of special education and related
services, the public agency, under Sec.  300.503, must provide prior
written notice to the parent regarding the change in educational
placement and services that will result from the revocation of consent.
The notice must include, among other matters, information on sources
for the parents to contact that can assist the parents in understanding
the requirements of Part B of the Act and its implementing regulations.
Section 300.503(c)(1)(i) also requires that this prior notice be
written in language understandable to the general public. It is
imperative that the public agency provide the required prior notice in
a meaningful manner. Accordingly, Sec.  300.503(c)(1)(ii) requires that
any notice required by Sec.  300.503 must be provided in the native
language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the
parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. Additionally, if
the parent's native language or other mode of communication is not a
written language, Sec.  300.503(c)(2) requires the public agency to
take additional measures to communicate the information contained in
the notice. These measures involve taking steps to ensure that the
notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in the
parent's native language or other mode of communication, that the
parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written
evidence that the requirements of Sec.  300.503(c) have been met.
