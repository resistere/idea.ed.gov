  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), is a United States
  federal law that governs how states and public agencies provide early
  intervention, special education, and related services to children with
  disabilities.
</p>
</div>
<h3>
  Welcome to the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education
  Programs’ (OSEP’s) Part C of the IDEA website.
</h3>
<p>
  This site was created to provide a "one-stop shop" for resources related to
  Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its
  implementing regulations, announced on September 6, 2011.  It is a "living"
  website and will change and grow as resources and information become
  available. When fully implemented, the site will provide searchable versions
  of IDEA and the regulations, access to cross-referenced content from other
  laws (e.g., the Head Start Act, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act
  (FERPA), etc.), webinars on selected topics, non-regulatory guidance, links
  to OSEP's Technical Assistance and Dissemination (TA&D) Network, a Q&A Corner
  where you can submit questions, and a variety of other information sources.
  As items are completed and added to this site, we invite you to grow and
  learn with us as we implement these regulations.
</p><p>
  On September 6, 2011, the U.S. Department of Education announced the release
  of the final regulations for the early intervention program under Part C of
  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  These final
  regulations will help improve services and outcomes for America's infants and
  toddlers with disabilities and their families.
</p><p>
  Part C is a $436 million program administered by States that serves infants
  and toddlers through age 2 with developmental delays or who have diagnosed
  physical or mental conditions with high probabilities of resulting in
  developmental delays.
</p><p>
  The final Part C regulations incorporate provisions in the 2004 amendments to
  Part C of the IDEA.  Additionally, the final regulations provide States with
  flexibility in some areas, while ensuring State accountability to improve
  results and providing needed services for infants and toddlers with
  disabilities and their families.  The regulations focus on measuring and
  improving outcomes for the approximately 350,000 children served by the Part
  C program with the goal of ensuring that such children are ready for
  preschool and kindergarten.
</p><p>
  “As everyone who works in education understands, one of the most important
  things we can offer children is a high-quality early learning experience that
  prepares them for kindergarten,” said U. S. Secretary of Education, Arne
  Duncan.  “This is true for all children – but it’s especially important for
  infants and toddlers with disabilities to have access to high-quality early
  intervention services that prepare them to successfully transition to
  preschool and kindergarten.  The Part C regulations will support the
  Education Department’s commitment to the goal of preparing more children with
  high needs with a strong foundation for success in school and beyond.”

  Register but has not yet been scheduled for publication.  The official

  Register.
